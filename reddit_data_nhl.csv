leafs,lxtzvef,2024-11-18 17:39:17,Honestly I'll take my downvotes  this list should consist of forwards who can win more than one playoff round. 
leafs,lxu0bu0,2024-11-18 17:41:44,For the youngies Gilmour was basically Marner but with a spice and grit to his game.
leafs,lxu8sek,2024-11-18 18:29:34,Imagine being the Leafs top scorer and the best fighter/enforcer at the same time. That was Wendel Clark.
leafs,lxtq99s,2024-11-18 16:48:39,Gilmour over all of them. He actually had heart in the playoffs 
leafs,lxtnmts,2024-11-18 16:35:24,I'd have to say Gilmour than Mathews only because Gilmour single handedly turned what had been probably the worst time period in Leafs hockey into the most exciting next decade of hockey in Toronto since the late 60's.  Still arguably the best trade in Leafs history.Mathews will most likely go down as the best leaf ever drafted and hopefully will lead us to a cup but until then the Gilmour years are the best hockey  of my lifetime.I'd argue though that Mathews/Marner would be similar to Gilmour/Clark as far as impact and how they played off each other so I wouldn't necessarily take Marner off but I'd definitely throw Clark in the mix as well.
leafs,lxtsdph,2024-11-18 16:59:25,Legit question. Seeing all the Clarke over Marner conversations. Matthews is the most gifted goal scorer of his generation has hit 100 points twice?? and has the same playoff lack of pedigree as marner why does he get a free pass to be #1 on the list on top of the wanting to maximize the amount of money the team pays him over his career which is his right and im all for player pay but its not exactly a fan favourite topic.Shouldnt the list be Sundin Gilmour Clarke and then Matthews?? just off of what they have done for the team and its fan base over the last 30-40 years? greatest of all time is something that changes with age shouldnt be a rush to crown people lol.

leafs,lxu77ok,2024-11-18 18:20:27,I would take* Matthews - Could end up being historically the greatest leaf ever and his 1st round pick took us out of a dark era.* Sundin - Likely the best leaf to put on the jersey since the 90s and carried the team for much of his time here.* Felix Potvin - The best homegrown goalie in most of this subs lifetime and backed us to some pretty key playoffs.Finally since we are limited to 90's and later and Clark was most impactful in the 80s..* Doug Gilmour - Not based on talent (although he obviously had it - just we've had better talent then and now) but due to heart drive.
leafs,lxu8xc9,2024-11-18 18:30:20,Replace Matthews & Marner until they have some playoff success and I'm not talking about an SCBut for players of such elite skill in the regular season. They have completed shit the bed in the playoffs for 8 years Maybe this is the year they are playing a different style but this is the regular season. Matthews/Marner/Tavares/Nylander/Rielly absolutely kill the regular year and year but playoffs are a whole different thing

leafs,lxu9v80,2024-11-18 18:35:50,Wendel Clark carried the Leafs from the second he joined the team as a rookie. Doesn’t matter to me who you take down but he has to be one of the four.
leafs,lxtrc8y,2024-11-18 16:54:08,Lol this is rage bait right? Gilmour should be at the top of this list. Between Burns and him the whole culture of the Leafs changed. Sundin should be next. He was traded for one of the best Captains in team history took a lot of crap for it and became one of the best players in Leafs history. Matthews would be next. Austin scores a ton of goals (goals win games) and plays a really underrated complete game. Lastly would be Clark. Him being my favourite player it broke my heart to put him here. The guy sacrificed his body and soul every time he was on the ice. Even when the rest of the team wasn’t wort it. I’ll take heat for leaving Marner out and in no way am I saying he’s a bad player I’ve come around to appreciating the player (still don’t really like the person) but he’s 5th best in my eyes… 
leafs,lxtizsf,2024-11-18 16:12:01,Gilmour is still number one.  When the games mattered most he was at his best especially in 93 and 94 when he was sensational even when playing through injury.  Matthews is an incredible talent of course but his playoff performances have been mediocre considering his abilities.

leafs,lxtmnor,2024-11-18 16:30:24,Read wendels book. The treatments he went through daily just to play and then to play the way he did = absolutely monster. Need to swing the momentum in a game? He could do it with a huge hit a big fight or a huge goal. Had a wicked shot and had absolute jack hammers for fists. God it was fun watching him play.
leafs,lxtox28,2024-11-18 16:41:54,As a fan of both players Marner still has a lot of work to do in order to surpass Clark.    Wendel put it all out there almost putting us into the SCF with a hatty in Game 6 and another pair in Game 7 vs Gretzky’s Kings.    Closest the Leafs have been in my lifetime.   Captain Crunch all the way!

leafs,lxtxgn8,2024-11-18 17:26:21,Maybe???? I’m sorry but it’s definitely Clark over Marner. Simple comparison of Goals/Assists/points etc don’t truly show the impact a player has/had on the team. Clark was way more impactful than Marner IMHO

leafs,lxu7vr6,2024-11-18 18:24:18,"""doesn't treat the puck like a grenade"" was a nice laugh thanks"
leafs,lxttmyl,2024-11-18 17:05:57,The 100pt thing is silly. When you’ve had 99 97 & 94 point seasons does it really matter if he got 1-2 more points?By all accounts his individual playoff stats are ‘fine’ but he hasn’t had a big game 6-7. His playoff points have typically come early in series.So if we want to critique Marner it’s not that he’s not a 100pt player or playoff performer it’s that he hasn’t been a playoff performer at all crunch moment. That’s a specific critique and should be the focus.
leafs,lxtwzz9,2024-11-18 17:23:53,Clarke never even broke 80. And only has 11 more points in the playoffs in 22 more games.

leafs,lxtpnwc,2024-11-18 16:45:40,He needs to do more in points when the series is on the line. Games 5 to 7 his production doesn't just drop it falls off a cliff.Games 1 to 4 he has 9 goals 30 assists for 39 points in 32 games.Games 5+ he has 1 goal and 7 assists for 8 points in 19 gamesHe hasn't scored a goal in games 5+ since 17-18He goes from 1.22 PPG in games 1 to 4 to .42 PPG in games 5+Ya people are in the right to ask more from the guy who threatened to play in Europe to squeeze every dollar from the team.
leafs,lxtoftd,2024-11-18 16:39:27,Marner gets a ton of secondary assists. Not saying matthews is perfect in the playoffs but he has some of our biggest playoff goals the last three years.  Game winner against Tampa in 2022 Two goals to spark comeback in 2023Game winner against Boston last year pPrimary assist on Nylanders game 7 goal last year

leafs,lxtn4ep,2024-11-18 16:32:47,If it's strictly forwards I could be more convinced. I still value playoff performance and results more heavily personally unless you're a franchise leader.
leafs,lxtlkf5,2024-11-18 16:24:54,A lot of this is recency bias. Like Sittler Mahovlich Kennedy etc could all be there legitimately
leafs,lxto4tm,2024-11-18 16:37:55,"Yeah yeah I regret that part of the comment. I clarify what I mean in other comments. I just envision a hypothetical scenario where Matthews stops being a Leaf at this moment.If you simply ask ""Does the #3 goal scorer in franchise history with one Hart and one playoff series win deserve to be on a team's Mt. Rushmore"" then with no further context I'd say probably no. You're shrinking the total pool of players to be post 1990 and that changes it but for me I think you can still argue against it.He's obviously going to snatch that record away this season or next and he's arguably a lock for the Mt. Rushmore of this team for any era because he is a generational talent but that's still only a forecast/trajectory."
leafs,lxtkcoa,2024-11-18 16:18:47,If you ask the same question for the Raptors or Jays then at least 3/4 of your picks are going to be winners. How can you just justify two players from the same team/era that haven't accomplished anything together? What is your justification to include the second best player on a team that only excels in the regular reason?
leafs,lxtmvk5,2024-11-18 16:31:31,Well I wrote this reply to a different user but they deleted their comment. I'll agree I was hasty commenting about Matthews:Why? If they stopped being Leafs at this very moment why include either? Are we looking at the RATE they produce at or the totals? Does loyalty matter? Does winning ing the playoffs matter?Okay excluding Matthews would probably be dumb I agree. Like I said the Hart justifies Matthews being on the list but I wouldn't say he's a lock at this very moment. As soon as he ties/passes the franchise goals record he is an instant include with zero debate the same way that Sundin currently is.If Marner similarly had the assist record (or points) then sure I'd sing a different tune. He's producing at a high rate sure and if he is a Leaf for longer he will inevitably break it but that hasn't happened yet and for me it's not enough.Going on raw total I'd say Kaberle's 437 assists while being a solid defensemen and actually has playoff series wins has a stronger case.But in any case I clearly value playoff performance and results over just stats.
leafs,lxtnf0e,2024-11-18 16:34:17,“Of forwards” - totally missed that!

leafs,lxuab3k,2024-11-18 18:38:24,Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. People don’t have to be children here.  What you said as far as I’m concerned is absolutely true. Wendel carried that team as a rookie and through the 80s and early 90s.
leafs,lxuahla,2024-11-18 18:39:27,Yeah. They ain’t top 5. Just kinda wanted to shout them out for being beasts.
leafs,lxty0rd,2024-11-18 17:29:20,97 in 72 99 in 80 and 85 in 69... his last three seasons are 100-point paces so very silly.
leafs,lxtx9k1,2024-11-18 17:25:18,It's funny people want to hold Marner for not breaking 100 when Clarke never even broke 80.
leafs,lxtvn5i,2024-11-18 17:16:34,And he achieved those numbers on some seasons short of 82 games - so easily already a 100 point guy.
leafs,lxtygn3,2024-11-18 17:31:43,Okay it's pedantic and silly but he's never hit 100 points. People say he is one and he simply isnt. He's been on pace and injured sure but that isn't the same thing as doing it. Just like how Mathews isn't a 70 goal scorer. Marner is a ~95 point player.He disappears during clutch moments and only sometimes seems to be able to drive his own line. He was wildly overpaid for his RFA contract and has a cancerous toxic agent. My vote is for Clark. Better?
leafs,lxtkfne,2024-11-18 16:19:12,Burn it.
leafs,lxtt038,2024-11-18 17:02:39,">Games 5 to 7 his production doesn't just drop it falls off a cliff.I wasn't aware the first 57% of the series meant nothing. Marner haters always gotta move the goal posts to the most absurd shit.""WhAt AbOuT 5 ThRoUgH 7""What about 1 though 4 which is actually the majority of the series? lmfao"
leafs,lxu1lkq,2024-11-18 17:48:38,First of all you missed something in your numbers because yours add up to 47 points in 51 games and marner has 50 in 57.    But there's a good chance the team doesn't get to games 5-7 if mitch doesn't put up points in those games. It's also not weird for ppg to drop in games 5-7 because defence tightens up as a series goes on. It especially hurts them when the powerplay completely loses the ability to even put the puck on net let alone score a goal in the later games.    I never said we shouldn't ask for more from marner all I'm saying is that we need to ask for more from ALL of the stars on the team because with their cap hits we can't afford great depth so they have to carry the offence.    I don't understand why marner gets nitpicked on his stats eve. Though he leads the core 4 in points in the playoffs. He has 50 in 57 matthews has 48 in 55 nylander has 43 in 54. Why do they get a pass for not producing as much? In both totals and in points per game.
leafs,lxtyn9k,2024-11-18 17:32:42,The series was on the line on Game 4 against Columbus.  Why not count that one?
leafs,lxtyyww,2024-11-18 17:34:27,I agree. But writing mitch off because of secondary assists isn't a strong argument. Mitch has been a part of some big goals. He's also made some incredible defensive plays and been a great pker. I'm not even saying he should be above Wendel just that people don't acknowledge what the good that mitch does and just point at the bad stuff
leafs,lxu3glu,2024-11-18 17:58:55,Then don't watch any games until the playoffs
leafs,lxu3dg9,2024-11-18 17:58:26,7 more than willy while being a + and getting tougher matchups lol
leafs,lxtrhbx,2024-11-18 16:54:50,I agree thats why Mats is there. All time pts leader and captained the team to 2 conference finals. Gilmour had the best 2 seasons points wise for a Leafs forward plus his epic 93 playoff run. Although Matthews has not had playoff success its hard to ignore his Calder Hart Lindsay 3 rockets and two 60+ goal seasons.
leafs,lxtlwa4,2024-11-18 16:26:34,It says since 1990. None of those guys played since ‘90
leafs,lxtyiwv,2024-11-18 17:32:03,Literally none of these players accomplished anything. They at most made it 1 round further
leafs,lxto951,2024-11-18 16:38:31,That’s all fair whenever I see the Mount Rushmore topic come up my tendency is to look at individual performance I think. Matthews is a no brainer to me no cups and average individual playoff results by his standards but he has completely killed it in almost every category that he has consistent individual control over.Marner I guess you could take or leave in this discussion I just don’t put as much weight on playoff runs because that’s such a team thing to me and some guys had Cujo behind them while others had Freddie etc. I don’t think I’d put any of the guys you mentioned ahead of him but I guess that’s the fun of these questions!
leafs,lxtpiq9,2024-11-18 16:44:56,All good! I did enjoy the mental image of a fully kitted out Jospeh taking a faceoff though.

In fact he’s even acknowledged that he deserved a spot on the Mount yet you’re questioning as to why someone is here? Who cares?!

leafs,lxuage3,2024-11-18 18:39:15,What did he say that was wrong?  Who cares what team he cheers for. He made a valid point.
leafs,lxu404e,2024-11-18 18:01:59,Clarke also carried the team on his back and lead the leafs to a conference final and what should have been an SCF. He showed up when it counted.
leafs,lxtzwl7,2024-11-18 17:39:27,I mean technically his ppg career average puts him at 91.37 pts across an 82-game season. His last 3-years would shake out as 104.2pts per game for an 82-game season.
leafs,lxtwpwb,2024-11-18 17:22:22,Not saying it means nothing. But when the pressure ramps up Marner folds. It's not moving the goalpost it's giving context. Learn the difference.
leafs,lxu2wyl,2024-11-18 17:55:53,Because his stats fall off the hardest after game 4. It's not hard
leafs,lxu00i9,2024-11-18 17:40:03,Mitch Marner is not a $12m / 100 point / defensive stud in the playoffs. I am getting real tired of people defending mediocrity in this sub!
leafs,lxu3mlv,2024-11-18 17:59:52,I haven’t totally tuned them out. But I need them to prove it when it matters most.
leafs,lxu4vhq,2024-11-18 18:06:57,Not exactly light years.
leafs,lxu5ei4,2024-11-18 18:09:59,You wanna do stats? How many points does marner have in games 4+ Stats are cool and all but we all watch these games especially in the playoffs Willy raises his game the later the series goes marner does not that’s why I’m taking Willy > Marner
leafs,lxtsxze,2024-11-18 17:02:20,Yeah you're right. I was focused on the Hart but he has a lot of other impressive awards too. You could go by all star appearances too which further supports Matthews but that favors Kaberle over Marner too. Wendel is slightly before my time so I'm only speaking to what I experienced but I'd honestly put Kaberle there before Marner still if we're talking skaters.If we are going by rates forecasts and trajectory then sure I'd include Marner but for body of work he certainly isn't higher than #6 for me.
leafs,lxtm3df,2024-11-18 16:27:33,My bad. Missed that. Thanks
leafs,lxtzkh6,2024-11-18 17:37:40,That's kind of the point though isn't it? Picking a Mt. Rushmore is a lot easier when you have multiple champions to choose from. Making it to the conference finals is more impressive than making it to the second round in the same way that winning the President's trophy is better than only winning your division/conference. They are just different degrees of losing in comparison to being Stanley Cup champions.
leafs,lxtp14e,2024-11-18 16:42:29,"Twenty years later I still think man... if we were just a little less injured we maybe had a chance to make it to the finals (ignoring the fact that the Canes were a wagon ofc).If this is all Matthews or Marner accomplished for us I'd imagine in 20 years I'd think ""Wow Matthews was the best scorer we ever had and we had a bunch of stacked teams but they could never get it done in the playoffs"". I really don't think I'd remember them any more fondly than that. To me that isn't a legacy outside of regular season accolades."
leafs,lxu14fs,2024-11-18 17:46:02,Thats right.  It showed up as I scrolled for some reason I get the predators showing up a lot too.
leafs,lxuaz1s,2024-11-18 18:42:16,wow 1 round further you mean the year he had 15 fewer points in the playoffs than Gilmour?the year Gilmour had more points than him in each playoff round?the year he had 3 points against St. Louis?The year Potvin had a .948 against St. Louis?that's not carrying the team.
leafs,lxtxajg,2024-11-18 17:25:27,Everyone folds. It's not as if Matthews and Nylanders have great numbers in 5-7.He is also vastly out produced his team mates in 1 through 4 yet the only thing people focus on is 5-7. What about everyone else? That is why it's moving the goalposts because every time you bring up his production is actually good you find some ridiculous arbitrary thing to blame on him even though it applies to everyone else as well. We don't even make it to gave 56 or 7 if not for his 1 through 4 production so to hold him soley accountable for that is absoultely moving the goalposts.Where's Riellys points? He is an offensive D man who can't play D and doesn't even produce as well. 7.5 million bucks. No one talks about that. It's always just Marner Marner MArner. And then you wonder why he has such attitude problems with the media and fanbase. Because he constantly gets attacked and blamed for things that aren't even his fault.
leafs,lxu3lut,2024-11-18 17:59:45,It is hard. Because there is no game 5-7 without winning in games 1-4. Its all relevant.
leafs,lxu3cte,2024-11-18 17:58:20,? Marner doesnt make 12 mil in the regular season or playoffs. He has been a defensive stud. And technically his ppg puts him at a 72 point player in playoffs but that's still better than matthews and nylander
leafs,lxu8nct,2024-11-18 18:28:46,Coool story brooooo willy was terrible in game 7 he just scored a goal lol take that goal away and he was trash jt and knies matthew and marner all out played him
leafs,lxu9h6d,2024-11-18 18:33:33,Matthews is a beast. Been watching the Leafs since Sittler/McDonald/Salming/Turnbull/Palmateer days. In alll those years Ive never seen a TML have the most goals in the league. Win major trophies like the Hart/Lindsay regarded as a top 5 player in the worldand best goal scorer. Then came #34.
leafs,lxtmf4i,2024-11-18 16:29:12,You’re not wrong though would be a lot harder to make it all time MT Rushmore. Mats is still there for me. Matthews will be if not yet. The other 2 are up for grabs
leafs,lxu0jc6,2024-11-18 17:42:51,Nah. Because in 50 years no one will care about either. A loss is a loss.

leafs,lxu53j5,2024-11-18 18:08:14,He will make $12m soon enough.  His point total is bolstered by racking up assists in blowouts. Matthews sucks in the playoffs too (for what he is paid). Nylander is a stud. Look at this goal totals the last 5 playoffs.
leafs,lxu11j1,2024-11-18 17:45:37,Then you're saying we shouldn't have a Mt. Rushmore for losers at all. That's closer to my opinion than I think you realize.
leafs,lxu5cyb,2024-11-18 18:09:44,Yea it is. Because you are dead set on hating a player and want to cherry pick stats to make him look bad instead of viewing it as a whole which tells the truth. He's been good to very good in the playoffs but he hasn't been great and unfortunately that's what we need from him and the other 2 because of the contracts.
leafs,lxu5jco,2024-11-18 18:10:46,Matthews has more playoff goals and points than nylander but suddenly he sucks too? Lol okay.    Also you don't k ow what marner will make none of us do or if it will even be with the leafs. Stop creating reasons to hate him.
leafs,lxu22me,2024-11-18 17:51:13,Nope. A mt Rushmore is just the greatest players. No way in hell is Murray better than Luongo just because he had playoff success.
leafs,lxu5qfx,2024-11-18 18:11:54,"Because it's not cherry picking. It's giving the stats context. The way you're looking at it he could have 1 4 point game and 0 points in 3 other games and you'd still go ""he's a point a game!"""
leafs,lxu7kg9,2024-11-18 18:22:30,Nylander has more goals in less games in the previous five playoffs. Yes Matthews sucks in the playoffs for what he is paid. Go look at how other superstars produce. It’s an absolute joke he gets a pass. Marner will get paid. He is a regular season stud. This isn’t some wild speculation. It’s practically a guarantee.
leafs,lxu68xw,2024-11-18 18:14:51,And if those 4 points helped win the game then it doesn't make them any less valuable.

leafs,lxsrfas,2024-11-18 13:52:49,Might be one of the most divisive designs I've done considering the comments already but allow me to explain the design for those who may be unfamiliar.These uniforms are based on the Toronto Arenas 1918 uniforms as well as the late 1920s Leafs uniforms. However the Arenas never had a white uniform so I thought it would be fun to make one as a throwback / winter classic design.I understand that the vintage look isn't for everyone but I personally love it.

leafs,lxsq88b,2024-11-18 13:46:55,I would love these! Really great concept design here!!! I’m still waiting for the leafs to do a 1934 throwback I love the white jersey they had with the lines across the upper chest
leafs,lxstq4x,2024-11-18 14:04:20,Why the baby shit coloured pants man Edm already does it and they look terrible
leafs,lxsow79,2024-11-18 13:40:12,I love these! Love the squared off shoulder yoke.
leafs,lxt9jv9,2024-11-18 15:24:26,Maybe swap from diarrhea brown to a more caramel brown. 
leafs,lxte24f,2024-11-18 15:47:16,No bad ideas. But… Back to the drawing board
leafs,lxthd0z,2024-11-18 16:03:47,I like the name plate!
leafs,lxtjuq0,2024-11-18 16:16:17,this is beautiful classiccould do without the brown and replace the T with the actual logo but the jersey design itself is much preferable to the boring one now imo

leafs,lxu7r78,2024-11-18 18:23:35,I like it - I'd likely reduce the blue stripes to 2 each limb and I'd get away from the brown (I know retro look but meh) - I do like the leaf with the letters in it
leafs,lxuasng,2024-11-18 18:41:14,I like it. I think people get way too serious and picky about the leafs jerseys. These are a cool winter classic design that pay homage to the arenas logo
leafs,lxuassg,2024-11-18 18:41:15,I personally love the brown. I think there could be a little more blue but otherwise I actually really dig it!

leafs,lxt3jh3,2024-11-18 14:53:41,Too plain also looks like University of Toronto Varsity Blues. Also we are a hockey team not a baseball team.

leafs,lxtj9b7,2024-11-18 16:13:19,Love the effort. I'm here for any discussion about Leafs alt uniforms because I find that stuff really interesting. I like thoughtful inclusion of brown too.For me the T logo from the Arenas concept just doesn't work. The Maple Leafs should have a Leaf.

leafs,lxsu7af,2024-11-18 14:06:43,I don’t think it’s as bad as people are making it out to be but I can see why it’s not for everyone. I’m a sucker for “retro” designs so I kinda like it for some reason. I’ve been hoping for a new alternate jersey design based on the Sittler era shoulder stripe jerseys but with the current leaf logo. I’d be curious to see what that would look like with these brown pants. I think the Arenas jersey they did already was pretty nice for what it was.
leafs,lxt9o7z,2024-11-18 15:25:04,I was gonna say they looked familiar!! I actually quite like the vintage design. My jersey is the vintage maple leaf.You did well

leafs,lxs67kn,2024-11-18 12:06:25,He was concussed during the playoffs last year was he not? Hopefully he’s not having post concussion symptoms. Luckily they are in a position where they can be patient.
leafs,lxs82xj,2024-11-18 12:15:55,welp sad that I won't see him when I go Wednesday \*but\* this just means that there's a greater chance I get to see Marner doing his thang and scoring again
leafs,lxsahmn,2024-11-18 12:28:01,We only have one game this week and only three games in the next two weeks might as well just give him another week or two to fully recover rather than rushing him back
leafs,lxsgv9b,2024-11-18 12:59:47,I'm really hoping as a candadian and as a leaf fan the team doesn't allow him to play I'm the 4 nations cup. Would be really leafy for him to get hurt while playing for usa. With him missing this many games it shouldn't even be on option 
leafs,lxs9vhh,2024-11-18 12:24:55,I’m all for skipping Vegas. Gives him nothing to do but recover. Not a lot of games for our leafs next couple weeks may as well take advantage of it
leafs,lxsdd2x,2024-11-18 12:42:22,We only have four games left in November. Keep him off for the next two weeks and hopefully by December he’s ready to roll. Lots of season left.
leafs,lxsl1jp,2024-11-18 13:20:53,Not saying Matthews is the problem but we’ve been doing so good without him. I say we stop focusing too much on him and give others a chance. Mcmann has stepped up in ways I can’t even explain. I know there are other players who can do the same too given the chance. Break the core 4 into different groups- then you’ll have 4 powerful lines.
leafs,lxsofs9,2024-11-18 13:37:54,He looked injured since the beginning of the season. He was always tired and few times he would limp during a shift.

leafs,lxs31mw,2024-11-18 11:50:20,Honestly the team is doing ok without him so I don't care if he's out another month. Rack up the LTIR cap space so they can load up at the deadline.
leafs,lxs8fo2,2024-11-18 12:17:42,I'm betting it's not an injury but a sickness; I bet the poor fucker developed Crohns or Colitis and they're struggling to figure out a med routine still.It would explain why he looked like shit in the playoffs but wasn't isolated from the team for being sick and why he's off for so long now without anything but vague details; no one wants to advertise that they're shitting blood 14 times a day.
leafs,lxs984w,2024-11-18 12:21:42,We have 4 games left in November.  Vegas Utah Panthers and Lightning.  None of them are on back to backs and while the Panthers/Tampa are division games this is a great opportunity to give an extended rest.  It seems unlikely he plays this month if he isn't skating.

leafs,lxsh6ax,2024-11-18 13:01:20,The secrecy I get. That’s how they handle everything. “He’s not getting worse” is what’s scary. What even has the possibility of getting worse even when you’re doing nothing? Really really hope he isn’t struggling with a Toews style post-Covid thing. Because he also looked off before he started resting. Getting gassed and giving up on plays in ways that were unlike him.
leafs,lxsjfzn,2024-11-18 13:12:52,He won’t be back until December. I’m not holding my breath for anything before then.On a funny note I had a dream on the weekend his injury was related to a botched hair transplant… not that I think he needs one but yah ..

leafs,lxsmnm5,2024-11-18 13:28:56,The upper body report fits weird with this considering he isn't even skating.Have to assume concussion or possibly back related (he has taken some nasty cross checks to the back over the years)

leafs,lxs4kb8,2024-11-18 11:58:00,I've heard these kinds of things can take the whole regular season to heal properly.  We may have to use the cap space to get orielly back. 
leafs,lxsb1bp,2024-11-18 12:30:45,So whats wrong with him
leafs,lxsdrpj,2024-11-18 12:44:23,Anybody got a tinfoil hat to join me?I think they might milk this situation to have a plausible reason to put him on LTIR later in the season and finally use the same loophole other winners used.
leafs,lxs54s2,2024-11-18 12:00:54,I have no clue why anyone gives a shit. He's injured let him sit out as long as he needs to. We're winning without him. Regular season doesn't matter. Very simple.
leafs,lxs8pe9,2024-11-18 12:19:04,So Matthews was the problem
leafs,lxsitnz,2024-11-18 13:09:42,Well he doesn't seem to be getting better either so that's worrisome. We're another injury or two from getting spread pretty thin.
leafs,lxsk25n,2024-11-18 13:15:58,Well then truthfully Matthews couldn’t get any worse so Berube was telling the truth. Theory checks out.

leafs,lxs5lji,2024-11-18 12:03:18,Everyone is secretive now. Nurse left the game on sat with an upper body injury. It was pretty obvious why he leftMatthews wrist issues have always been upper body as well.But I think you're right about the concussion. Cause he missed a couple games skated 2 days on his own now hasn't done anything for a week. Sure sounds like a concussion
leafs,lxs5iwl,2024-11-18 12:02:55,Is there anything to suggest what it could be ?
leafs,lxs5myq,2024-11-18 12:03:30,Yes along with the uncertainty of the healing.
leafs,lxsbtg5,2024-11-18 12:34:40,They’re always secretive about injuries. Nothing new here.
leafs,lxt5g93,2024-11-18 15:03:20,I think secrecy around injuries with Toronto especially Matthews aren’t odd in fact it’s the norm the last few years
leafs,lxtqoap,2024-11-18 16:50:46,I can't remember which insider it was but they said Matthews is very private about his health. They alluded to when Steve Simmons leaked that Matthews had covid and how Matthews was rather annoyed about it and called it unethical.
leafs,lxs9z4q,2024-11-18 12:25:25,"Hey I'm going Wednesday too! Second game of the ""Matthews Era"" and he didn't play last time either!"
leafs,lxu0w6t,2024-11-18 17:44:47,It’s in February. If he’s healthy he’s definitely going to play lol.
leafs,lxshryd,2024-11-18 13:04:23,Specifically by December 10th when I’m supposed to see them.
leafs,lxs6osx,2024-11-18 12:08:52,they also aren't accruing any cap space because we're over in LTIR
leafs,lxs6wz1,2024-11-18 12:10:02,I don't think you can accrue LTIR cap space only regular cap space which we currently are since we're not at the ceiling but only by a small amount. Could be wrong on that though.
leafs,lxs89rd,2024-11-18 12:16:53,Thats not how LTIR works. You dont save cap for the deadline via injury. You only save cap for the deadline by having unused cap space that builds up.
leafs,lxs6cij,2024-11-18 12:07:08,lol sure until they lose 2 games in a row and everyone is panicking
leafs,lxsarjz,2024-11-18 12:29:24,Wild speculation but i agree. The mystery shrouding the situation and circumstances could certainly point to some sort of illness like this as opposed to physical ailment
leafs,lxsk4h8,2024-11-18 13:16:17,I can see December as well. They only have like 4 games left this month so I would hold off until then.
leafs,lxs46pm,2024-11-18 11:56:06,Given he’s not even skating I’d guess that’s a no.
leafs,lxs6uzm,2024-11-18 12:09:45,quote was fairly obvious on this point.  holding (means not getting better) but not getting worse
leafs,lxshl03,2024-11-18 13:03:24,“I have no clue why fans care about watching the best player their franchise has ever had.”
leafs,lxsd6rp,2024-11-18 12:41:30,Honestly? Yes. We defer to him way too much and when he's not lighting the world on fire we struggle. With him out players have had to step up. Tavares and Marner have been excellent with Marner rediscovering that he is in fact capable of shooting the puck. For Marner he looks like a different and more confidant player.When Matthews comes back I hope they keep on winning but who knows. Aside from our eventual destination the Leafs like to be unpredictable along the way.
leafs,lxtx1y9,2024-11-18 17:24:10,Its arguable that the best hockey we played in the playoffs was while he was gone lol
leafs,lxtcxyy,2024-11-18 15:41:40,Debatable we don’t know if we’d have lost those games with him on the ice and there’s no denying his talent However it is clear that players step up more when he’s not around to save them The team has to find a way to reconcile that
leafs,lxsjcyf,2024-11-18 13:12:26,Seriously the injuries he's had have always been lingering and he seems to heal quite slowly but i'm no doctor.
leafs,lxs7trj,2024-11-18 12:14:39,I'd think concussion or migraine issue
leafs,lxs83kq,2024-11-18 12:16:01,i think on the last Leafs Report Mirtle seemed very confident it wasn't his wrist. They didn't know what it was but said it wasn't that. They said maybe his back as a result of how he contorts/shoots.Remember he hurt himself in pre-season and I am assuming it's a lingering effect from then.
leafs,lxsk90l,2024-11-18 13:16:55,I said this last week and was downvoted into oblivion.   There's two things that can cause you to stay off the ice...back issues (which he does have some history of) and concussion issues.
leafs,lxs7ayo,2024-11-18 12:12:01,They said it wasn't his wrist and he isn't skating. Upper body is pretty limited but not even skating seems to imply head or neck. Pure speculation though.
leafs,lxu39w0,2024-11-18 17:57:52,Yeaa but here's to hoping th eleafs don't let him
leafs,lxsa6ga,2024-11-18 12:26:27,Can you explain why they put players on IR at all or even after the fact? Is it only for roster spot management not cap management?For example what benefit does putting Matthews on IR when we already are a the limit for LTIR space?Why did they originally retroactively put Matthews on IR mid week after he missed the Sunday game against the Wild? If cap space isn't affected what was the need to place him the few days earlier after the fact?Would love to be more solid on my understanding of this
leafs,lxs7cnk,2024-11-18 12:12:15,If people are still panicking I don't know what to tell them. The regular season is just 82 hoops to jump through
leafs,lxsfd85,2024-11-18 12:52:19,Marner's scored 30+ each of the last 3 years (last year prorated for injury). I know he's a pass first guy but it's not like this is some aberration
leafs,lxsdcsg,2024-11-18 12:42:20,So it’s not Matthews that’s the problem but the other players is what you’re saying.
leafs,lxsq5zd,2024-11-18 13:46:36,> Marner rediscovering that he is in fact capable of shooting the puck. For Marner he looks like a different and more confidant player.This is why I have always and will always argue that Matthews Nylander Marner should all be on separate lines. They are all paid to drive a line themselves it's time we have them do it consistently.
leafs,lxsq7r7,2024-11-18 13:46:52,"Ya this ""marner never shoots"" narrative really neesd to stop. First of all he's a play maker and an amazing one at that. so of course he's going to pass more than he shoots.DESPITE THAT the guy literally only has 29 less career goals than Nylander and has played 27 less games on top of it."
leafs,lxsdw8r,2024-11-18 12:45:01,You will get downvoted for this but it’s true individual players are over rated in hockey. It’s the ultimate team game. That’s why it makes no sense to pay 4 guys half the cap.
leafs,lxsdhka,2024-11-18 12:42:58,Matthews just doing his part to ensure Mitch gets the bag he's aiming for 
leafs,lxt671u,2024-11-18 15:07:11,It's this.  He's a great player but they try to make him *the* player.He needs to be a member of the team but not the team.
leafs,lxte2qf,2024-11-18 15:47:21,they're always so secretive about his injuries aswell
leafs,lxs81xl,2024-11-18 12:15:47,Could be his back IIRC he’s had back issues in the past. 
leafs,lxs7rmt,2024-11-18 12:14:21,I'm leaning on you being closer than not. I remember someone saying he got more physical in a scrum than usual but I skimmed back a few games and didn't notice anything telling.
leafs,lxshb48,2024-11-18 13:02:01,Im wondering if its his back
leafs,lxsca8i,2024-11-18 12:37:00,IR opens up a roster spot of which each team has 23. The players full cap still applies.LTIR opens up a roster spot **and** allows the team to spend over the cap by the amount that player makes. Its a pretty common misconception that LTIR makes a caphit disappear but in reality you actually are allowed to spend over the cap by their number. So for example if Matthews 13.25 million was on LTIR then the Leafs dont go from 88 million spent on the cap down to 74.75 million. They go from being allowed to spend 88 million to 101.25 million as long as he remains on LTIR. Thats why they dont accrue space they arent under the 88 million limit they are just allowed to exceed it. Only unspent money under the cap ceiling accrues to be used at the deadline. And as for why Matthews wasnt immediately on IR its likely because they werent sure how long he would miss. You have to stay on IR for a minimum 7 days so if there was a chance he could return earlier they didnt want to close the door on it. Once it became obvious he wouldnt be back within 7 days they IR him (which is automatically retroactive to his last game played) to have more roster flexibility and able to call someone up. He can now be activated whenever he is healthy since the minimum 7 days have passed.
leafs,lxsco34,2024-11-18 12:38:55,Your assumption is correct. Putting somebody on IR is simply for roster management it has no bearing on the cap. Retroactively putting somebody on IR allows them to re-activate the player sooner.
leafs,lxsgymk,2024-11-18 13:00:15,It's both. The players defer to him too much and if Matthews isn't playing at 100% we struggle. Even if Matthews is healthy and playing the way he can it's still a somewhat neutered version of the team. Why can't Matthews light up the first line while we get these current versions of Marner and Tavares torching the second line? It would be magical.
leafs,lxsnqnm,2024-11-18 13:34:23,And even less to load them on the same linesRoll 3 lines with Matthews Marner and Nylander all separated and they'll create plays on their own. We have enough complementary players to make it work if we can get a decent 3C
leafs,lxs98vv,2024-11-18 12:21:48,Good point. Would also align with them not having a concrete timeline too.
leafs,lxsqpor,2024-11-18 13:49:20,> Why can't Matthews light up the first line while we get these current versions of Marner and Tavares torching the second line? It would be magical.Because Matthews and Marner are the best defensive forwards on the team and it's not even close. Why would you make your top line weaker in offense and defensive ability just to make the second (potentially) a little better?I don't know why we aren't acting like Matthews didn't just almost score 70 goals last year with Marner feeding him the whole time as well.
leafs,lxsmtt8,2024-11-18 13:29:48,I think you’re just confusing yourself here. So it’s not Matthews it’s the other guys. They are the ones that change when Auston is present.
leafs,lxt0q3k,2024-11-18 14:39:26,we can't have Marner and Tavares torching the second line because for some reason Marner has to keep playing with Matthews (coach / management decision)
leafs,lxtdb4p,2024-11-18 15:43:29,He was pretty good with Domi Kinda seems like they could pair him with Domi (who could use the help) And let Marner continue to light it up on his own
leafs,lxt9ix0,2024-11-18 15:24:18,Marner and Matthews have been one of the most productive effective duos in the league for years
leafs,lxrzmlz,2024-11-18 11:33:01,Well at least we don’t have to worry about the cap space I guess lol
leafs,lxs0e4p,2024-11-18 11:36:54,Hopefully he can be back by the playoffs. This team really needs depth and there are just so many assets you can trade at the deadline.

leafs,lxs1afc,2024-11-18 11:41:28,Owie!
leafs,lxsdav6,2024-11-18 12:42:04,He should go to Shouldice Hernia Hospital in Thornhill. He would be ready to play in 3 to 4 weeks.
leafs,lxsmr07,2024-11-18 13:29:24,Damn so the speculation was right. It WAS a sports hernia.I dunno how many people will agree with me but that's a blow. Jarnkrok isn't the best on the team but he's a reliable player that brings a lot of flexibility. Having someone you can slot into any position and expect a decent performance... the Leafs could really use that.
leafs,lxsgj5w,2024-11-18 12:58:06,Any doctors in the chat? Just curious why this is coming up in late November rather than the summer. Just the way it goes or did Leafs medical miss something here?
leafs,lxs2nb8,2024-11-18 11:48:20,sucks Leafs would love to have him in the lineup right now.  Wonder if the team gives Alex Nylander a shot up given all the people missing + Reaves out
leafs,lxs13e8,2024-11-18 11:40:30,Just in time for playoffs

leafs,lxs0i78,2024-11-18 11:37:29,Sad that Jarny is going to be gone for most of the season if not the entire thing. Also puts a damper into my accruing cap space plans.
leafs,lxs5c0m,2024-11-18 12:01:56,That's what I'm thinking. Just having him as a 4th liner in the playoffs would be a nice boost.

leafs,lxsbazh,2024-11-18 12:32:06,Does he go to the same doctor as Mark Stone? 
leafs,lxs3x7l,2024-11-18 11:54:46,I think Grebby has been much better so far less of a liability on defense lays the body big which Berube likes. Waiver exempt as well and producing in the AHL really well. That being said I think Steeves is still up so I don't think they need anyone else yet Steeves/Robertson have been cycling scratches with Reaves in
leafs,lxs413k,2024-11-18 11:55:19,Would be interesting to see but the leafs would have to sign him first and that might lead to more roster issues later on. His stat line looks ok in the A but I’m not sure if it’s enough for the leafs to use the roster spot on him though.  I’m wondering if we see Minten get a chance given the need for a depth center and how good he looked before his injury.
leafs,lxtaqwk,2024-11-18 15:30:32,I've had a hernia similar to that. Not fun but the recovery was pretty quick. I was back to pretty much 100% in a month.
leafs,lxs1b57,2024-11-18 11:41:34,Why? He’s better than half our forward group
leafs,lxs1w7i,2024-11-18 11:44:32,>accruing cap space plansThat was never going to happen this year.
leafs,lxs9rs3,2024-11-18 12:24:24,Sure but this probably puts him into gone for the year or postseason acquisition.  So while we don't accrue cap space we do get to use his 2.1M in cap space all year and might have a nice depth piece in the postseason if he is healthy enough to play.
leafs,lxscmpz,2024-11-18 12:38:43,I thought Metamucil was the opposite of a stool softener
leafs,lxs2em3,2024-11-18 11:47:07,Lupul was better than the majority of the forwards we had at the time too but couldn’t stay healthy. Do you understand the concept of Robidas island? I think it’s a bit too early to put Calle on the island. Having said that he’s had multiple injuries now and he is 33 years old so you never know!
leafs,lxsatd9,2024-11-18 12:29:39,I’m curious why you think this. You can construct a 22 man roster with 3.3M in cap space if you trade David Kampf. Accrue that to the trade deadline and that’s enough to bring in a significant piece to parlay 3C. If they can’t bring in a piece they can payout Pacioretty’s bonuses against this year’s cap. David Kampf is a fine piece but he’s not worth 2.4M and there are replacement pieces already on the roster for a 4C in Dewar and Lorentz. His FO% is a bit better but hardly worth 2-3x cost. You would already have Dewar Lorentz Marner Knies McMann and Holmberg as PKers.
leafs,lxsbrau,2024-11-18 12:34:23,The old Mark Stone. I don’t disagree with it. I think the biggest need for the Leafs is a 3rd line center right shot who is good at faceoffs. -shrug-  I haven’t investigated who or what’s available but that’s certainly on my wishlist.
leafs,lxses87,2024-11-18 12:49:25,The fiber to make it move and the softener to make it come out easier.The handles for your toilet seat: Priceless
leafs,lxsh7gs,2024-11-18 13:01:30,Sir you are correct. I meant Ducolax...it's been a while
leafs,lxs31qf,2024-11-18 11:50:21,I think I’m the only one who does understand the concept here lolRobidas island is where you force guys who are washed and have cap hits you want to get rid of. Has nothing to do with Jarnkrok who isn’t washed and who the leafs could really use right now
leafs,lxsf52u,2024-11-18 12:51:11,The only problem with this logic is if we’re saying he’s not worth 2.4m on a contending team who in the league is going to take a multi-year contract for a 4C valued at 2.4aav off our books? He has 2 more years after this season still with a 10 team no trade list thru 2025/26 season.
leafs,lxtm6a6,2024-11-18 16:27:58,"It's difficult to do when any injury cuts into the ability to accrue cap. If Jarnkrok was healthy today they've already spent 20% of the season on LTIR not accruing space. So now ""if"" they can clear $3.3M by running a 22-man roster you then have to take out the salary for the Matthews/Pacioretty replacements. To accrue any significant amount of money the team needs a significant amount of luck when it comes to injuries which has not been the case this year."
leafs,lxs5c76,2024-11-18 12:01:58,As long as they’re also injured yea. Robidas himself had shoulder surgery (among other things) which he couldn’t come back from. Lupul had back problems and a sports hernia on top of having knee surgery just a year prior to having another “lower body injury”. Dude couldn’t get healthy. He even tried to get back but failed a physical multiple times. We know what happened to Jake Muzzin.There’s always a likely career ending injury which lands people on Robidas Island. The LTIR cap stuff is the bonus we get to enjoy.We aren’t just putting people on career ending LTIR because they’re bad and have high cap hits lol.
leafs,lxs5au6,2024-11-18 12:01:46,And they could also just use that cap hit to go get another winger whose ability’s start with availability. Thinking he is ever going to be a regular everyday dependable winger again is lunacy.
leafs,lxskd6n,2024-11-18 13:17:30,Dubas seemed to like him so maybe he can be a cap exchange piece in an O'Connor trade. We have some prospects that were drafted by Dubas that he may be interested in getting back and for a rebuilding team some draft picks thrown in are always valuable. We don't have many but we have some future picks we can move in a deal like that which for a team like Pittsburgh will be good to have.
leafs,lxswp5u,2024-11-18 14:19:11,How in the hell does someone of jarnkrok's caliber have any kind of trade protection?That is insanity from dubas
leafs,lxt57al,2024-11-18 15:02:03,Basically every multi-year deal Dubas signed had some sort of trade protection. I don't necessarily think it was a Dubas thing though but an organizational thing because it's also happened since Treliving took over. Kämpf Domi OEL Stolarz Woll all got some form of trade protection on their current deals.

leafs,lxqzi4o,2024-11-18 07:58:29,As much as that game sucked and hurt there was still hope because we were supposed to be swept by the Bruins that season.   I’d argue that the series loss to Montreal when up 3 games to 1 was the most horrific collapse of all time.   That series loss is still carried by this team.
leafs,lxsu10v,2024-11-18 14:05:51,There was a small party at my apartment in NYC drinking that day I was the only one watching the game. When Boston won it I threw an empty beer can at the TV and literally just went to bed and was actually angry. I’ve never felt like that about a sport I wasn’t actually playing before or since. That was one of the biggest chokes I’ve ever seen other than the Falcons blowing that Super Bowl lead. The Leafs would have lost in Round two but blowing that game as pro athletes was unreal. The loss to Montreal was ducking absurd but I give that the Covid pass my a bit. And they just couldn’t beat Price.

leafs,lxrjofq,2024-11-18 10:07:20,I watch it every now and then the highlights don't do it justice imo. They were literally still up 4-2  with like 1:40 left. Blowing that in the regular season would be painful enough nvmd game 7 vs Boston.
leafs,lxrmkmf,2024-11-18 10:23:40,It was the other way around was it not? They were losing 5-1? 5-0?

leafs,lxr77z4,2024-11-18 08:51:22,Yeah I agree. We had zero cup aspirations in 2013. Who cares about 4-1. Montreal loss comeback is another level of embarrassing in my opinion.

Every clip of play seems to have him hitting someone. Picture perfect Berube player. We've needed a Russian psycho on this team for a long time now. Our last few were too nice.Also Alex Nylander with an absolutely filthy snipe in OT. Would be nice to see him get a two way this offseason and keep the brothers together in the organization
leafs,lxrrb1d,2024-11-18 10:49:15,Friedman predicts the cap surging next offseason to $94M-$97M rather than the $92M previously reported because of escrow relief and appetite from the players.Also says he can see the cap sniffing $110M in two years as well.If that’s truly the case offer Marner anything less than Matthews and sign Knies to a wealthy (in today’s terms and cap) extension to 8 years knowing the cap is skyrocketing.I’m saying this as a fan who has soured on Marner’s because of the contract situation.
leafs,lxrb9cv,2024-11-18 09:17:09,I was curious yesterday how many times do the Leafs play a team that’s on the second half of a back to back since they already have played 5 back to backs and haven’t caught a team on one yet and with Montreal Ottawa Buffalo and so on all being so close you would think they would have played at least one team on one by now.The TLDR is they play 13 games this year where the team plays the night before and in 4 of them the Leafs also play the day before.Full breakdown of games for anyone curious (Team dates and travel)Utah Nov 23-24 Pittsburgh to Toronto Tampa Nov 29-30 Nashville to Tampa (first game is at 3pm second at 7pm)Chicago Dec 1-2 Chicago to Toronto (first game at 3pm the second at 7:30) Pittsburgh Dec 6-7 New York to Pittsburgh (Leafs also play day before in Toronto)Anaheim Dec 11-12 Ottawa to Toronto Buffalo Dec 15-16 Washington to Buffalo (Leafs play night before in Detroit)Vancouver Jan 10-11 Carolina to Toronto Chicago Feb 22-23 Columbus to Chicago (Leafs play in Toronto night before)Pittsburgh Mar 1-2 both in Pittsburgh Florida April 1-2 Montreal to Toronto Montreal April 11-12 Ottawa to Toronto Carolina April 12-13 Both in Carolina (Leafs play in Toronto night before and Carolina first game starts at 3pm Toronto’s first at 7pm and second game starts at 5pm)Detroit April 16-17 New Jersey to Toronto(Also not meant as a excuse was just generally curious)

It doesn't matter that everybody knows it. That's where they stand and shoot from. There's no good reason to not do the same with Matthews.  Well other than Marc Savard being a turd

leafs,lxt4etr,2024-11-18 14:58:06,I'd love for Ovi to get to 893 goals then be physically unable to score another for the rest of his career.Like a magical force prevents it. EBUGs stand on their heads against him sticks explode He whiffs on open nets goals are called back due to GI or offsides. The puck stops ON the line during EN situations. Teammates tap in pucks that were trickling in anyways behind the goalie.It'd make for great entertainment.

My wishlist probably-not-going-to-happen move would be Zegras. Him with Marner and Robertson would mean one of Matthews Marner or Nylander is on the ice almost all the time.
leafs,lxrii6p,2024-11-18 10:00:37,How is it that mcdavid is back from what the media reported was a “serious lower body injury” after missing only a week and 3 games but Matthews is up to 2 weeks and 6 games with what Burube himself called a “minor upper body injury”? Real Kyler and Bourne had a damned doctor on their show saying that  Mcdavid could require surgery.

leafs,lxrsy1t,2024-11-18 10:57:56,Karma hoarders. Fake fans.
leafs,lxu5duu,2024-11-18 18:09:53,An Edmonton fan on one of their posts regarding the Reaves hit said that this suspension makes the Leafs better and that a proper punishment would be for the league to make Reaves play 20 minutes per game for the next 5 games. LOL.
leafs,lxrusf3,2024-11-18 11:07:43,I don't think the hit was malicious. I don't think Reaves is a dirty player or a bad person whatsoever.I think we have better hockey players in the organization that can better help contribute to the team's success. Icing a goon that does nothing else in 2024 is incredibly stupid IMO. If you absolutely must have a knuckle duster then sure get someone in there who will fight when needed Just make sure they can also play hockey and don't need knee braces just to skate.Like what are we doing here?
leafs,lxti8qz,2024-11-18 16:08:14,Hey I'll help you out and shit on reaves in this thread as well. He's a plug whose only redeaming qualities is fighting and he doesn't even do that. He's a net negative on this team and takes up a spot for younger players to develop. He has looked horrible this year.
leafs,lxs6wah,2024-11-18 12:09:56,If it’s legit that it goes up to $97M? Yeahhhh that makes a Marner extension a lot more palatable. Especially after Nashville showed what big free agency spending can do. We’d still have money left over afterwards to frig about in free agency if I’m not mistaken (though I’d have to do the math). Just would be more “target a specific need” rather then “shopping spree” kind of money.
leafs,lxtsrg1,2024-11-18 17:01:24,Running it back isn’t going to work regardless of the cap changing.
leafs,lxt25sl,2024-11-18 14:46:42,Yup and teams will be more willing to take on willys deal. We could really set ourselves up for a long time with some shrewd dealing.
leafs,lxrwl5z,2024-11-18 11:17:11,I was curious so i looked it up and there isnt a single flight here that is longer than 2 hours. All are within 1h - 1h45mNSH-TBL might be the longest one.
leafs,lxt80w8,2024-11-18 15:16:37,There was a whole post about this a few days back with charts/graphs if you’re interested.
leafs,lxsrhmw,2024-11-18 13:53:09,Matthews dies not have the same one timmer as them
leafs,lxthjjd,2024-11-18 16:04:42,Conflict of interest...how? They aren't saying you have to give positive answers they just want to incentivize answers to the survey
leafs,lxtryww,2024-11-18 16:57:20,A young 2C is going to be very hard to find through trade. You’re always paying more for potential in the trade then stuck hoping you can get that out of them. I think the 3C is the spot to fill at least this year. I’ve been liking is Nick Bjugstad on Utah. 6’6 plays the body and can contribute a fair bit offensively. Expiring contract and he’s on Arizona. Doesn’t have much playoff experience but seems like a perfect fit otherwise.
leafs,lxtwgzl,2024-11-18 17:21:02,Morgan Frost is the guy to target IMO he’s fallen out of favour in Philly. He was in a similar situation as Liljegren was with the Leafs. A former 1st round pick who’s shown glimpses of being a top of the lineup contributor. I’d offer a similar package and I’m fairly sure it’d be something they’d seriously consider.Knies - Matthews - Domi Pacioretty - Frost - MarnerMcMann - Tavares - NylanderDewar - Kampf - Lorentz You could legitimately run three lines in waves and overwhelm opposing teams and the fourth line would be a solid shutdown/checking line as well.
leafs,lxtoj3u,2024-11-18 16:39:55,I would love to know that too. It's so tough to figure out where to start to look. Glad I'm not a GM
leafs,lxt1szi,2024-11-18 14:44:54,Zebras is the exact opposite type of player we need.All flash no substance.Like willy.
leafs,lxrk6xk,2024-11-18 10:10:16,Everything medical aside we're 2nd in the division and one point back of first they're 5th in theirs. They need McDavid back we have more of the luxury to rest Matthews until he's 100%.
leafs,lxrjezw,2024-11-18 10:05:52,from 10000 feet....the mcdavid report came out the next day. anybody who's had a sprain know the amount of swelling and stuff in the first 24 hours is so much you really can't see the damage and make an accurate assessment.  IMO...they shouldnt have made that forecast for him....but media was pressing best player in the world and all.with matthews... literally nobody knows what it is...so anything anybody is saying is speculation.  if this is a minor thing nagging him... berube isnt wrong...but he also can't say how long it'll nag him for. its clearly still there...leafs are on a run....no need to rush back.  if they were 2-8 in the last 10 vs 8-2.... i think he'd be on the ice.
leafs,lxrzw7w,2024-11-18 11:34:23,Did you miss the part where Matthews was already playing injured? He got hurt in pre-season and played through it and presumably made his injury worse or at least prevented recovery Stupid to bring him back too early when the team is still winning and when he already tried to play through this and it didn’t get better
leafs,lxrlen1,2024-11-18 10:17:07,I was just thinking this am as we’re 40-20-2 without Matthews: the poor lads missed almost an entire season so far in his career.  Factor in Covid shutdown too and he’s lost like 2 seasons of points potential.    But man I didn’t really think it’s been 62 games of injury time so far.  Damn.
leafs,lxs0ch6,2024-11-18 11:36:40,He’s far from a goon mate
leafs,lxtgo51,2024-11-18 16:00:18,What exactly did Nashville show? Pretty sure they are scraping near the bottom of the league
leafs,lxtg0bl,2024-11-18 15:56:59,It's crazy that you're a top 1% commenter almost exclusively shitting on Nylander.  What a hobby.
leafs,lxtww1i,2024-11-18 17:23:18,Whyd you say that in a Scottish accent?
leafs,lxtmn4o,2024-11-18 16:30:19,Oh no the WIN A TRIP thing is not what I'm concerned about.But isn't it weird that Qualtrics that belongs to the owner of Utah HC is hired by the NHL to collect feedback from the fans? Whatever the NHL will get out of this survey Qualtrics will as well. I might be overthinking the whole thing tbh.
leafs,lxth1b9,2024-11-18 16:02:08,Yeah you're right. Goons fight. He barely even does that anymore.No but seriously. All due respect but you're out to lunch.. mateI can't fathom that people seriously think Ryan fucking Reaves is an adequate NHL player worth a spot over someone who can still play hockey.
leafs,lxu99fn,2024-11-18 18:32:17,That’s not the argument. I agree with you- many better players. But he’s not a goon. Anyway moving on.
leafs,lxp3j0x,2024-11-17 21:48:25,Argos and Leafs just dominate Winnipeg.. enjoy the 10 inches of snow next week Winnipeg
leafs,lxpdzxq,2024-11-17 22:57:26,Hey Winnipeg has nothing to do with this post and Saskatchewan will be getting that snow first. Also 10 centimeters expected here. Quite a bit less than 10 inches bud. 
leafs,lxof228,2024-11-17 19:19:54,Akhthamov looks to be filthy honestly really really promising start so far
leafs,lxofgzu,2024-11-17 19:22:15,It's funny that Murray and Ullmark are from the same draft. Murray won two cups and descended to a fifth ranked goalie on a different team by the time Ullmark finally got his big payday and becomes a clear number one
leafs,lxofg5w,2024-11-17 19:22:07,Let Murray be the extra guy in net at practice and that’s it at this point. Let Hildeby and Akhtyamov get as many starts as possible now.
leafs,lxryd3j,2024-11-18 11:26:28,Leafs are a bit of a goalie factory now eh?I just hope Big bad Brad doesn't pull a Rask and ship one out until we have a clear and definitive best next option at the NHL level.
leafs,lxoo5iw,2024-11-17 20:13:35,This is the goalie I'm excited about. Leafs haven't had a promising G prospect like this since Rask. Woll and hildeby are great too... i see them peaking as potential capable starters but more likely a really reliable solid backup.
leafs,lxq4ewq,2024-11-18 02:46:49,King Artur
leafs,lxqih86,2024-11-18 05:23:35,All in all this - to me - is the most important news about our team.  We have solid goaltending at NHL level right now and more at AHL level.  For all the warts the Leafs have goaltending is the single position that can make the biggest difference... and where we've been lacking for so many years nowGLG!
leafs,lxr0iuu,2024-11-18 08:05:56,Since he looks so promising and we have a two time cup winning goalie and Hildeby waiting in the wings we should trade him at the draft for a Raycroft-type…. What could go wrong??
leafs,lxoivnj,2024-11-17 19:41:50,A .926 is disgusting. Unhygienic as if he doesn’t bathe at all.
leafs,lxogzax,2024-11-17 19:30:40,Well sure if you want your number 1 to have .890sv and 2.77 Ga
leafs,lxpenko,2024-11-17 23:02:05,Murray is the only goalie to record two Stanley Cups as a rookie. That's pretty neat and also not that great when looking at everything since his rookie status.
leafs,lxoll8d,2024-11-17 19:58:01,Ehh the AHL has some pretty condensed schedules at times. Give him a few games to keep active and don't over work the other 2.For example they have a 3 game stretch Dec 10 11 12 and another Jan 21 22 24.3 games back to back or 3 games in 4 or 5 are pretty common down there so many times AHL teams use 3 goalies.
leafs,lxq4cm8,2024-11-18 02:46:09,I’m pumped too he is filthy. But had to correct your statement. Leafs actually haven’t had a promising goalie like this since Justin Poggie. Not Rask. He was gonna already at that point. Just saying.
leafs,lxoj4qn,2024-11-17 19:43:21,The coach for the Marlies said that Akhthamov reminds him of Sorokin when he was working with the islanders before. Would be quite nice if he becomes that
leafs,lxpebsl,2024-11-17 22:59:47,Just a dirty filthy boy.
leafs,lxnifol,2024-11-17 16:14:57,I’m okay with it as long as the next guy who does the same thing also gets 5 games
leafs,lxnh8v4,2024-11-17 16:08:29,Thought so. No malicious intent behind it but a sloppy and reckless hit from a repeat offender that resulted in injury.I think I'm of the unpopular opinion on this sub that actually likes Reaves but I REALLY can't argue against this honestly. Was a stupid and avoidable outcome.
leafs,lxnkip7,2024-11-17 16:26:21,Once again good suspension in a vacuum but there is no concept of precedent in the NHL so fuck Parros.
leafs,lxnjsws,2024-11-17 16:22:26,Jeannot's hit was more targeted intentional and also resulted in injury but he doesn't play for the Leafs so he got 3. Similar suspension / dirty play track record
leafs,lxnhj3c,2024-11-17 16:10:02,Fair
leafs,lxnihxs,2024-11-17 16:15:17,Seems fair. It was a brutal and very scary hit but I don't think Reaves was being malicious he just fucked up big time.
leafs,lxnhqoq,2024-11-17 16:11:10,Good but only if the NHL is truly intent on being more strict on headshots. Definitely got a Leafs tax (Jeannot for 3 plus Leafs Tax 2 = 5 Games)
leafs,lxnil60,2024-11-17 16:15:45,Fair suspension. Don't think the hit had any malicious intent but that's the type of hit we don't need in this game. Hope nurse will be alright. Was expecting to get more games due to the leafs tax
leafs,lxnkrng,2024-11-17 16:27:43,He should have got the same as Jeannot or Jeannot should have got 5 games as his was vastly worse IMO. But 5 games is still the right amount for the low end
leafs,lxnw1jl,2024-11-17 17:29:47,Not gonna lie I thought it was gonna be more than that considering spezza got 6 games for something way less worse.
leafs,lxntd7y,2024-11-17 17:14:56,Marchand wouldn't even have been given two mins.
leafs,lxo3h1g,2024-11-17 18:12:22,Sounds about right. He didn’t mean to have Nurses head be the primary point of contact he just missed his shoulder. Reaves is certainly not dirty but this was an ugly hit.
leafs,lxpa1a5,2024-11-17 22:30:25,Bout where it should’ve been. He really didn’t mean to do it. But he did.
leafs,lxnh581,2024-11-17 16:07:57,The next game is allowed to play isn’t until December 4th
leafs,lxnod15,2024-11-17 16:47:23,Yeah this was expected. Regardless of the intent from Reaves that was a bad hit to the head.
leafs,lxnxy4v,2024-11-17 17:40:34,Called it.
leafs,lxoakxn,2024-11-17 18:54:06,Right call on the suspension Nurse also not a clean player. Things have a way of working themselves out on the ice.https://youtu.be/sMMTJ9iC-Vo?feature=shared
leafs,lxoqk2z,2024-11-17 20:28:20,Not surprised given the idiot in charge of this stuff. That said it wasn’t that bad of a shot. Reaves went in shoulder to shoulder and Nurse put his head down at the last second. The image with the link here shows it pretty well the angle he was coming in at. Reaves could’ve pulled up more maybe but that wasn’t an intentional head shot of the sort that should result in five games. One game plus four for being a Leaf.
leafs,lxnxaxt,2024-11-17 17:36:51,Leafs about to win 5 straight!!?
leafs,lxoa2j1,2024-11-17 18:51:07,If Trouba threw this hit they'd serve him a medal
leafs,lxnwnzz,2024-11-17 17:33:14,5 games is good. Let’s hope they continue giving 5 game suspensions for similar hits
leafs,lxnz81x,2024-11-17 17:47:53,DAMN!! What a great loss to our power play...
leafs,lxnn0vo,2024-11-17 16:40:03,Hopefully Nurse is okay. Even if Reaves would have got him clean rather than the head he (Nurse) was going to get hurt. It would have ended up being a boarding and Nurse's injury might have quite possibly been worse.Nurse not taking a look a before going behind the net was not great nevertheless the suspension is fair.The next time we play the Oilers is Feb 1st in Edmonton...
leafs,lxnkzyw,2024-11-17 16:28:58,yep thought as much he'll probably appeal it down to 4
leafs,lxnq1na,2024-11-17 16:56:35,It's fair.
leafs,lxnq4x7,2024-11-17 16:57:04,Man if he had caught his shoulder instead of his head that would’ve been a text book perfect punishing body check.
leafs,lxnr9hz,2024-11-17 17:03:18,Hopefully we get a good look at what the 4th line can do without him.
leafs,lxns09m,2024-11-17 17:07:24,This is the right call…no intent whatsoever otherwise it would have been an in person.   Love Reavo but ya can’t have these hits
leafs,lxnwlpi,2024-11-17 17:32:52,I thought so.Obviously wasn't intentional and I do feel like he felt bad. But it's not surprising he got a suspension
leafs,lxo5f8d,2024-11-17 18:23:51,Just wish DoPS would take all headshots this seriously
leafs,lxoa8cz,2024-11-17 18:52:04,Honestly thought it would be worse 5 games is what a non leafs team repeat offender would get
leafs,lxor27w,2024-11-17 20:31:25,Deserved it but Parros is still a jackass
leafs,lxpi3u8,2024-11-17 23:26:37,Nurse had his head down. Is he stupid?
leafs,lxra6xb,2024-11-18 09:10:28,man it looks so bad in slowmotion but the game is so fast and what is reaves suspsoed to do? let him just skate out free? imagen the headlines if we thought he was the one afraid of the corners... 5 games seems about right. hope nurse gets better what a greatly athletic family hope he is well fast!
leafs,lxth8ru,2024-11-18 16:03:11,Should have been 20 games what a POS
leafs,lxnluk8,2024-11-17 16:33:35,Seems fair. Reaves does have a suspension history so he would have probably gotten 3 if this was his first offence. Clearly no intent to injure but still the head is primary point of contact and it resulted in a serious injury.As for Nurse though I wish the NHL did a better job of making sure players aren’t putting themselves in vulnerable positions. You can’t come around your own net leading with your head like that it’s just not safe. If this was 1980s to early 2000s that hit isn’t even a minor penalty.
leafs,lxnn2tq,2024-11-17 16:40:21,Deserved
leafs,lxnla3l,2024-11-17 16:30:30,Yeah there’s no defending that hit at the very least it was stupid and wreckless
leafs,lxnl9qg,2024-11-17 16:30:27,As Don Cherry would say “Gotta keep your head up”
leafs,lxnkz39,2024-11-17 16:28:50,Lifelong Leafs fan.It’s a fair consequence everything considered.
leafs,lxnr73z,2024-11-17 17:02:55,Again it only seems to be leafs that get appropriate punishment. DOPS remains inconsistent as fuck.Unfortunately timed hit without malicious intent gets 5 games whereas can openers flying elbows punches to the back of the head etc routinely go unpunished.I've said it before but DOPS isn't about player safety but public relations/ public opinion. They care far more about optics than safety which is also why Leafs get punished more harshly: more eyeballs.Not to mention everyone with a media pass tagging DOPS in their tweet 5 seconds after any borderline hit.
leafs,lxnsxew,2024-11-17 17:12:28,So we have a suspended fighter that has 1 assist and about 8 min/game with 0 fights.  Should have buried him for depth before he decided to act extra stupid.
leafs,lxo0p2n,2024-11-17 17:56:19,Good
leafs,lxnmclo,2024-11-17 16:36:23,5-0-0
leafs,lxnxnb1,2024-11-17 17:38:49,Also this should be an impetus to just keep Robertson in the lineup. Reaves hasnt fought a lot recently we dont need him in order to win. Nicky Bobby needs a proper run of time where he doesnt need to worry about his status and just play
leafs,lxoitnj,2024-11-17 19:41:31,It's okay but NHL needs consistency.
leafs,lxpa0bl,2024-11-17 22:30:14,Well deserved (although Nurse needs to have some common sense coming out of that play). However how does that warrant 5 and Jeannot gets 3 for an actual targeted head shot?!? DOPS and Parros can eat a CN Tower sized dick.

leafs,lxnquap,2024-11-17 17:00:54,It's fair. IMO it's actually too light. If I was coach I'd scratch him for another 5 on top of it. The way Nurse's head snapped around that could have been career ending. That could have left him paralyzed. You don't do that. Ever.

leafs,lxnoh59,2024-11-17 16:48:00,Hopefully the end of Ryan Reaves in Toronto. You can like him and understand that he's a waste of a roster spot. He doesn't fight he's too slow he doesn't contribute offensively and he's not some defensive wizard. In fact he barely plays. He's a 1.35 million dollar (or whatever it is) cheerleader vibes guy. That's all well and good but he can do that from the pressbox and bring the vibes to practice.Edit: What am I wrong about? Happy to hear differing opinions.
leafs,lxo3rkb,2024-11-17 18:14:07,Less games than I would have liked but at least we don't have to see that fucking plug in our lineup for a little bit.
leafs,lxouswt,2024-11-17 20:54:23,I think this is the end of Reeves he probably won't get back in until late December maybe January just fue to schedule and it's hard to stay up to speed at 38.
leafs,lxp64je,2024-11-17 22:04:53,The 5 games aren't a big deal but the 5 minute penalty- against the Oilers- hurt the teams chances; they barely escaped without being put in a hole by Reaves recklessness
leafs,lxnjhf1,2024-11-17 16:20:42,Fine. Fair. Good even. Wouldn’t have minded it being longer.It’s deserved.

leafs,lxno8fk,2024-11-17 16:46:40,Honestly fewer games than I expected. With the Leaf tax hnic tax non-star player tax and not being a good hit I expected 10+ games. Fair enough.
leafs,lxp02ex,2024-11-17 21:26:58,If he got 10 the leafs are better off. Make him play 15 minutes for those 5 games instead. That’s a more realistic suspension.

leafs,lxnl5ly,2024-11-17 16:29:50,Could have been way more But the NHL really hates suspending players unless a Star player is injured
leafs,lxnlb7m,2024-11-17 16:30:40,Jeannot did about the same to Boeser for three games. It is what it is I guess
leafs,lxoa8ib,2024-11-17 18:52:06,It never works out like that though. For example if Trouba threw this hit they'd serve him a medal
leafs,lxo1hy0,2024-11-17 18:00:54,totally agree but unfortunately leafs always pay the leafs tax when it comes to supplemental discipline
leafs,lxpey91,2024-11-17 23:04:06,Ha. The Boesser hit was only 3. It'll be five every time the Leafs do it.Edit: I didn't read any comments. This has been covered. Heading out now.
leafs,lxnqf1q,2024-11-17 16:58:36,This is not a recording
leafs,lxpjya6,2024-11-17 23:39:59,they won't
leafs,lxr79xo,2024-11-18 08:51:43,Jacob Trouba has entered the chat
leafs,lxpx0c6,2024-11-18 01:30:56,Im okay with it even if they don't. But I'll be screaming they should. Leafs fan or not you cannot justify that. Every rhetoric should start from that standpoint
leafs,lxnkcpt,2024-11-17 16:25:27,This is the only correct take.It was dumb and reckless but the people hysterically screeching about intent to injure are regarded.
leafs,lxnmquv,2024-11-17 16:38:31,I agree with everything other than repeat offender. He's only ever had 3 suspensions totaling 6 games.
leafs,lxnztmf,2024-11-17 17:51:16,Ya I thought the exact same thing. 5 games seems right cux it wasn’t a malicious play in that it was premeditated. It was careless. And I’m with you on that I don’t mind him. In fact I know he doesn’t have the points to show for it but he’s not as bad as a lot suggest he is. He seems to always put the puck on someone’s stick in a good spot. He might have some stone hands but his IQ is not that bad. He’s no Marner but he’s not like other goons where they are just an up and down player.
leafs,lxnmw8c,2024-11-17 16:39:21,yep. fair enough.
leafs,lxo067s,2024-11-17 17:53:16,Honestly just with how bad it looked and the fact it likely caused injury i was expecting worse. I mean compare the Reaves hit to Morgan’s crosscheck last year you’d never think they’d get the same number of games
leafs,lxo320s,2024-11-17 18:09:54,I like him too. Even if the main thing he brings to the team is vibes I think he’s a worthy addition.
leafs,lxoae4y,2024-11-17 18:53:00,I like Reaves too I think he’s worked wonders for the teams culture But this one was a bonehead move especially from a guy who doesn’t score
leafs,lxoriik,2024-11-17 20:34:12,Unpopular or not I like Reeves too. I think the suspension is high but we always get high. Just not the high I like to feel.
leafs,lxp6m3l,2024-11-17 22:08:04,This might be the most balanced take I've seen.My only add would be that it looked like nurse slowed up right before the hit and reaves tried to play the puck first before throwing the hit.That being said reaves is still responsible for acting recklessly. I'm not arguing against this being a suspendie.I just think parros is all over the place with his judgements
leafs,lxr83kg,2024-11-18 08:57:01,It was avoidable because left himself so vulnerable. If Reaves was a millisecond to his left it would have went through the body and still caught his head. Which if we use trouba as the metric would have been fine
leafs,lxnx8b0,2024-11-17 17:36:26,I didn't like Reaves but he really picked up the pace in the second half of the year and I'm glad we have an enforcer like him on our team. It's actually a detriment to our team to lose him for 5 right now I think.
leafs,lxnzop0,2024-11-17 17:50:29,Bad hit no real intent (leaving his feet etc). It was avoidable. No question to the head. Resulted in injury and maybe a long term one. 3-5 games suspension would the right fair call in the rules. He’s a repeat offender so 5 actually seems right on the money. I like Reaves I think he adds a lot to this team and hating on him is for complete loud mouth casuals to the game. This suspension was called correctly.
leafs,lxnt1cy,2024-11-17 17:13:04,Wdm great opinion
leafs,lxpr2sh,2024-11-18 00:36:25,Yes but if it was a payoff series.  Sadly as a Leafs fan I would not be upset about this hit on Nurse.  I don't like seeing guys get hurt but losing Reaves to take out Nurse.  But I also do not think Reaves wanted to go for the head just badly timed and wanting to hit Nurse hard.
leafs,lxsb7f5,2024-11-18 12:31:36,Wendel clarke hit Bruce bell and ended his career and no penalty hockey is getting soft Number 1 rule in hockey keep your head up or loose ot
leafs,lxnqxim,2024-11-17 17:01:24,Totally.  Reaves was reckless and should be punished under the rule book but Jeannots hit has zero place in the league and the intent to hurt was clear.
leafs,lxnu33f,2024-11-17 17:18:57,I went and rewatched the Jeannot hit. It appeared to me he let up a little and didn’t fully follow through.  Reavo’s drove right through Nurses head and was a more violent hit in my opinion.
leafs,lxnll1e,2024-11-17 16:32:09,It really wasn't intentional he recognised that and even went to the Oilers locker room to apologise face to face (according to Elliotte Friedman). But as you said lack of intention doesn't make it less brutal or scary. Fair suspension.
leafs,lxnn98d,2024-11-17 16:41:20,The hit was similar but the history was not. Reaves got the extra 2 for his history. I’m all for ragging on Parros because he’s an absolute gorilla but this is actually shockingly consistent.
leafs,lxnk5s0,2024-11-17 16:24:23,Tbh a Leafs tax in a situation like this would be Reaves getting fewer games and more opportunities to get into the lineup.
leafs,lxoio1d,2024-11-17 19:40:34,That was my baseline. I was very ready to not see Reavo again til 2025.Parros must really fucking hate Nurse.
leafs,lxnwvhm,2024-11-17 17:34:23,They won’t
leafs,lxod7mj,2024-11-17 19:09:23,Nurse was staring at the puck and didn't see him coming. If reeves hit him in the jersey nurse would of went flying into the corner
leafs,lxon596,2024-11-17 20:07:27,This one actually is fair.But all the other non-leaf suspensions that got less games needs to be fixed.
leafs,lxre0kq,2024-11-18 09:34:07,This
leafs,lxreaw8,2024-11-18 09:35:52,Exactly reeves is on the ice for one thing…..and it ain’t his prodigious goal scoring capability….Steeves brings a hell of a lot more than him.
leafs,lxno1jp,2024-11-17 16:45:37,Agreed there is still a risk he’ll play for the Leafs again. Parros strikes again!
leafs,lxnifxk,2024-11-17 16:14:59,Nah we’ve had more controversial suspensions in the past. This one won’t make too much noise it’s pretty reasonable.
leafs,lxnlzu1,2024-11-17 16:34:26,It won't. We almost unanimously agree that that was a bad hit and he deserved suspension. The few that disagree and say it was Nurse's fault for not keeping his head up are just idiots looking for a few minutes of popularity.
leafs,lxnwybm,2024-11-17 17:34:50,People heard he went and apologized.
leafs,lxqb9gm,2024-11-18 04:02:51,While it was touch and go that penalty kill was fucking epic and set us up for the rest of the game I felt in the belief stakes.
leafs,lxnmmdx,2024-11-17 16:37:51,A Leafs fan on the Leafs subreddit?Seems suspicious.
leafs,lxohyf8,2024-11-17 19:36:23,Just about to say the same. Reaves had to pay the Leaf tax. I don’t care about the suspension I just want to see consistency. FUCK Parros.
leafs,lxo7z1c,2024-11-17 18:38:53,The Jeannot hit was worse because it felt way more targeted/intentional but we all know Leafs will set the high bar for suspensions so basically what I expected
leafs,lxnmzdn,2024-11-17 16:39:49,Reaves history bought him an extra 2 games.
leafs,lxoyg82,2024-11-17 21:16:57,Reaves does have a history of headshots but I think he is also paying the Leafs tax a bit.
leafs,lxnnkq3,2024-11-17 16:43:05,Well Reaves is a repeat offender. I believe that was Jeannots  first suspension
leafs,lxph8fn,2024-11-17 23:20:28,2 game lead tax. Reaves deserves it though. I’m not complaining about this one
leafs,lxoj3xl,2024-11-17 19:43:13,And 99% of reddit would call it clean for some reason
leafs,lxr7wjo,2024-11-18 08:55:47,Bunting due to his hit being the playoffs if you calculate vs a regular season suspension  is the longest suspension ever handed out
leafs,lxnlrub,2024-11-17 16:33:10, heard he went to the oilers locker room to apologize. Reevo is tough but he’s too much of a genuinely good guy to be malicious like that
leafs,lxnspzc,2024-11-17 17:11:19,The people screaming about intent have never played a sport let alone hockey in their lives. I played college hockey and at times the speed of that game was overwhelming to me. There’s no way I would have made it to the National. The couch potato’s have absolutely no idea the speed at which these things happen. In Reavos mind he was going for the shoulder. He anticipated Nurse bringing his shoulder around to brace for the check. It didn’t happen. Reavo miscalculated the hit. It’s so easy to do.
leafs,lxo5i75,2024-11-17 18:24:20,Meanwhile on r/hockey the Moral Superiority League are in a fierce competition to see who is the **most** fake-outraged by thisLeaf flairs inevitably pop up decrying their own player and drowning in upvotes Same thing happened with Kadri
leafs,lxnsl2b,2024-11-17 17:10:33,Exactly…the Facebook idiots are out in full force bitching and moaning.   If it was intentional there would have been an in person hearing
leafs,lxnlu58,2024-11-17 16:33:31,Bedarded*
leafs,lxo6iro,2024-11-17 18:30:17,I agree with this  
leafs,lxpaqrn,2024-11-17 22:35:11,Hm indeed. Regards.
leafs,lxo0911,2024-11-17 17:53:43,It’s not provable however intent to injure may have been present. The fake half-assed poke check is cover for what’s been intended as a hit the moment he started toward Nurse.But like I said it’s impossible to prove. NHL’ers are very professional so there is no point in debating. Intent is fully obscured whether intentionally or coincidentally. From a human standpoint it definitively *looks* malicious.
leafs,lxnn3ta,2024-11-17 16:40:30,One was for a head shot I believe.
leafs,lxnwejz,2024-11-17 17:31:47,Repeat offender status has nothing to do with total suspensions and isn't used to calculate the number of games suspended. It's a second suspension within an 18 month period. So by definition in this instance he was not a repeat offender.
leafs,lxnoejh,2024-11-17 16:47:36,So he's an offender who's then repeated two more times after that lol.
leafs,lxqzuc8,2024-11-18 08:01:00,I think that's where intent makes the difference. You really can't argue that Reaves' hit didn't end worse than Morgan's crosscheck. But you REALLY can't argue that Reilly didn't mean to do that while you certainly could with Reaves.
leafs,lxo8dnh,2024-11-17 18:41:15,He's kinda sucked this year though. He was better and I defended him for his good 4th line play the 2nd half of last season but the 4th line hasn't been nearly as good so far this season especially when Reaves plays.
leafs,lxo8q2g,2024-11-17 18:43:14,You can visually see Jeannot miss the shoulder and in an attempt to still get him in the chest instead of dropping his shoulder into the collarbone decided to follow through right into Boesers jaw. In fact it looks like his right skate leaves the ice before he even makes contact with Boeser what are you saying?
leafs,lxop9cx,2024-11-17 20:20:22,Exactly. It could have been a dislocated shoulder and concussion at that point. 
leafs,lxnmdmj,2024-11-17 16:36:31,Most people saying 3-5 in the game thread last night. Totally deserved suspension.
leafs,lxnzr04,2024-11-17 17:50:51,Apologies are nice but they don't fix CTE.
leafs,lxp6hl4,2024-11-17 22:07:16,Nurses head was ready to pop off it's vertabray. Not sure what you're looking for here.
leafs,lxtqt8j,2024-11-18 16:51:28,No leaf tax. It's based on his history. This is him.
leafs,lxrrmb5,2024-11-18 10:50:54,Jeannot's hit was clear intention. Boeser had played the puck forward way before the hit came in. Nurse had the puck Reeves just took a terrible angle of approach I honestly believe. The hit to the head also looked a lot worse as Nurse's head and neck jarred violently to his left. Both hits are equally bad imo. They should have received the same punishment. The only thing that makes me upset is that Jeannot clearly intended to hurt Boeser. Reeves often clumsy might have just just mistimed his approach and was trying to provide pressure on the forecheck. Maybe I've got my Blue & White glasses on but Parros clearly has an agenda. Reeves has history but Jeannot clearly intended to injure.
leafs,lxnng52,2024-11-17 16:42:23,1 for history. 1 for parros' leaf tax.
leafs,lxnqdfa,2024-11-17 16:58:21,History shouldn't count. The repeat offender thing only extends for 18 months. Reaves last sussy was in 2021 I believe.
leafs,lxnw3e0,2024-11-17 17:30:04,No a blue jersey in a marquee Saturday night game between two of the biggest draws in the league bought him an extra 2 games.
leafs,lxp4cdf,2024-11-17 21:53:29,This is his 4th suspension in almost 900 games.
leafs,lxnto3h,2024-11-17 17:16:38,I don't think he counts as a repeat offender due to the NHL rules of 18months for repeat offender.
leafs,lxoesme,2024-11-17 19:18:26,Sucks you got downvoted you’re right. Repeat Offender is an official status used in calculating the fines him having prior discipline can still be taken into account for dishing out punishment
leafs,lxovh2r,2024-11-17 20:58:30,If I said what /r/hockey really was I would get suspended from reddit for a while
leafs,lxny3f9,2024-11-17 17:41:25,I believe it. Supposedly him and Darnell are good buddies.
leafs,lxnyi95,2024-11-17 17:43:47,Ive never viewed Reavo as a dirty player even when wearing other colours. A Menace a tough SOB a damn good fighter….yes. Dirty malicious not so much. That hit was suspendible but I had it at 3 games. I dont believe Reaves targeted Nurse’s head was reckless nevertheless
leafs,lxnwpss,2024-11-17 17:33:30,I hope that's true
leafs,lxnvj8o,2024-11-17 17:26:57,"Those guys are always hilarious like ""if I was on the ice then I'd..."" what hold onto the boards cause you can't skate. The game is fast it's even faster in person and even faster on the ice."
leafs,lxo0lht,2024-11-17 17:55:45,Yeah the complete casuals are hilarious. The speed just to make an accurate  pass out of the corner over the age of 16 in any level where everyone can fucking skate is hard enough without getting your head taken off. Let alone timing at the NHL.
leafs,lxo6pt8,2024-11-17 18:31:27,Anyone who has played contact hockey knows when you round your net with your head down and exposed like that it’s dangerous. It sucks that it happened to him but it’s also a miscalculation on his part. Hockey players have a responsibility to make sure they aren’t in a vulnerable positions. The game is so fast players are expected to play hard and fast every shift we are taught from a young age to finish our checks.
leafs,lxsbmu8,2024-11-18 12:33:46,Great comment I played in the 70s and 80s with many that turned pro I don’t condone head shots but nurse had his head down looking at the puck a cardinal sin
leafs,lxoapoe,2024-11-17 18:54:52,The pickme’s are out in full force right now. It’s like they think other fans are going to love them or something
leafs,lxo107v,2024-11-17 17:58:06,Let me be clear.There's a 0% chance Ryan Reaves intentionally tried to pick Nurse's head in order to injure him and anybody who thinks he did has spongiform encephalopathy.
leafs,lxnnmxw,2024-11-17 16:43:25,I absolutely agree to be harsher on repeat offenders. But I wouldn't call Reaves a repeat. Wilson 7 suspensions with one 7 game for boarding yes. Kadri yes 6 times with a crosscheck to the head suspension.
leafs,lxnwirv,2024-11-17 17:32:25,That it not what repeat offender means in this context
leafs,lxo9wyk,2024-11-17 18:50:13,I watched it again now. I feel less now that he let up. It’s hard to describe these things. But my impression he let up a bit was based on the rotation of his body just after contact had the shoulder that made contact moving away from Boeser. I still think the contact didn’t look as hard as Reavo’s. Neither hit is acceptable.
leafs,lxo2axf,2024-11-17 18:05:32,You know what else helps prevent CTE? Not skating out from behind your own net with your head down. That’s literally rule 2 they teach you at age 12. 
leafs,lxqggzv,2024-11-18 05:01:41,I'm pretty sure he just wants to see consistency.
leafs,lxr7gbf,2024-11-18 08:52:52,I won't argue the principle point of contact on the hit. I don't get why nurse left himself so vulnerable. You could hear them yelling in the broadcast that Reaves was on him
leafs,lxoa6vt,2024-11-17 18:51:49,As is tradition
leafs,lxpnrcg,2024-11-18 00:08:49,I hear Nazem Kadri also got two game for this incident as well.
leafs,lxo38z3,2024-11-17 18:11:03,Repeat offender is for calculating fines you can consider all history in issuing a suspension
leafs,lxnrw8w,2024-11-17 17:06:46,Repeat offender vs history are different things afaik.
leafs,lxr7o9w,2024-11-18 08:54:18,This isn't a Reaves typical play.  Reaves isn't a rat. How does trouba ALWAYS get away with his hits is more confusing to me
leafs,lxsices,2024-11-18 13:07:16,Yes
leafs,lxp5c5f,2024-11-17 21:59:49,Nah repeat offender status is only for 18 months. His previous one was 2021
leafs,lxr85wi,2024-11-18 08:57:26,You could see how upset he was leaving the ice
leafs,lxtvhh9,2024-11-18 17:15:44,Probably told him dude told you I'll get a nice hit on you....but man be efn ready for it
leafs,lxsr24c,2024-11-18 13:51:02,You dont head hunt your buddies. He aimed for the head. I dont care what anyone else has to say.
leafs,lxpq7es,2024-11-18 00:29:00,He definitley thought Nurse was going to square his shoulders but I don't think it's fair to try to get inside a player's head one way or the other when talking about the punishment. If you were to watch the video with no previous knowledge of the players involved you would 100% say he targeted the head.I think the suspension was fair.
leafs,lxrx2qt,2024-11-18 11:19:47,Reaves has four suspensions two in the playoffs and three fines.He is absolutely a dirty player lol. You can argue he isn't intentionally trying to hurt people but there are tough big hitting players that *don't* get reprimanded nearly as much as him

leafs,lxnowwo,2024-11-17 16:50:25,You only need one previous suspension to be considered a repeat offender. I think when it comes to head shots the suspension should be a little more severe but it also needs to be consistent with previous suspensions for similar type hits.
leafs,lxo04wq,2024-11-17 17:53:04,And that 7 gamer shoulda been way more.  Was the worst hit I’ve seen in the last 10 years.
leafs,lxo7142,2024-11-17 18:33:21,And Nurse's helmet was loose also.There's a rule that it has to be on tight. But the NHL doesn't enforce it. They should
leafs,lxo5wa8,2024-11-17 18:26:36,C'mon man I'm not saying Nurse didn't make a mistake or that he didn't deserve to get KOd (you can still be KOd by a clean hit) but Reaves ONLY hit Nurse's head. There was no other point of contact in the hit. That is what I'd like to see eradicated.
leafs,lxr8s47,2024-11-18 09:01:24,this is a very old school way of thinking though.  the one thing they have been clear and...consistent...about is that its on the hitter not the hittee to protect themselves.  he's making a play on the puck...likely braced for a shoulder check. not for his head to be knocked off.i'm all for great hits and physical play.  i dont think Reaves was targetting his head.  but thats what he hit.
leafs,lxoe571,2024-11-17 19:14:46,This is a great day for Canada and therefore the world
leafs,lxtv2fw,2024-11-18 17:13:30,He had no choice in this matter shit flows down....he had to get something out of (Kadri) I mean...
leafs,lxtv8qg,2024-11-18 17:14:27,Right....wasn't a hit from Trouba like a month ago and they said it was clean
leafs,lxp5h1e,2024-11-17 22:00:41,Repeat offender status for the purpose of increased fines yes. That does not mean that his prior suspensions are ignored when he has new hearings
leafs,lxnqgtu,2024-11-17 16:58:53,This is correct. If you have even one suspension for the same offense you are a repeat offender. In this case Reavo does have a previous hit-to-head suspension and it should absolutely be an aggravating factor in consideration of punishment.
leafs,lxobvq1,2024-11-17 19:01:42,They also shouldn’t let players skate off in those kinds of situations. Like what are the paramedics even standing by for if they can’t make that call. 
leafs,lxo68wv,2024-11-17 18:28:38,Has nothing to do with my comment or the one I replied to. It’s hockey there is a large precedent that your safety is in your own hands. Not many people deserve that and it’s unfortunate but it’s hockey and he was off by a couple inches from that being a totally clean hit. 
leafs,lxnratg,2024-11-17 17:03:30,The Department of Player Safety considers someone a repeat offender for 18 months following the most recent suspension. While Reaves does not fall into that category his past history may still be considered.That’s clearly what happened here.
leafs,lxnrsvt,2024-11-17 17:06:15,Yeah I'd heard about the rolling 18 month thing for suspension generally but I thought it was always considered a repeat if it's the same offense as a previous instance?
leafs,lxow6rm,2024-11-17 21:02:55,No the repeat is strictly the 18 months but they can factor in whatever they want into their decision. The repeat label only dictates how much salary is forfeited
leafs,lxordw5,2024-11-17 20:33:24,Did not expect a line of Robertson-Kampf-Holmberg to be ahead of Nylander-Domi-Knies

leafs,lxmgvl4,2024-11-17 12:55:08,The fact Boston and Ottawa are ~10% and ~20% more likely to make the playoffs while being 5 and 7 points back of the Leafs show this is a joke. Boston is largely healthy (Hampus Lindholm recently went down) and Ottawa is fully healthy. We're missing Auston freaking Matthews and still clear both.
leafs,lxmgtjg,2024-11-17 12:54:49,At 51% bet the house.
leafs,lxmlftp,2024-11-17 13:19:49,Yeah this model is an outlier. The Athletic (Dom) has them at 96% to make the playoffs. Hockey Reference has them at 74%. BetMGM’s odds give them an implied probability of 85%.
leafs,lxmm1is,2024-11-17 13:23:03,The Sens have almost the same chance of winning the Cup as the 15-3-0 Jets. Enough said.
leafs,lxmhq67,2024-11-17 12:59:47,The sens being 20% above us just proves this model needs to be thrown out
leafs,lxmnv7j,2024-11-17 13:32:40,Is this the year that Boston squeaks into the last wild card spot. Or better yet gets bounced out by Wings isles Sens etc?
leafs,lxmpa7z,2024-11-17 13:39:59,Where can I bet my entire savings account on the under on Tampa’s projected points?
leafs,lxn62v9,2024-11-17 15:09:22,I've posted about this a few times. Copy pasted below (from a few days ago before the Caps game).Moneypuck odds now have us at less than 50% of making the playoffs with Ottawa up to 82.7%. During our 3 game streak preceding the most recent loss we dropped in playoff odds with each win even though the game preview indicated a raise on a win each time (obviously).I think maybe the Moneypuck algo really cares about 5x5 goals and we just aren’t really producing there. Sens and Buffalo are also doing well which contests the spot. Maybe they’re assessing team strength excluding players on IR so Matthews leaving dropped our strength? Hard to say.The Athletic still has us at 92% for playoffs so the deviation between models is huge now.
leafs,lxnkvp1,2024-11-17 16:28:19,Moneypuck rhymes with stupidfuck and I think that is significant
leafs,lxo5qte,2024-11-17 18:25:43,This doesn’t make any sense.
leafs,lxobhu1,2024-11-17 18:59:27,Go home money puck you're drunk.
leafs,lxmiabo,2024-11-17 13:02:51,https://i.redd.it/i5xl3dbh4i1e1.gif
leafs,lxmjroa,2024-11-17 13:10:53,If I remember correctly Moneypuck had the leafs one of the highest percentages to win the cup at the beginning of the season. They have always overrated the leafs. That’s what makes this so odd. They should have them a lock to make playoffs. Winning in the playoffs is a different story.
leafs,lxmrbd6,2024-11-17 13:50:28,This thing got about as much credibility as the deserve to win-o-meter
leafs,lxo0rtx,2024-11-17 17:56:46,Where do I bet these odds?!?! This is hilarious
leafs,lxmq0b8,2024-11-17 13:43:38,To have Boston and Tampa ahead of Toronto is comical
leafs,lxmtx2w,2024-11-17 14:04:00,How do I bet on those odds?
leafs,lxn6w3s,2024-11-17 15:13:49,This makes sense as per their model. We are at the bottom third in expected goal percentage. We are giving up more chances than we are generating. Winnipeg is also not high because they have an absolute insane shooting percentage save percentage and pp percentage none of which are sustainable long term. 
leafs,lxnhn82,2024-11-17 16:10:38,And Vegas has them at like second best odds to win the cup. 
leafs,lxmn54f,2024-11-17 13:28:54,Isn’t money puck a reflection of the bets taking place and not what they determine the odds to be?
leafs,lxmg6n3,2024-11-17 12:51:19,It's because most of the fancy stats look like shit from the bad losses early and have tanked even more with 34 out.
leafs,lxmllt7,2024-11-17 13:20:41,What do they make these predictions on? Is it amount of wins projected? How do they come up with this number?
leafs,lxmpcm0,2024-11-17 13:40:20,I suspect this will sort itself out by midseason. It’s a bit confused by the early results so far.
leafs,lxmrez6,2024-11-17 13:51:00,This dumbass model swung like 30% in a few days after we lost a couple.
leafs,lxmui4s,2024-11-17 14:07:02,[deleted]
leafs,lxmuo8x,2024-11-17 14:07:53,Maybe this model weighs the number of back-to-backs and times played against rested teams while tired heavily? Someone posted a chart recently where the Leafs are high in both categories compared to others. I can't remember the Sens or Bruins but I'm just trying to make sense of it. I'm more confident in this team than years past so I think they can weather those odds.
leafs,lxmwc3t,2024-11-17 14:16:35,Pack it in boys.
leafs,lxmxe2l,2024-11-17 14:22:07,What the puck?
leafs,lxmysoh,2024-11-17 14:29:39,2nd in the Atlantic by 5 points with Matthews rehabbing an injury…this table is totally fucked.
leafs,lxmzcs0,2024-11-17 14:32:42,So what are the betting odds? Leafs are still winning even without their captain and best player
leafs,lxmzdz8,2024-11-17 14:32:53,lol lmao even
leafs,lxn1l75,2024-11-17 14:44:49,The guy (Leo Breiman) who developed the statistical approach used in this model (gradient boosting) did a lot of his research for the US Navy to try to find Russian subs. I.E. they're trying to boost a signal from the noise. For the Leafs it's probably just picking up that Matthews hasn't been playing and projecting that into not making the playoffs. Goals for less goals against is super predictive in hockey  and would make more sense to focus on than throwing fancy algorithms at the data.
leafs,lxn292j,2024-11-17 14:48:27,Forget Boston how is Tampa ahead by 40%+ (5 points up with 3 games in hand and I think it’s fair to say on average they lose more than one point over 3 games lmao).
leafs,lxn2aim,2024-11-17 14:48:41,At this stage of the season these kinda things are absolutely meaningless. But it does stir the pot.
leafs,lxn4qmj,2024-11-17 15:02:06,Perhaps Money puck only took into account the awful CBJ and Ottawa games lol

leafs,lxnjn9x,2024-11-17 16:21:34,They are on a 104 pt pace right now so...what is going to cause the 10 pt drop?
leafs,lxno1sy,2024-11-17 16:45:40,"I just looked at our schedule and there's very few ""easy matchups"". We have a tough schedule of opponents. But we're also a tough opponent on most other teams schedule. So it evens out. Plus we're playing alright minus one of the League's best players.Let's see how his injury plays out.  We also have the skill and depth to grind out a good season.Random though (don't judge me too hard) but imagine us playing AM on the third line if our top two get some chemistry going. I know I know.Edit: just checked the standings we're second in our division behind the Panthers. We're also two points away from being tied for second in the league (with a few other teams)."
leafs,lxnp85a,2024-11-17 16:52:09,They also have Ottawa at 70% so what do they know.
leafs,lxnwfq4,2024-11-17 17:31:58,I mean.....they are second in the division with a winning record but they honestly don't look good at all. Their 5v5 game is legitimately terrible. They have been bailed out by goaltending all season. Last nights game should have been a loss but Bouchard single handedly gave the game back to us. Same thing with the Washington game.
leafs,lxo2oas,2024-11-17 18:07:40,i dont think higher than TO but Ottawa like could sneak in a playoff spot. i think it is possible but way to fuckign early to be giving leafs a 51% lol. they never cease to surprise me though.

leafs,lxmgjcw,2024-11-17 12:53:16,Sens at 70%. Hahahh
leafs,lxnhl38,2024-11-17 16:10:19,Weekly reminder that Moneypuck thinks hockey is played entirely 5v5 with the exact same league-average goaltender on each side. It's useless and safe to ignore.
leafs,lxnw1ef,2024-11-17 17:29:45,I stopped using them after they heavily favoured us to win like 5 straight years in the playoffs and we still lost
leafs,lxuabz1,2024-11-18 18:38:32,[Dom's model](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5898487/2024/11/05/nhl-playoff-report-month-one-analysis/?campaign=11604929&source=targeted_email&userId=124689) had them at 89% about 2 weeks ago and [evolving-hockey](https://evolving-hockey.com/blog/2024-2025-team-point-projections/) has them at 86% right now.
leafs,lxnrfrr,2024-11-17 17:04:16,You don’t get models
leafs,lxmg1b0,2024-11-17 12:50:31,We haven't been favourites that many times tbh due to us facing Tampa so many times. The time we won we were favourites though.Last year we certainly weren't.
leafs,lxmmvv7,2024-11-17 13:27:31,We do shit when we aren’t the favourites as well
leafs,lxmtf3x,2024-11-17 14:01:25,Ottawa/Boston: currently .500Toronto: currently .632In the salary cap era a team that finishes the season .632 has never missed the playoffs and a team that finishes the season .500 has never made the playoffs (excluding covid play-in). The cut-off is usually around .550-.560 with the odd year where a team makes it at like .530-.550 in a weak division or misses at .560-.580 in a strong division.
leafs,lxnfx2e,2024-11-17 16:01:30,For real I wish Vegas had these odds
leafs,lxnoxgw,2024-11-17 16:50:30,So you're saying there's a chance.
leafs,lxmnjf2,2024-11-17 13:30:57,Well that's just because they're in the same division as low percentage teams like the Toronto Maple Leafs.
leafs,lxn6nu7,2024-11-17 15:12:33,Ah ok maybe the 5x5 goals is where they are getting this.  I genuinely thought it was an error when I first saw it this morning. I still think it's ridiculous though.  I would have thought the leafs are upwards of 90% without looking at anything. This model is a complete joke.  I would love to hear from money puck about this.
leafs,lxmvnn9,2024-11-17 14:13:00,No Moneypuck just has a super flawed model. I think they do have ties to gambling but their model is mostly based on xG (which the Leafs are top 10) but with some really bizarre weighting and also underrate goaltending (hence why a 15-3-0 Winnipeg team with Hellebuyck isnt the top odds playoff team in the league). The model also loves shots which is why Carolina is always at or near the top despite taking a quantity over quality approach to shots and having just average goaltending.
leafs,lxn7qoi,2024-11-17 15:18:23,Moneypuck is based on a model/forecast it has nothing to do with betting odds.
leafs,lxmt65m,2024-11-17 14:00:07,[deleted]
leafs,lxmh5qd,2024-11-17 12:56:40,No they havent. Moneypucks own model has the Leafs 11th in the entire league in xG% at 5-on-5 and 8th in all situations. Their playoff prediction model is just all sorts of broken.
leafs,lxn8gh4,2024-11-17 15:22:13,https://moneypuck.com/about.htmTells you a bit about the model but not enough to understand why teams are at specific place at a specific time.

leafs,lxmzy6d,2024-11-17 14:35:49,I think our goaltending is why the money puck model is low on us. They probably see that as unsustainable. For what it's worth more years money puck loves the leafs so maybe it's best they're low on us this year
leafs,lxontye,2024-11-17 20:11:40,I mean you gotta factor in curses when it comes to the Leafs.
leafs,lxmyuq0,2024-11-17 14:30:00,*Making* the playoffs though?I can see Moneypuck being dicks and giving a token 1% to make the second round but the boys are absolutely punching their tickets to the post season.
leafs,lxmznsr,2024-11-17 14:34:18,They usually make the playoffs …..
leafs,lxmzwvj,2024-11-17 14:35:38,That makes absolutely no sense lol we have made the playoffs like 8 years in a row.
leafs,lxmmcmt,2024-11-17 13:24:41,2 less games played 7 points behind  yet 19% higher odds of making the playoffs. sounds about right for moneypuck
leafs,lxmginu,2024-11-17 12:53:09,I was mostly referring to reg season when we are favourites to win games and we fail and embarrass ourselves in the process (SL Blues Ottawa Senators etc.)
leafs,lxp2a7n,2024-11-17 21:40:46,That is some good math but you're forgetting that we are actually talking about the Leafs here.  We've cycled through multiple terrible ways to lose in round 1 so we might be up for just not making the playoffs now.

leafs,lxn7qyx,2024-11-17 15:18:25,Moneypuck is based on a model/forecast it has nothing to do with betting odds.
leafs,lxn4ek2,2024-11-17 15:00:16,It’s laughable that Ottawa has a better chance than us to win the division.  And the Rats can watch out  we’re 1 point behind them
leafs,lxn5570,2024-11-17 15:04:18,So I thought it was that as well as maybe shooting slightly better than expected. But Dallas is performing better in both of those than us especially goals against vs expected. Their Corsi and Fenwick are better but their xg% is pretty similar. So there's probably something else going on a little deeper? Idk doesn't quite make sense to me at first glance. Divisions would come up Dallas is the tops in expected numbers in their division while the Leafs are 2nd to Ottawa. But that's still weird to have such a big discrepancy. Strength of schedule maybe?
leafs,lxpckqp,2024-11-17 22:47:37,If they went by projection based on last years stats that wouldn’t work either. He had a 2.03 GAA in 27 games.

leafs,lxmsuyd,2024-11-17 13:58:31,Ya if they looked back they would see that these moneypuck odds always seemed to have us near the top. Maybe not the top but like top 4 to make the finals or some shit like that. The change might be what we need even if it means nothing lol

leafs,lxn767e,2024-11-17 15:15:18,Strength of schedule gonna be defeated by the leafs getting the most back to backs and the most back to back vs rested teams vs the rest of the league. At least I would figure that should be true given those facts
leafs,lxnab2k,2024-11-17 15:32:07,The Bruins and leafs are literally tied for longest streaks of making the playoffs at 8/9 i believe but yeah history of making the playoffs is a factor….
leafs,lxoppd2,2024-11-17 20:23:05,The model is heavily influenced by underlying stats but it's not making anything up. Ottawa has significantly better Even-strength xGoal % off bad shooting % and bad goaltending all of which means that if they keep playing the way they are the model expects them to win a lot more.The Leafs have a bad Even-strength xGoal % and good goaltending both of which means (to the model) that they should get worse. Only thing working in their favour is low shooting %.The model isn't wrong. Statistically in the long term a team playing like Ottawa will finish higher in the standings than a team playing like Toronto right now. That said the model can't really account for Matthews' absence which is a massive factor. And the Leafs' overall superior talent should drive improved numbers...but models won't assume that.
leafs,lxmeay1,2024-11-17 12:40:56,Definitely Cruel to the Oil fans in attendance last night. Last shot of OEL’s video tribute being him lifting the cup with a bunch of dejected Oilers players in the back ground. Kind of set the stage for the whole night. Fantastic work Brian as always.

leafs,lxr77jc,2024-11-18 08:51:17,Shoutout to Stephen Lorentz who went from a yearbook photo asking where he’ll be in in 15 years and stating “playing for the Toronto maple leafs” to taking a locker room pic with Mitch Marner and John Tavares after an OT win vs McDavid and the oilers.
leafs,lxrkmx3,2024-11-18 10:12:48,People want to shit on Marner all the time for his playoff performance or lack there or but no one criticizing Matthews because he's our golden boy.Stop with the double standard.
leafs,lxrexo3,2024-11-18 09:39:40,Ooh love this right on. Hopefully Mitch gets to see this. Such an intelligent dynamic player. Love it when he’s on top of his game.
leafs,lxu9xpn,2024-11-18 18:36:14,I wish these were longer
leafs,lxogwhb,2024-11-17 19:30:13,I like Marner. I've liked him since the Leafs drafted him (didn't follow OHL at all before that). Its just his contract and his Dad that most people actually don't like and that gets projected onto Marner hmself. The absurdity that he's got someone whispering in his ear that he's worth as much as Matthews is why people choose not to like him. He is a consistent regular season performer that is an important part of the PK seems to be liked by teammates and occasionally makes a mind boggling pass but the reality is that he simply is not a game breaker. Matthews and Nylander are a threat to end a game everytime they have the puck. Tavares and Rielly to a lesser extent. Marner is an important passenger but is in no way is he conducting the train despite his point totals. The Leafs are definitely better with than without him but the contract matters and I hope he eventuslly realizes that.
leafs,lxn5rsr,2024-11-17 15:07:40,It's the same every year myself included until spring.
leafs,lxnxyyh,2024-11-17 17:40:42,Remember? That implies it isn't still happening. I've seen people in the gametime thread hating on Mitch when he's got multiple points on the board. All Leaf fans are insane we kind of have to be with how this team has been the last 50+ years. But there's fun generational trauma insane and then there's the folks who need serious help.
leafs,lxnal3w,2024-11-17 15:33:40,Everyone loves 82 game Mitch. April is the problem. He's not a needle mover come April like he is Oct-March.
leafs,lxndlwj,2024-11-17 15:49:42,Honestly I take it as a personal affront that he's playing so well.
leafs,lxrfu8u,2024-11-18 09:45:06,We're all fans...we get pissed because he has a bad habit of disappearing in the playoffs...moreso than the other guys.   He needs to stay relevant come playoff time to earn that trust back.    I've got no issues saying in the regular season he makes his doubters eat crow myself included...But we need to see it in the playoffs when it matters
leafs,lxoowia,2024-11-17 20:18:12,Im a fan and I don't hate Mitch.  I also understand we may need to let Mitch go for cap space to rebalance the roster.  It's sadly a possibility in the hard cap world.  I think Mitch is an amazing player and love watching him.  I also know he has issues between the ears and when he gets down on himself or tries too hard it doesn't go well.  At the end of the day and want the core 4 to succeed and see all of them win with us.  However if we don't see major gains in the playoffs this year under the new coach.  Well I think moving on from the core 4 is what we have to do and Mitch and JT are just the easy guys to move off of.  Maybe it works just moving on from JT as well.  I don't know but there is still an argument for dropping Mitch until we have playoff success.  In the meantime Im just enjoying watching my team play and rooting for all of them
leafs,lxray1r,2024-11-18 09:15:12,The guy is living the dream!
leafs,lxorb45,2024-11-17 20:32:55,> but the reality is that he simply is not a game breakerWhat a stupid thing to say after what he just did.
leafs,lxo9l38,2024-11-17 18:48:17,Was gonna say. I rarely have any complaints about him from October to April. The problem we all have with him is that he vanishes 3 games into the playoffs every single year.
leafs,lxopiyq,2024-11-17 20:22:01,You disagree with the playoff argument?
leafs,lxqjml8,2024-11-18 05:35:51,Exactly this post is celebrating his game-breaking goal lol
leafs,lxovzcr,2024-11-17 21:01:38,Sample size and recency bias. Grow up. McDavid had a bad game is he now a liability to his team?
leafs,lxoqi0f,2024-11-17 20:27:59,It just pisses me off that no one dares to criticize Matthews who has a worse playoff record than Marner.
leafs,lxoqu7v,2024-11-17 20:30:03, It's fucking ridiculous to be blaming one player for a team failure.
leafs,lxpiezp,2024-11-17 23:28:52,So what you are saying is…. McDavid to Toronto for future considerations and 50% retained. Boom
leafs,lxrkfs0,2024-11-18 10:11:41,This.
leafs,lxsgdxu,2024-11-18 12:57:23,Matthews definitely gets his fair share of criticism in the playoffs seems he got a pass this most recent year due to his big point night and then being on his deathbed the rest of the series.
leafs,lxor7iv,2024-11-17 20:32:18,I didn't say that.Are you ok with his performance in the playoffs? Just Mitch isolated.
leafs,lxsha5k,2024-11-18 13:01:53,And the Marner haters conveniently forget the Marner was came back early from a high ankle sprain. It honestly doesn't matter what anyone says the haters are gonna do whatever mental gymnastics they have to do to support their hate.
leafs,lxp9qgq,2024-11-17 22:28:25,I'll look at the last 3 playoff runs. 21-22 played 7 games 8 points +322-23 played 11 games 14 points +723‐24 played 7 games 3 points +1Although he definitely has a poor showing in the most recent campaign yes I would say I am more than okay with his overall playoff performance.

leafs,lxqmfn2,2024-11-18 06:05:29,I don't have to explain anything to you. You asked if I am okay with his playoff performance and I confirmed that I am. 1pt+ per game player in both the regular season and playoffs. Does he get nerves? Yeah I don't think anyone denies that. I still want him on the team.
leafs,lxppp23,2024-11-18 00:24:40,Some people are dumb enough to isolate an irregular period of 3 games over a small chunk of time and think it means something.  Go ahead and take away Mitch. You'll be crying we don't even get to game 5 6 and 7 anymore
leafs,lxranci,2024-11-18 09:13:21,Now cherry pick the 3 games where he performs the best and you will create the exact opposite narrative.
leafs,lxpqhlm,2024-11-18 00:31:24,You're changing subject. We're looking at Mitch's play in isolation. Can you explain the above stats by anything other than Mitch crumbling under pressure?
leafs,lxsmybk,2024-11-18 13:30:26,5 straight years of same stat is cherry picking?
leafs,lxquaw6,2024-11-18 07:17:53,> Some people are dumb enough to isolate an irregular period of 3 games over a small chunk of time and think it means something.
leafs,lxt025p,2024-11-18 14:36:04,It is when the sample size is 2% of his total games played and deliberately ignores his impact in the playoff games that would make him the top producer of the core 4.Why not isolate it down to the 11th-22nd minute of game 6 only? Does game 3 count less than game 5? Do you only get 0.5 wins for game 2 and 1.5 for game 6?
leafs,lxnyu79,2024-11-17 17:45:40,One of his best in a while

leafs,lxlrlen,2024-11-17 10:34:17,I was in attendance last night. For a mid-November regular season game the crowd was electric. Felt like a playoff game with the atmosphere. McDavid and the oilers coming to town definitely helps just wish every home game could be like that lol.
leafs,lxludng,2024-11-17 10:50:16,I took my son for his first game last night and it was awesome. We chatted with some Oilers fans and were having a great time. A leaf fan got up just before OT and said “We’re going to lose anyways.” Well he got razzed pretty good as he came back 
leafs,lxm4btq,2024-11-17 11:45:36,Bouchard's effort on McMann's second goal is tied for me with the Reaves hit for most disgusting thing I saw last night.
leafs,lxm9fv6,2024-11-17 12:13:52,That Oilers team needs major work if they expect to contend again this year. Even McDavid and Draisaitl firing on all cylinders can't make up for that D and goaltending.
leafs,lxm0a1i,2024-11-17 11:23:25,Missed the game last night but oh man that Mitch OT winner was sick!!!
leafs,lxm4po3,2024-11-17 11:47:41,"Great game. I met a family sitting close to me. The father was born in Boston and grew up a Bruins fan. He moved to South Carolina and came to the game last night with his family. They were at the SWIFT concert the night before and decided to go to the Leaf game yesterday. At the beginning of the game the dad told his kids ""we are cheering for the blue team"". There were two young 97 fans close by yelling all game saying they wanted a hatty. By the second period the two American girls were yelling go Maple Leafs. It sure was entertaining."
leafs,lxn2sd8,2024-11-17 14:51:22,Jets had once job lmao. That minute as 1st in the Atlantic over Florida was fun while it lasted lol
leafs,lxlrn5j,2024-11-17 10:34:33,T’was a fun game for sure a real roller coasterI have to admit that Reaves’ hit was pretty dirty. I honestly wonder if he brings much value to the team
leafs,lxn3v68,2024-11-17 14:57:16,Marner playing with so much more swagger with AM out of the lineup. Dude can shoot wish he did it more often.
leafs,lxnk90d,2024-11-17 16:24:53,Can they just keep winning? Let Auston rest for as long as he needs to.

leafs,lxlszmx,2024-11-17 10:42:17,They brought him in last year to help promote toughness. This year's team is the toughest since the early 00s and Reaves contributed to that. That's his value not the ice time.
leafs,lxlttdb,2024-11-17 10:47:02,Really hope Nurse is okay. That was a scary outcome and I'm shocked he didn't end up on a stretcher the torque on his neck from that hit was scary. Reaves brings a lot of energy (not speed but energy) when he plays physical. But that was a dirty play
leafs,lxrz9zj,2024-11-18 11:31:11,If last night’s game was a playoff game we would have been happy to trade Reavo for just about any member of their team leaving the series.As far as dirty hits go this one doesn’t register too highly for me other than the outcome being so gnarly
leafs,lxm6rsr,2024-11-17 11:59:02,I feel like Oilers are just stylistically a great matchup for the Leads

leafs,lxlvngb,2024-11-17 10:57:35,Yeah that always seems to be the case when it's arguably the best player in the league. It's the same thing I noticed when I was growing up with Crosby/Toews and Kane. Lots of young kids had them as their favorite players and in turn cheered for the Penguins/Chicago. Those games used to draw a fairly decent 'away' crowd.
leafs,lxn65kv,2024-11-17 15:09:48,Dangle had a small bit where he breaks down that play.Bouchard glides into the zone watching McMann blow by him Bobby's goal bounces so quickly out of the net that Bouchard thinks it's a rebound and he's *immediately* 100% effort again because he has an offensive chance.Dude seems like a winger that switched to D for a better draft opportunity
leafs,lxnhocz,2024-11-17 16:10:48,I wish we could move to the western conference
leafs,lxm3jag,2024-11-17 11:41:15,Would you care to explain how Reaves made the team tougher?
leafs,lxm5hjc,2024-11-17 11:51:57,Explain how this is the toughest Leafs team since the early 00s and then specifically how Reaves has contributed to that. 
leafs,lxlyo60,2024-11-17 11:14:28,He absolutely should have been on a stretcher and the league should not let cases like this skate off the ice. We will see a change in the future I guarantee it. 
leafs,lxnkaca,2024-11-17 16:25:05,That was hilarious but the whole sequence made no sense. He had the shortest path to the puck if he tried at all but decides his partner on the other side should get it?
leafs,lxm5qzi,2024-11-17 11:53:25,I said he contributed to it. It's not rocket science come on. He plays hard practices hard riles up the guys. The more of that you have the more it rubs off on others and reinforces that culture.
leafs,lxm60yh,2024-11-17 11:54:57,He just beats them if they play like cowards. Really you just play like your a couple inches taller when you know you have some like that on the team
leafs,lxmjjrx,2024-11-17 13:09:42,I gotta be honest I don’t see him playing hard most of the time he’s skating around not doing much of anything because he struggles to keep up. 
leafs,lxm61aa,2024-11-17 11:55:00,It’s possible you’re right but I just don’t see it. Other players have been on the teams similar to Reaves. What makes him so special?
leafs,lxm7gdx,2024-11-17 12:02:51,Lmfao so he’s all their daddy and will get the belt if they don’t play hard.
leafs,lxm7l6c,2024-11-17 12:03:34,He's not special. I'm just stating why they brought him in. He's a loud and prominent personality in the room though and by all accounts every teammate he's ever had loves him. A guy like that is going to be influential.
leafs,lxm92z3,2024-11-17 12:11:53,Fair enough
leafs,lxl9lik,2024-11-17 08:36:58,Parros bricked up to lay the hammer on a Leaf.
leafs,lxla5nh,2024-11-17 08:41:06,"As usual when the Leafs are involved it will be a longer-than-usual suspension and we'll all say ""well headshots are bad so if it's a new precedent then that's a good thing.""Then someone will do the same thing tomorrow night get a shorter suspension (or just a fine) and we'll hear a thousand bullshit reasons why this one is different and Reaves' hit was worse etc etc."
leafs,lxlajtr,2024-11-17 08:43:58,This is adding insult to injury for Oilers fans because Reaves getting suspended is actually good for us lol
leafs,lxla8qb,2024-11-17 08:41:44,I mean he’s getting games no doubt you can’t have essentially the only point of contact with another player be their head. That being said what was Nurse thinking out there? Guy goes around the back of the net and doesn’t even think to look up.
leafs,lxlmyn9,2024-11-17 10:06:46,I bet he gets 5 games …. Say what you want but it was a bad hit.  Nurse should have seen him coming but Reaves missed his timing and he’s going to pay the price.
leafs,lxlnmji,2024-11-17 10:10:46,I’m gonna say a 3 game suspension maybe 4 because it’s Toronto. Not a good hit on Reaves part hopefully Nurse is okay but man you gotta keep your head up coming around the net him getting up and walking off was a good sign. Honestly I don’t believe Reaves was out there with real malicious intent to injure the guy. It was just a bad hockey hit in which Reaves should have made a better judgement call on but hockey is a fast heat of the moment sport sometimes.
leafs,lxl9sbu,2024-11-17 08:38:23,He definitely deserves a suspension. Ya can't hit people like that. I expect they'll make an example out of him.
leafs,lxl9j8a,2024-11-17 08:36:30,Phone or in person?
leafs,lxlipni,2024-11-17 09:40:15,Parros is the sweaty guy choice meme right now. Throw the book at a Leaf vs. Go easy on an enforcer.
leafs,lxls6f2,2024-11-17 10:37:38,1 game and a position in the Department of player safety after this season
leafs,lxmdf41,2024-11-17 12:36:00,Here comes another bullshit call from the player safety non biased George Parros 
leafs,lxlwc9h,2024-11-17 11:01:33,High yes targeted no. The match penalty was more than sufficient. No intent unlike a hit in the Florida-Winnipeg game 
leafs,lxlksh7,2024-11-17 09:53:31,I get Reaves plays with an edge to his game but seeing him labeled as a dirty hitter could not be further from the truth. By the DOPS’ definition he’s not even considered a repeat offender. He’s been suspended twice before this for illegal checks and it had been 4 years since his last suspension. He’s laid over 1000 hits since his last suspension it’s not like he’s Raffi Torres out here where he’s expected to take a suspension every season.Obviously the hit was bad it deserves to be punished and treated as a dangerous hit. It’s like when someone is called for tripping more often than not it’s not an intentional penalty that someone is trying to take (unlike roughing or crosschecking). I think Nurse being hunched over and Reaves trying to compensate for the height difference between the two is what ultimately led to the injury. I think he gets 5 games that are retroactively reduced to 4 games as he received a match penalty on the play. I hope Nurse makes a speedy and full recovery and that he and Reaves can squash the tension and move on to the next game.
leafs,lxlagpn,2024-11-17 08:43:20,I'd prefer it to be a lengthy suspension because head hits are awful and we need to stamp them out and I think the team is still better off with Reaves not in the lineup.That being said I'm also ready for this to get 3-5 games and the next 10 head shots to get fines and 1 game suspensions
leafs,lxli4io,2024-11-17 09:36:24,The dopshits have decided to give Kadri a five game suspension

leafs,lxmwsto,2024-11-17 14:19:01,3 games that’s all folks
leafs,lxnbnm4,2024-11-17 15:39:31,Say what you want but the Darnell Nurse  hit was absolutely dirty. I actually hope Parros does suspend him. This kind of hit needs to be abolished to the furthest part of another realm. It’s not funny or even a hit that should happen. I’m a Leafs fan and it pissed me off seeing the replay.
leafs,lxlcfl5,2024-11-17 08:57:28,If Parros really wants to punish Reaves he should make him play 25 minutes per game for 3 straight
leafs,lxlb1kk,2024-11-17 08:47:31,Oh no please don't suspend him the rest of the season. I'd hate to have to call up a hungry Marlie
leafs,lxllezx,2024-11-17 09:57:24,There's multiple faults here really. 1. Nurse really should have some awareness when on the ice. Players should not be expected to check to make sure the player is paying attention when on the ice. So Nurse is at fault for that. Specially a D man like dude.... be aware... if you see a train coming ya don't keep going. Nurse could have stopped or braced. 2.Reaves shouldn't have hit him in the head but again Nurse wasn't paying attention. Reaves took advantage of that and delivered a massive hit. Most the people I watched with all said it.... clean hit. Even the announcers agreed. So it's a Grey area in full honestly...Cause 1 Nurse should have some situational awareness and 2 reavo shouldn't be hitting the head like that but it all again ties back to... have some awareness! Both players.
leafs,lxljuvp,2024-11-17 09:47:38,Parros will give the suspension to Marner instead
leafs,lxm1bkq,2024-11-17 11:29:06,Not a good hit but if you're going to skate through the Valley of Death you better keep your head up. That's 101 hockey.
leafs,lxm94l8,2024-11-17 12:12:08,As he should…I love Reavo and it was 100% unintentional but we can’t have that kinda hit in the game…PLUS you just know that Parros saw that hit and went![gif](giphy|Dps6uX4XPOKeA)

leafs,lxlhyib,2024-11-17 09:35:19,Reaves went out of his way to make this hit. Looked like charging to me in addition to being a headshot. I know Reaves is an enforcer but I don't traditionally think of him as a dirty player.  I was originally thinking 3 to 5 games. He did basically get a game already as this was still fairly early on in the game and he got a major penalty/kicked out.  More than 5 I think would be a bit harsh but we will see.
leafs,lxlc2xy,2024-11-17 08:54:58,5 games max
leafs,lxljw46,2024-11-17 09:47:51,I mean no shocker. Leaf and not a star player. He’ll get the book thrown at him.It was a bad hit. So I’d be fine with it regardless. But the inconsistent standards are a frustrating thing.
leafs,lxmjafw,2024-11-17 13:08:19,It will be a 5 game suspension.
leafs,lxlk7bd,2024-11-17 09:49:50,Any other team probably 3 games.  Since it is the Leafs he will be getting 6+.
leafs,lxldl8b,2024-11-17 09:05:39,We all see big hits and have no penalties.  Nurse  should have his head up. Toronto players got hit like that and there were no calls. How about the goalie interference smashing into our goalies???? High stick to face to McCabe last game no call. You know Reaves likes to hit...... B .S Other teams get to hit but we can't.
leafs,lxlcd3q,2024-11-17 08:56:59,Can the Reaves experiment end already?  What has he brought to the team this season that another league min player couldn't?
leafs,lxlaw15,2024-11-17 08:46:25,5 games or more I’m guessing
leafs,lxmcmb9,2024-11-17 12:31:35,Solid clean hit I miss the days of real hockey.... I was always told since I put skates on to keep my head up 
leafs,lxlbxja,2024-11-17 08:53:54,Why do they keep saying “Illegal check to the head.” are there “legal checks to the head”?
leafs,lxlftje,2024-11-17 09:21:05,Everyone around the league seems to agree that he’ll get 5 games.  Parros will give him 20.
leafs,lxlhbq0,2024-11-17 09:31:09,I’d say three is the minimum ten is the maximum (wide range I know but this is Parros and his “Dartboard Of Bullshit” so 
leafs,lxlt8fc,2024-11-17 10:43:42,Am I crazy thinking that 5 games isn't crazy. It's not in person so 5 is the max and that seems fair seeing as it's a 4th line enforcer hitting a guy square in the head at full speed Nurse is for sure injured from the play and the Oilers did not score on the powerplay. I know the powerplay result and injury are not supposed to be a factor but almost always are
leafs,lxmy8oi,2024-11-17 14:26:38,Just some plain old nasty head hunting shit from Reaves.
leafs,lxmithy,2024-11-17 13:05:44,As much as the DOPS sucks and is wildly inconsistent this isn’t the place for comments about how Parros is out to get the Leafs or any of that. That was an absolutely terrible hit and should be a huge suspension. 8-10 games.
leafs,lxm5m1r,2024-11-17 11:52:38,That was a terrible headhunting hit that may have long term effects on a person's health. Reeves deserves a long suspension. Let's avoid turning this into a whinefest about the DOPS and move on.
leafs,lxm3w8o,2024-11-17 11:43:12,At least there was a Nurse on site right away....
leafs,lxm59qx,2024-11-17 11:50:47,I'd be shocked if it was under 5 games. Take the average length someone on Florida would get and multiply by at least 2 to apply to Canadian teams. For the record the hit sucks it deserves 2-4 games to me. So I won't be shocked when he gets 7 or 8.
leafs,lxlhq9s,2024-11-17 09:33:49,Better be 5 min is Jeanot got 3 for his hit on Brock. Reaves should be getting 5 min.
leafs,lxmbo32,2024-11-17 12:26:15,Throw the book at him it was a dirty hit my only worry is that headshots like this won't be enforced the same with other teams
leafs,lxla2f9,2024-11-17 08:40:26,I’m going to say four games. That was pretty targeted violence which imo tends to be the litmus test for suspension length.
leafs,lxlfbhs,2024-11-17 09:17:40,I sent this video to my buddy who hasn’t watched hockey in 15 years but played decently high level. He said that hit was clean as fuck and that nurse should keep his head up.So with that being said 20 games for reavo 
leafs,lxllwyi,2024-11-17 10:00:27,Should be 3 to 4 ganes max.It will be 6 to 7. Is what it is.
leafs,lxlr62q,2024-11-17 10:31:47,He's already been suspended 3 times in his career IIRC... I'd say this one will be 15 appealed down to 10-12 would be my guess. I'd be pretty shocked if it were under 10.Some of the blame is definitely on Nurse. You can't be skating around with your head down but Reeves definitely could have adjusted slightly and not took his head off.
leafs,lxler56,2024-11-17 09:13:46,Sorry he’s a habitual offender. He should get a boatload of games. That was a ridiculous hit
leafs,lxlobew,2024-11-17 10:14:57,But wouldn't a long suspension to Reaves benefit us? Gets more of the guys we need in the line up a place to go.Bad for Reaves because he might lose his spot. But I know Berube likes him.
leafs,lxlj11o,2024-11-17 09:42:18,Brooo parros is going to give him a 1 day game suspension cause suspending him for 10 games would be doing us a favor haha
leafs,lxnlzev,2024-11-17 16:34:22,![gif](giphy|gaZ51cn7sUY4U|downsized)George Parros ladies and gentlemen.
leafs,lxlli2o,2024-11-17 09:57:55,The Kadri suspension after DeBrusk had 3 suspendable plays in the same game was ridiculous. How Parros still has a fucking job is nuts. It's not his fault he is a walking case of CTE but he shouldn't be in charge of anything.
leafs,lxlbyme,2024-11-17 08:54:07,I mean I don’t really care if they throw the book at him for this one that was a fucked up hit. But I agree that it would be nice if other teams got suspended by the same rules the leafs do I just wish headshots were an automatic 5 game suspension or something like that instead of bullshit spinning the wheel and giving one guy 1 game and another guy 7
leafs,lxm6vnj,2024-11-17 11:59:37,Yeah there is no such thing as a precedent for NHL Player Safety. Completely unaware of the concept.
leafs,lxlf2tb,2024-11-17 09:16:00,Reaves has been suspended 3 times in his career so wouldn’t be surprised if it’s a longer suspension
leafs,lxmc84t,2024-11-17 12:29:23,I mean if Morgan Reilly’s cross check last year was 5 games I can’t see reaves getting away with anything less than 8.
leafs,lxlgj59,2024-11-17 09:25:50,They might make it short because when he's playing its like 5 on 4.5
leafs,lxlr1b7,2024-11-17 10:31:01,I disagree. Reaves is an inconsequential player in the lineup and his suspension won't hurt the team too much. DOPS will give him like 2 or 3 games so that next time they can drop the hammer on a better Leaf and point and say see we aren't biased!
leafs,lxmb85j,2024-11-17 12:23:50,Reeves hit was real bad dude. This should be a longer suspension 
leafs,lxm2ref,2024-11-17 11:37:00,This instance I'm totally fine with the longer suspension lol
leafs,lxm87w9,2024-11-17 12:07:04,But the infraction was against an Oilers player... usually that means a less than normal suspension so I'd say it should average out.
leafs,lxlaq51,2024-11-17 08:45:14,The only thing I would counter to that is Nurse never had his head up and Reaves went through with the hit.    In 1992 that's a hit making it on Rock em Sock em and we laugh at Scott Stevens ending Kariya's career.  Reaves never had a clean hit in the lead up to that hit.  It's dumb hockey from Nurse but Reaves had every opportunity to let up and not go through his head
leafs,lxlz97q,2024-11-17 11:17:45,Precedent is 3 for the Boeser hit. Which means toronto tax gets Reaves 5
leafs,lxnj49h,2024-11-17 16:18:40,Nurse cross checked Tavares 3 times 2 while on the ice. This was payback and nurse got what he deserved.
leafs,lxmaso0,2024-11-17 12:21:28,He should get 5 games. That was a bad hit and he should get a big suspension.Everyone else who lays that kind of hit should get the same
leafs,lxm5ljv,2024-11-17 11:52:34,Try 7 or 8. This is a Canadian team so DOPS will multiply the precedent by 2.
leafs,lxmt8cj,2024-11-17 14:00:26,Reaves badly timed the hit.If nurse was a single foot ahead of where he was when he got hit then it's shoulder to shoulder.
leafs,lxl9w08,2024-11-17 08:39:08,1 game
leafs,lxlpkq9,2024-11-17 10:22:25,Yeah def deserves a suspension but not example worthy imo.
leafs,lxlpnlt,2024-11-17 10:22:54,They always set a precedent against the leafs and then just go back to normal suspensions fir the next team.
leafs,lxleueq,2024-11-17 09:14:23,Of course he's a Leaf they always make examples out of Leafs
leafs,lxl9pp6,2024-11-17 08:37:50,I think it’ll be phone. They usually specify if it’s in-person.
leafs,lxlqjqr,2024-11-17 10:28:08,Phone hearing
leafs,lxlavpq,2024-11-17 08:46:21,Prison actually
leafs,lxllool,2024-11-17 09:59:03,Yeah we definitely don't want Steeves or Cowan in the lineup. We're *doooooomed* lolEdit:  was my sarcasm not strong enough? I'm agreeing with the guy above.
leafs,lxlnoam,2024-11-17 10:11:04,I'm sorry. Most of the people you watch Hockey with clearly don't know Jack shit about Hockey. The main and only point of contact was the head which hasn't been legal for a good fucking while.There's clearly a reason there's a suspension happening and it's not cause it was a clean hit.
leafs,lxn7fef,2024-11-17 15:16:40,It's dead cap.
leafs,lxlc48k,2024-11-17 08:55:14,Parros is conflicted. It's a leaf so he wants to end his career but he also likes to see goons act like goons. Parros is such an embarrassment to the league.
leafs,lxllyxh,2024-11-17 10:00:47,Please don't be that person. We don't need other hockey subs / the hockey world thinking we're a bunch of degenerates.
leafs,lxm4aep,2024-11-17 11:45:23,I mean the guy has played his role well and done some good things out there within his skillset. It really can't be argued he doesn't take a shift off.Does he lack finesse? Yes. Does he bring the kind of energy you want from your 4th line? Also yes. Our 4th line has hemmed opponents in their own zone for extended amounts of time regularly this year Reaves is a big part of that.That's all you really want from your checking line and they've done well this far. Even got some goals out of that line and again... Just because Reaves isn't putting a huge number of points on the board doesn't mean his work out there doesn't contribute.
leafs,lxld6e2,2024-11-17 09:02:45,There can be incidental contact where they attempted to move out of the way or couldn't move out of the way  (as deemed by the ref) but still hit the head.
leafs,lxm5nmi,2024-11-17 11:52:53,You’d probably also be shocked that over 5 games requires an in-person meeting be offered and therefore this is 5 or less.
leafs,lxm63se,2024-11-17 11:55:22,That makes sense-if you completely ignore the fact that a suspension of 5+ requires an in-person meeting as opposed to over the phone
leafs,lxlua9b,2024-11-17 10:49:44,Telephone hearing.  Can’t be more than 5.
leafs,lxmamr9,2024-11-17 12:20:32,Why are people so horny to get him out of the lineup? We’re 7-2-1 in our last 10 games and he’s been pretty good given the context of his role on the team. I don’t think opening up a spot for Alex Steeves is going to move the needle.
leafs,lxljej5,2024-11-17 09:44:43,We are punishing the leafs by forcing Reaves to be on the first line and must have the most ice time for the remaining games in the season. You must also give him the C
leafs,lxlm97n,2024-11-17 10:02:32,Day game as opposed to a night game.
leafs,lxlp08v,2024-11-17 10:19:02,Ofmg
leafs,lxlyild,2024-11-17 11:13:35,This is what the NHL gets for doing nothing but meme hires to run DoPS
leafs,lxmqnvh,2024-11-17 13:47:03,And also fuck SAM BENNET WHY WASNT HE SUSPENDED?
leafs,lxnmcpp,2024-11-17 16:36:24,Dude. Michael Bunting getting the 6 game treatment for a less vicious hit in the damn playoffs with no previous suspensions.
leafs,lxleqnp,2024-11-17 09:13:41,That’s how things would be if the league actually gave a shit and didn’t just pretend to.
leafs,lxljzem,2024-11-17 09:48:25,The hit was hard and a little high and suspendable but it’s not even one of the worst hits this season so far. At some point d-men need to get their head up when coming around the net.  If Reeves stayed down for another split second that hit is clean and nurse still gets blown up.
leafs,lxllom1,2024-11-17 09:59:02,That only matters if it’s recent .: I think 18 months is the threshold
leafs,lxmiwd0,2024-11-17 13:06:10,5 games.  Done!
leafs,lxlq3vu,2024-11-17 10:25:33,[deleted]
leafs,lxn2skz,2024-11-17 14:51:24,It’s not an in person hearing for Reavo so it can’t be more than 5 games
leafs,lxlcbyf,2024-11-17 08:56:45,Kariya’s career didn’t end there though?
leafs,lxmbr72,2024-11-17 12:26:44,The Boeser hit was way worse though. This shouldn’t get more than that.
leafs,lxlb0u5,2024-11-17 08:47:22,I’m guessing 3 since Reaves has had multiple 2 game suspensions already.I don’t think it should be 3 but when I try to see things from the scrambled blurred vision of Parros that’s where I land.
leafs,lxlexs1,2024-11-17 09:15:04,Well phone would indicate less than 5 games I believe. Which seems unlikely.
leafs,lxlf0ak,2024-11-17 09:15:32,Reavo gonna go to the clink and end up coming covered in tats and jacked......
leafs,lxmiye8,2024-11-17 13:06:30,Cowan is in the OHL
leafs,lxlnu31,2024-11-17 10:12:03,Again though.Nurse should have had his head up. Ya don't drive a damn car into traffic and close your eyes do ya?
leafs,lxlpllf,2024-11-17 10:22:34,Yeah it was a completely illegal intentional check to the head. As a Leaf yes we get a lot of bullshit calls against / no calls for us but nothing like this in the last two seasons.The Rielly situation is the next thought that comes to mind but that was a glance off the shoulder **then** to the head and Riedly turtled down but got **right** back up.. no lasting injury and Rielly still got the suspensions he did (and TBH Rielly shouldn't have done it in the first place anyways)Nurse was HURT and from some of the slow Mos you can see a neck is NOT supposed to twist around like a god damn Owls so this makes this one even worse.
leafs,lxlumi2,2024-11-17 10:51:41,Ohhh really? I must have missed that. I thought they said in person. Perfect then. I thought Parros was set to throw the book at him.
leafs,lxmfof3,2024-11-17 12:48:33,The mix in the bottom 6 just isn’t working And with our anemic 3rd line offender we could use a fourth line that can go out there with any of them - and that can’t happen with Reaves on it
leafs,lxljqt7,2024-11-17 09:46:54,Haha he must now start every pp pk and ot
leafs,lxm14l0,2024-11-17 11:28:01,Shanny was better in that role and then they went complete 180.
leafs,lxorenm,2024-11-17 20:33:32,It was “the rest of the round” because it’s not about the value.. it’s about fucking with the leafs
leafs,lxlwbkm,2024-11-17 11:01:26,What hit was worse? Brutal to think that’s possible because last nights hit was absolutely horrible.
leafs,lxlw1lf,2024-11-17 10:59:49,"18 months is to be labeled as ""repeat offender"" which really only means two things: 1) a label in the record books 2) he loses money per game instead of per day which is roughly twice as much moneyThey can use any part of a player's history regardless of that 18 month number even events that weren't deemed as supplemental discipline at the time"
leafs,lxm2twn,2024-11-17 11:37:22,It's not in person so 5 or less I think.
leafs,lxnakz5,2024-11-17 15:33:38,I just heard that in a video 10 minutes ago. That is shocking to me. I’m glad I didn’t bet money on it.
leafs,lxlj81u,2024-11-17 09:43:34,He came back to score the game winning goal    *doesn't remember doing it but he scored*
leafs,lxljmii,2024-11-17 09:46:08,No but it was generally seen as the beginning of the end. To this day Paul Kariya is dealing with concussion issues which is a huge part of the reason he hasn't stayed involved with the game into retirement. It's been implied he is bitter about the league not doing more.
leafs,lxlcdnc,2024-11-17 08:57:05,So it’s 5-7 then.
leafs,lxlcuty,2024-11-17 09:00:29,I agree. Jeannot’s hit was way worse. This didn’t look malicious at all. More like a guy trying to blow up his opponent and missing.
leafs,lxld237,2024-11-17 09:01:54,I’m going to say 10. Spezza got 6 with no priors and not being a goon. I think parros will throw the book at him since he has a vendetta against the leafs
leafs,lxlf7i3,2024-11-17 09:16:54,Every time there is an in-person hearing they say it’ll be in-person with the date and time TBD.Phone hearings are 5 or fewer.
leafs,lxlx6vu,2024-11-17 11:06:17,Reaves: Is this a joke to you?[<image>](https://images.dailyhive.com/20231013162747/reaves-maple-leafs.png)
leafs,lxlog8u,2024-11-17 10:15:44,If you see me going down the wrong way on the street with my eyes closed are you going to speed up and hit me as hard as you can?No one's arguing that Nurse should or should not have been hit. It's Hockey not soccer. However it was a clearly an illegal hit to the head. I understand Reaves is a shit player but he's not so shitty that he can't avoid making the only point of contact the head.
leafs,lxlq4ob,2024-11-17 10:25:41,Exactly. This isn't a situation of Reaves going into a big board hit Nurse getting bad positioning and Reaves being unable to disengage from the hit. He goes right through Nurse at top speed and the only point of contact is shoulder-to-head. When they made the checks-to-the-head rule it was specifically for crap like this. It was textbook and I hope the league throws said textbook at Reaves.
leafs,lxlvx70,2024-11-17 10:59:08,Maybe it was a follow up release.  The hit on Brock I thought was at very least as bad he got 3.  I see Revo getting 3 maybe 4 with Toronto Sat night in Canada game tax.  Worst case 5.  Hopefully Nurse is ok.  Revo mid timed it.
leafs,lxpj11t,2024-11-17 23:33:25,4th line is doing exactly what they are expected to do. Keep the puck in the offensive zone and put a little fear in the other team 
leafs,lxm1rww,2024-11-17 11:31:34,Yeah they keep chasing the dragon of Shanny not being an utter joke in the role and keep rolling snake eyes with mopes like Parros.
leafs,lxlygrp,2024-11-17 11:13:18,Tanner Jeanot on Brock Boeser was probably worse? 
leafs,lxlwdo2,2024-11-17 11:01:46,Thanks for clarifying my misunderstanding
leafs,lxmdhml,2024-11-17 12:36:22,That’s why I was confused lol. I was really young and didn’t get into hockey until mid 2000’s so Im missing a lot of context here. I knew he scored after that but not that he didn’t remember it wild
leafs,lxmd7l7,2024-11-17 12:34:50,Oh wow cool thanks for the context
leafs,lxlwp25,2024-11-17 11:03:31,Suspensions over 5 games requires the player being offered an in-person hearing.Those usually take a little bit longer to get underway and they announce ahead of time that the player is being offered the in-person.  With the quick turn around on this hearing and no one mentioning (DoPS or insiders - that I've seen at least) means its likely just a phone hearing meaning the result could be no discipline a fine or up to a maximum of 5.Personally based on Parros' history with the Leafs and Reaves playing history I bet it's between 3-5 games.
leafs,lxlf90a,2024-11-17 09:17:12,It’s definitely going to be in that range because it’s Reeves who’s currently a Leaf and it’s Parros…
leafs,lxllmbm,2024-11-17 09:58:39,10 is insane. It should be 3 (see tanner Jeannot hit last week) but it will be 5.
leafs,lxldm55,2024-11-17 09:05:50,Yeah but this seems to be a phone hearing not in-person.
leafs,lxn2ra7,2024-11-17 14:51:13,Sure but how many will Kadri get?
leafs,lxlltgc,2024-11-17 09:59:52,And anyone who isn't white. The only explanation for the Kadri suspension was that it was racially motivated.
leafs,lxlfp7f,2024-11-17 09:20:15,Agree...15 it is.
leafs,lxlhl28,2024-11-17 09:32:51,Isnt the DOS in Toronto anyways? Probably just head down to get it done with. Or Parros is just being lazy and wants to get this done since its Sunday.
leafs,lxlfc7t,2024-11-17 09:17:48,Interesting. I'm pretty shocked I gotta say!
leafs,lxlxj9t,2024-11-17 11:08:12,Isn't it just an option to have the in-person hearing. I seem to remember a player this year turning down the in-person hearing.
leafs,lxlp00i,2024-11-17 10:19:00,"I agree with ya there but same idea if I'm walking down the street. If I'm paying attention chance to move out the way. I kinda feel this hit specifically was a double error. Both players should be faulted. Just due to nurse not having his head up. And I wish I had more on ice time myself cause Reaves maybe was already speeding up expecting nurse to.... be a bit aware of the incoming freight train.So I know it's hard when I player is injured like this but if I really think about it. Both players should ""do better"""
leafs,lxlzktb,2024-11-17 11:19:33,>If you see me going down the wrong way on the street with my eyes closed are you going to speed up and hit me as hard as you can?You think Reaves saw him with his head down and went harder than he would've with his head up? That's quite the claim.
leafs,lxlwj8e,2024-11-17 11:02:38,Yup this 100%.I love Reaves don't get me wrong. I HATE things like this though. 'Make hockey violent again' by fighting when it is due and hitting when it is due not being a fucking goon just to injure players I always say in a game get injured with a clean hit or a clean fight? I won't say shit it happens. Get injured on a dirty hit? Not your fault and ALL my sympathy will go to that player. No matter who the team is.I hope Nurse didn't break a vertebrae in his neck. The concussion is already going to be enough and put him out quite a few games.
leafs,lxmkh2x,2024-11-17 13:14:42,He's done inter views about coming back out to score the game wining goal and not remembering anything after the hit. Very scary and would of never been able to happen in today's nhl
leafs,lxlxnvr,2024-11-17 11:08:53,Eh 10 seems reasonable for almost killing nurse. That was crazy dangerous.
leafs,lxldpv7,2024-11-17 09:06:33,Ah true. What’s the max for phone? 5? I’ll take that then 
leafs,lxlwyql,2024-11-17 11:05:01,Parros has proven inept at his job time and time again but there is no reason or evidence to sling accusations of racism around.
leafs,lxltd19,2024-11-17 10:44:25,lol….
leafs,lxlri7p,2024-11-17 10:33:46,New York
leafs,lxm00se,2024-11-17 11:22:00,Yeah the language they always use is ‘offered’ an in-person hearing.
leafs,lxm1zl0,2024-11-17 11:32:45,That comparison was used to indicate that if you see someone in a vulnerable position your not going to harm them despite the fact that they may have positioned themselves in a vulnerable spot. So no I'm not indicating Reaves sped up. However he didn't slow down and he didn't make any attempt to avoid the head in my opinion.Reaves is going for the hit. Reaves is looking at Nurse. Whike Nurse is looking at the puck and didn't have some sudden shift of body position that would have made his head the main point of contact.
leafs,lxlxlje,2024-11-17 11:08:32,The Kadri suspension and Debrusk getting nothing is the evidence. The white guy did worse stuff and got nothing the brown guy did less and got suspended for the series.
leafs,lxm73s2,2024-11-17 12:00:53,The brown guy played for the leafs though…I’m brown and I don’t see Kadri suspension being racially motivated. Parros just hates the leafs period - look at Spezza suspension
leafs,lxmm0fp,2024-11-17 13:22:54,His three largest suspensions were Wilson Burrows and GudasOf the 18 players Parros has suspended for 5 games or more only 2 have been persons of colour - Kadri twice.If we extend that down to players suspended for 4 games or more that covers 27 suspensions. And there are still only 2 for a person of colour (the same Kadri two)It has nothing to do with race.
leafs,lxmv1xh,2024-11-17 14:09:51,So 11% of his suspensions have been given to 1% of the players in the league. There's not an equal amount of persons of color in the league. A lot of teams don't even have one player.
leafs,lxn7nuo,2024-11-17 15:17:57,No don't be obtuse. You know you're twisting the numbers.Firstly the NHL is predicted to be about 93%-97% white by best estimates.^[[1]](https://wdet.org/2020/01/17/there-are-only-43-players-of-color-in-the-nhl-three-of-them-play-for-the-red-wings-a-historic-first)[[2]](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/11/09/racism-lingers-for-nhl-players-60-years-after-oree-landmark/38451681/)Nazem Kadri himself is 11% of the top 18 suspensions handed out by Parros but all others in that top 18 are white. If you like at unique offenders Kadri is 1 from a list of 14 that have been suspended more than 5 game - or 7.1% (which lines up with the bottom estimate of 7% PoC NHLers)  ^[[SOURCE]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQMXADOb1-UYH-UkHdXi-sIvimtO-41qdkgleh_sbXWHrtg-1AHRE8pO2pO4OwqwM0oxIIaPbpV11IC/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)Since Parros took over as head of DoPS in 2017 he has issued 205 suspensions.  By my personal count 14 of those have been by players of colour - or 6.8%  And almost all of them were players with history that had been suspended before.(Nazem Kadri Evander Kane Jujhar Khaira Nazem Kadri x2 Evander Kane x2 Evander Kane x3 Ryan Reaves Nazem Kadri x3 Ryan Reaves x2 Evander Kane x4 Darnell Nurse Evander Kane x5 K'Andre Miller Darnell Nurse x2)If we look at unique player counts 159 individual players. Kadri Kane Khaira Reaves Nurse Miller make up 6 unique players and 6/159 is about 3.7% about the other end of our predicted value for racialized players in the NHL.Your only argument is Kadri was suspended and DeBrusk wasn't. That's evidence to the ever growing case of Parros being inept and biased against specific teams. It has nothing to do with race.
leafs,lxle93r,2024-11-17 09:10:18,Edmontons home commenter Jack Michael’s blamed the “poor ice conditions” from the Marlies playing in Scotiabank Arena earlier in the day and how it lead to “four fluky goals—two for each side”What goals were from bad ice conditions?Like the Leafs goals the first was because of McMann’s forecheckthe second was Bouchard’s terrible turnover hitting McDavid and going straight to KniesThe third was just McMann out skating the d-man to the puck (maybe why the puck didn’t keep sliding to Skinner but a better back check it doesn’t happen)and Marner in OT was a good stick stopping Draisaitl’s pass and a rush up ice and good shot.And the Oilers goals was a good pass and deflection from Henrique Shot off Hyman landing on McDavids stick and a McDavid rush to the net and scramble net front where Draisaitl put in the rebound.None of these seem like they happen because of bad ice conditions lol.Tweet link : https://x.com/edmontonjack/status/1857985570586190164?s=61

leafs,lxndv7m,2024-11-17 15:51:03,Clickbait. The cap is expected to go up to 92 next year. This is all hypothetical fantasy nonsense. Also when the Leafs signed the last core 4 contract they had far more cap % tied up in their 4 most expensive forwards than any successful team in the league. Had the cap continued its average of about 1.5 mil per year growth and the pandemic had not happened the Leafs would have had… still far more % tied up in their 5 most expensive forwards than any successful team in the league. The experiment with the core 4 was spending way more money on superstar talents than anyone else. The idea that if not for the pandemic we wouldn’t have been such an insane outlier is a fallacy. Lastly a 120 mil cap wouldn’t mean a team full of superstars it means our 3rd line guys would be making 5-6 mil. Same roster. It’s not like the cap would only go up for us.

leafs,lxm396q,2024-11-17 11:39:43,Thought the Leafs were the better team in the 1st the 2nd was weird for both teams since so much of it was spent on special teams Leafs got an early minor penalty that Edmonton scored on then a full 5 minute major they killed while Edmonton also had to kill a minute long 5-on-3. The 3rd was pretty sleepy from both teams to start imo (pretty sure there was a graphic that said the shots were 2-1 Edmonton like 6 or 7 minutes into the period) but once Bouchard had that brutal giveaway that lead to the Knies goal both teams woke up. Edmonton obviously played desperate in the end but had the refs properly called McDavid for shooting away a Leaf players dropped stick (McDavid essentially created a free PP as the Leaf player skated away from the play to fetch the stick he shot away) the Leafs probably take that in regulation. OT was short. It was McDrai flying in the offensive zone but being lazy to try and get back defensively after a picked-off pass attempt of theirs lead to a Leafs 2-on-1. Marner also had possibly the greatest shift of his career in OT as he made multiple strong defensive plays against McDrai picked off the pass that created the 2-on-1 himself and when everyone assumed he would pass to Tavares on the break he just slid it in the net himself.
leafs,lxmcbuw,2024-11-17 12:29:58,Pretty even game but the Oilers in the 3rd period made some significant defensive mistakes while the Leafs played overall pretty tight and mistake free even during periods of the game where the Oilers were owning the puck.Bouchard for the Oilers had a disastrous 3rd period.

leafs,lxn05u0,2024-11-17 14:36:59,I was told that Talbot was trash from Sens fans too last year lol
leafs,lxomdep,2024-11-17 20:02:45,He just needs to stay healthy for long enough to string together a series of successful games. Consistency is key to building consistency.
leafs,lxk3dk9,2024-11-17 01:31:46,He’s just from *way* upcountry 
leafs,lxq6ycb,2024-11-18 03:14:28,Jack Campbell also went on that hot streak back in November 2021-22 where he had a .959 save percentage. Goalies really are voodoo
leafs,lxk1u0i,2024-11-17 01:18:12,You're misremembering Belfour then.
leafs,lxkckb5,2024-11-17 03:04:55,Potvin gets extra points for being a fucking psycho and dropping the gloves every now and then.
leafs,lxo6n5j,2024-11-17 18:31:00,If I'm being totally honest I don't know much at all about the Leafs history earlier than a couple years ago (when I actually became a serious fan) besides notable playoff performances from the Sundin era so I hedged significantly when I said 20 years lmao
leafs,lxld68h,2024-11-17 09:02:43,Yeah I’m hoping that’s a trade deadline upgradeI was glad he didn’t give up assets last year at the trade deadline because the team clearly wasn’t good enough to have a deep playoff run. This year they look much better and a legit 3C would make them real contenders (if they can avoid choking lol)
leafs,lxnf1lo,2024-11-17 15:57:15,We had multiple holes in our lineup last season. It took him one offseason to fix both our goaltending and defense group when they were shit before. Yea there's still room for improvement but he fixed two major flaws on this team.
leafs,lxk25kr,2024-11-17 01:21:10,Belfour even passed his prime carried us
leafs,lxkvcab,2024-11-17 06:32:29,And Cujo. Guy singlehandedly stole us some playoff series.
leafs,lxlxd7g,2024-11-17 11:07:16,Playoff Belfour was a mythical level goalie that most people seem to forget when my kids are old enough that's the goalie I will measure all new goalies up to.
leafs,lxnpa15,2024-11-17 16:52:26,Did we even have a backup when Eddie was here? I know we did but if you put a gun to my head I couldn't tell you who it was.
leafs,lxl18dd,2024-11-17 07:30:11,I think they mean tandem though. All those guys were great for us but not like they were backed up by an equally talented goalie 
leafs,lxnr2rx,2024-11-17 17:02:14,Belfour also just *looked* good at it. You know? He tended goal the way Nylander skates.
leafs,lxnqrfj,2024-11-17 17:00:29,Depending on the year a combination of JS-Aubin Mikael Tellqvist and Trevor Kidd
leafs,lxllm0y,2024-11-17 09:58:36,Ya true but back then our starter would play like 65-70 games and the era didn’t demand a 1A 1b situation. Todays game seems to want a tandem. Go back and look and basically no team ran a tandem and if they did it was cuz they had 2 mid goalies. The only team I can remember back then that had a decent tandem was SJ when they had Nabokov Kipper and Toskala(before the disaster). And they basically had to trade them cuz teams didn’t really carry 2 legit starters like teams do now. Different time.
hawks,lxtxtoj,2024-11-18 17:28:17,Probably should
hawks,lxu0hs9,2024-11-18 17:42:37,Shannon with a usual level headed take.

hawks,lxu73ka,2024-11-18 18:19:47,Yes
hawks,lxu22t1,2024-11-18 17:51:15,Healthy scratch a veteran in this day and age with no conversation is wild. He's cooked.
hawks,lxu8aag,2024-11-18 18:26:39,I would not be upset. Can't get worse.
hawks,lxu5876,2024-11-18 18:08:59,Whoa take it easy nobody’s that bad
hawks,lxu868h,2024-11-18 18:25:59,What do you want to see happen with the play style with this roster? Defense first play it safe is what we are doing. This team DOES NOT HAVE THE GUYS to try and play river hockey. We will not only not score but get shelled. Our roster is bottom 5 we are playing like a bottom 5 team. A new coach isn’t changing anything.
hawks,lxu5qph,2024-11-18 18:11:56,He's giving it his best shot.
hawks,lxtjrxl,2024-11-18 16:15:53,"From article: ""I was surprised. It was unexpected from the standpoint of I just didn't know I was even close to being in that spot really"" said Hall on Monday. ""If there were some conversations in the days leading up about my game or if I was constantly being shown video that would be one thing. So I was a bit surprised.""He must be pissed if the biggest sports network ESPN is picking this up"
hawks,lxtthgx,2024-11-18 17:05:09,"""If there were some conversations in the days leading up about my game or if I was constantly being shown video that would be one thing. So I was a bit surprised.""How is that lack of communication even acceptable?"
hawks,lxtllav,2024-11-18 16:25:02,They’re clearly trying to send a message to the locker room.  “The Hart Trophy winner former 1st overall isn’t safe and neither are you.”Whether a benching was necessary idk but he was brutal in the last week or so.
hawks,lxtmxac,2024-11-18 16:31:46,Things are starting to stack up against Richardson
hawks,lxtpcqu,2024-11-18 16:44:07,His comments if true just said the coach lost the room. You don't healthy scratch a guy in this day and age without a conversation. Richardson isn't a Stanley cup winning coach he doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. Tell Hall what you want out of him. Better play but specifically. When is Bedard getting sat? I'm starting to worry about the direction now. So what if we have all these lottery tickets sitting in the minors if they aren't developing. Richardson is the problem now. Kyle from Chicago is the next one to go if this doesn't start trending better.
hawks,lxtx2ll,2024-11-18 17:24:16,I mean if this doesn’t scream we need a coaching shift from one of our vet then i don’t know what is
hawks,lxty97s,2024-11-18 17:30:36,I don’t have an issue with him being scratched but none of the coaches expressing any concern to him or you know coaching him beforehand is very concerning to me. Doesn’t seem good for building culture.
hawks,lxu0crp,2024-11-18 17:41:52,Somehow a bunch of other underachievers so far this year like Mikheyev Dickinson Tuevo Bertuzzi ect are immune from even missing a shift. Not sure why a guy coming off a serious injury where he missed almost an entire season is being picked on.
hawks,lxtld0z,2024-11-18 16:23:51,Really hard to understand the rationale for this
hawks,lxtz0ds,2024-11-18 17:34:40,Agreed. Even if you want to send a message. You don't blind side a player I don't care who they are. Communication is key.
hawks,lxu3t94,2024-11-18 18:00:55,This plus the insane line changes reads to me like a team in a tailspin
hawks,lxtnece,2024-11-18 16:34:11,By that logic though does Bedard get benched?  He’s had some really tragic mistakes in the past couple of games.  Whiffing on the dump in at center ice with the net empty in Vancouver which led to the nail in the coffin empty net goal while playing in his hometown was just nuts to watch.
hawks,lxu16xz,2024-11-18 17:46:25,Sure but you don’t pop out of a birthday cake and yell “Surprise! You’re a healthy scratch!” You can send messages without behaving unprofessionally.
hawks,lxtpj7g,2024-11-18 16:45:01,"Were we going to be a bottom 5 team? Almost certainly.  Was there hope we'd be a little better than last year? Yes.  Are we? Definitely not possibly worse.  Is it coaching? I'm not smart enough to answer that but it's easier to fire your coach midseason than it is to improve the roster midseason...  If they don't get significantly better soon he'll be gone after Christmas or the last game before the ""bye week"" in February."
hawks,lxu1p9s,2024-11-18 17:49:11,I would rather have all those prospects staying put in Rockford than bringing them up just to see them regress and lose their confidence.
hawks,lxu4sbt,2024-11-18 18:06:26,I’ll say it again: I won’t be surprised if we learn later on that everyone in that locker room hates Richardson with a burning passion. When it comes to professional athletes who are media trained to death the most important thing is to read between the lines.
hawks,lxtshwr,2024-11-18 17:00:01,Honestly if they want to send a message to the team that there are consequences and we hold *everyone* accountable then yea he absolutely should be benched.  If one of the lower tier guys did some of the things Bedard has done they would of been benched. If they don't and he gets special treatment then I can see that creating issues.
hawks,lxu2m7q,2024-11-18 17:54:14,From Richardson's perspective he might want to scratch him for a game. However win or lose Bedard sells tickets and merch. There might be pressure from ownership to keep him playing which may or may not be the wisest decision.
hawks,lxu1cos,2024-11-18 17:47:18,Honestly yeah he should probably sit for a game.
hawks,lxu50rj,2024-11-18 18:07:48,Yea I thought I was fine with him but things are not trending well
hawks,lxu4zf3,2024-11-18 18:07:34,We are no where near as bad as last year lmao
hawks,lxu2e44,2024-11-18 17:52:59,Agreed. But people need to realize many of these guys may not pan out. I think we all fell for the hype of all of these high picks.
hawks,lxtw2sm,2024-11-18 17:18:55,If you bench players for single mistakes The message you're sending is don't try anything do the most predictable and by the book movement and play every single time
hawks,lxu3aaw,2024-11-18 17:57:56,The current state ain’t panning out either so might as well let them develop a bit.
hawks,lxtxfqs,2024-11-18 17:26:13,I don't think Bedards mistakes are just countable on one hand anymore and has had some pretty big game changing gafs.  I am not sure his mistakes were 'less bad' than what Hall or Kurashev did too but I am still I guess unclear on what they did to get the bench.  I do agree with your statement that it can create an essence of fear around the 'don't try anything fancy'.   I don't know tho maybe they do need to strip their game down and just do simple smart fundamental plays and build off those.
hawks,lxswusj,2024-11-18 14:19:58,How many line combos do we need to try before trying a different offensive system? Can’t wait to see if dump and chase works with these combos
hawks,lxt5ts2,2024-11-18 15:05:16,Bedard with Dickinson is honestly fine and good with me Anderson though I’m struggling to understand.
hawks,lxsy2zm,2024-11-18 14:26:07,Different lines same offensive system.
hawks,lxt6z5f,2024-11-18 15:11:11,98 17 86 was the only combo that had zip to it so far
hawks,lxt7q5x,2024-11-18 15:15:05,Bertuzzi has been such a disappointment…I was very happy with his signing and expected a Domi-like performance.
hawks,lxt60jp,2024-11-18 15:06:15,Dickinson might be ok I guess but put another skill guy on the other wing not Anderson
hawks,lxswgzi,2024-11-18 14:18:03,At some point just bring up the young guys and see what we have.  Who cares about burning a year.  Lets see what we have.  This team has a lot of cap and if they do not bring in a stud to help this off season.  Also Is Richardson really the guy?  Bring in a better coach at least 1 stud and a couple young guys up next season and see what we have.  Mixing lines is fun and all but hes killing any chance at chemistry except line 4 which has been fun to watch.  Reichel is really looking like he has stepped it up.

hawks,lxten42,2024-11-18 15:50:11,Can’t score goals so best to leave Anderson in the line up and AA in Rockford.
hawks,lxto7zh,2024-11-18 16:38:21,There is still not a whole lot of skill on this team. Only so much they can do. I know Richardson is a popular target but despite a few mid tier FA signings this team wasn’t exactly ready to make things interesting this year. It’s easy to get impatient now that we have Bedard but we need a true Robin to his Batman. Maybe this offseason we’ll snag a better FA. But it’s still going to be another year or two for the young guys.
hawks,lxsw3nv,2024-11-18 14:16:11,I dont hate it
hawks,lxsy3gi,2024-11-18 14:26:11,Nothing surprises me anymore with this team!
hawks,lxtfwxv,2024-11-18 15:56:31,Just give us reichel bedard teuvo
hawks,lxtg5pw,2024-11-18 15:57:44,Reichel’s got the most jump on the team and we’re playing him in no man’s land
hawks,lxtkic0,2024-11-18 16:19:35,Feel bad for Turbo coming into this mess
hawks,lxttrzt,2024-11-18 17:06:41,Is all of this movement just favoritism of a coach with severe mood swings?
hawks,lxu1zel,2024-11-18 17:50:44,I don't mind putting Bedard with Dickinson but tbh it should be on the 3rd line. Every other player has been up and down the line ups and Bedard has not played well the last few games. It might do him well to get 3rd line minutes for a game.
hawks,lxu4q94,2024-11-18 18:06:06,Straight Dogshit
hawks,lxtavzq,2024-11-18 15:31:15,Team looked great in the first period against the Canucks. Probably just need to stick with it.
hawks,lxsz764,2024-11-18 14:31:43,Well we don't play a dump and chase system so I'm not sure what you're watching. We play a dump change and one guy sorta thinks about chasing system where we just give the other team the puck and hope for the best. We basically play like we are running the clock out while up 3 all game longer no matter what. It's trash
hawks,lxu1nsc,2024-11-18 17:48:58,I won't complain about his skills in cleaning up garbage in front of them net but he is...so...fucking...slooooow. I don't know if he just doesn't give a shit or if this is actually his top speed.
hawks,lxtq42r,2024-11-18 16:47:56,My guess is the goal is to really simplify things for Bedard and allow him to be more attack focused? Nothing is working lately so why not do some crazy blender at this point. Unless we start getting shut out every game it can't get worse.
hawks,lxszbjp,2024-11-18 14:32:19,Remove Richardson before you bring a guy up. I'm honestly not sure what team in the NHL would succeed with our turtle and dump and chase only strategy in the modern game
hawks,lxt1qca,2024-11-18 14:44:32,>At some point just bring up the young guys and see what we have.That some point will be a year or two. They will benefit from developing in Rockford not getting thrown to the wolves in the chel with this mess.

hawks,lxswzph,2024-11-18 14:20:39,I want what you’re smoking putting Anderson with Bedard in my opinion is stupid.
hawks,lxtw1cg,2024-11-18 17:18:41,Yeah dump and chase actually works when the team actually cares
hawks,lxu1ygt,2024-11-18 17:50:36,I feel like moving him to wing with Dickinson does that. Give him another player who can play with him put hall kurshy or even Tuevo there instead of Joey.
hawks,lxu8lp4,2024-11-18 18:28:31,At this point with this sub I want to see a new coach that runs and guns so when we lose 7-1 every game I can say I told you so
hawks,lxtm136,2024-11-18 16:27:14,The wolves actually are AHL. They just played Rockford the other day
hawks,lxt3j3l,2024-11-18 14:53:37,I wonder if the thought process revolves who Bedard is often playing against. Basically if teams want to match Bedard against their best lines then their best lines have to play against two of our best shutdown forwards. Anderson is still a weird one to see on the top line but I'm down to give it a shot. Dickinson and Anderson can open the ice up and it forces Bedard to have the shoot first mentality.
hawks,lxt3p30,2024-11-18 14:54:28,There’s 11 other forward that also hop over the boards. Sometimes balance plus a tweaked team game is what you need to get back to basics and win some close games and play great D. Not saying it will work but we have seen stars play with subpar linemates since the dawn of hockey its all about how they can compliment each other. I too wish we had a better team but we gotta work with what we have.
hawks,lxsyjqk,2024-11-18 14:28:27,I feel like swap Hall and Anderson and it would be fine
hawks,lxu331b,2024-11-18 17:56:49,Maybe if you have the right players that can win the board battles. We don't have that. How many good teams in the league are actually choosing to dump and chase as the primary stategy over skating the puck in to gain the zone while retaining possession?
hawks,lxt37t1,2024-11-18 14:52:01,That’d be fine with me. Honestly its not even the first line i care about. I like the balance here through 4 lines even though its a bit odd.
hawks,lxs9ebq,2024-11-18 12:22:33,He was perfectly fine as a “bridge” coach but he’s doesn’t seem to be the guy to develop our young players to the next level especially Bedard. I’m sure he’ll see out the season but I really hope Kyle makes a switch soon. If we’re gonna be a bad team let’s at least get a guy in who can actually coach the players and enhance their development.Edit: I do think he’s done a good job with the young d men we have but he then has in place this defensive system that invites punishment and does more harm than good imo. It’s also costing us offensive development.
hawks,lxsc83z,2024-11-18 12:36:42,I thought Luke was a fine coach until this season. But what has become obvious this year is he doesn’t yet know how to handle skill players. Granted the Hawks don’t have an elite roster but it’s much more skilled than last year. The line juggling has been very poor and isn’t giving the players a chance to marinate in them. He’s looking for a lightning in a bottle with each combo and thats not how it works.Players need to execute a game plan. That’s 100% on the roster. But what is currently happening is 10-12 guys all underachieving every game. And that’s a hard coincidence to swallow.
hawks,lxsg0mr,2024-11-18 12:55:34,Guy hates offense
hawks,lxsh3sa,2024-11-18 13:00:59,"I liked him last year but he's made choices this year that I can't wrap my head around. My main gripe is the juggling of lines. He initially said he broke Bedard & Kurashev up because Bedard ""can score with anyone"" and its obvious thats not the case for either of them - at least not at the level they had together last season. If its not broken don't fix it. Not giving these guys a chance to settle into a rhythm with a consistent line sets them up for failure imo."
hawks,lxsbcn3,2024-11-18 12:32:20,We have a young GM a young superstar a shit team and a first time coach… not really a great recipe for success. Somethings gotta give and we ain’t moving Bedard.
hawks,lxs73gx,2024-11-18 12:10:58,I still like Him but the ultra defensive turnover game we're playing is boring and not helping win games with this roster. It benefits Reichel but almost no other offensive players time to adapt or get gone.
hawks,lxscrgu,2024-11-18 12:39:23,I've been saying it is time for him to go for a bit now. I honestly don't care at all what our record is or how many points we have that's completely irrelevant. We won't be good this year and we are not one new coach away from a playoff team.With that said: We cannot be wasting years of development playing an outdated dump and chase pass to nowhere no emphasis on puck posssession style of hockey. It doesn't help develop any of our players for that next step.From the intangeble aspect of it. It is wild to me how unprepared the team looks day in and day out. We waste 20-40 minutes every game before making even the smallest of adjustments. That cannot be happening in the NHL. The good though I'll say is that a lot of the team's underlying metrics are better. The PP is much better the PK has been okay too. He is doing some things right for sure. I just don't think building a team that plays prevent-style like they are holding a lead is good long-term for anyone's development. The goal isn't to win games today the goal needs to be getting the young guys to play the right way and be aggressive to win tomorrow
hawks,lxs8jzf,2024-11-18 12:18:18,I like him as a person but I think it might be time for a change
hawks,lxsce74,2024-11-18 12:37:33,I’m getting sick of his defense first dump and chase zero puck possession system it makes for Boring ass hockey and is nearly impossible to create any offense with a roster like this
hawks,lxsofs5,2024-11-18 13:37:54,I wouldn't be surprised if he's fired during the season. There seems to be a bit of a growing rift between him and Kyle Davidson. Davidson signed a bunch of veterans including a couple of top-6 guys. Davidson said this team needs to be more competitive which is why he signed a bunch of vets instead of calling up the young guys. But after the Vancouver game Richardson said something to the effect that the Blackhawks don't have enough goid players who are willing to work hard at the net. It just seemed like something more critical of the roster building than we'd normally see. So they clearly have different perspectives on the quality of players on the roster.Wouldn't be surprised too if ownership is putting pressure on Davidson and Richardson to win more games now and speed up the rebuild in which case Richardson will be the fall guy if/when they're still in last place in January.
hawks,lxskwxz,2024-11-18 13:20:16,He has us playing like we’re always protecting a 3 goal lead but doesn’t have an offensive system that’s capable of generating 3 goals. I think it’s time for a change but it probably doesn’t happen until next year
hawks,lxsfmvk,2024-11-18 12:53:39,The blender constantly going is what has me getting there.  Obviously you want to find who has chemistry but you also want players to have consistency so they can figure out some intricacies of their linemates game.
hawks,lxs72x1,2024-11-18 12:10:53,The majority of us here(or a loud and significant minority) are done with him lol. They don’t play a full 60 minutes there’s no urgency and the game plan of dump and chase just isn’t working regardless of what the lines are. This comes down to coaching. Nobody expects a good team. But we have to see some improvement and better effort.
hawks,lxsfqc0,2024-11-18 12:54:08,I'm beyond done. And today's lines are just WTF??Had one of the or was it the worst GPG average last year at like 2.2 goals per game. Heading there again this year. He has no idea how to create offense. Hawks need to move on.
hawks,lxshpd6,2024-11-18 13:04:02,The team is getting no better and it could be argued that it is getting worse. They have more talent than what they have shown  (although it's not a good team) and Bedard seems to be affected by the whole deal. Yes I'm kinda done with him.
hawks,lxsolq3,2024-11-18 13:38:44,Source: Ben pope “ Blackhawks' forward lines in practice today — they keep getting wackier: line 1: Bedard-Dickinson-Anderson Line2: Teravainen-Foligno-Kurashev Line 3: Hall- Donato-MikheyevLine4: Bertuzzi-  Reichel-Smith *Maroon rotating”
hawks,lxsjvab,2024-11-18 13:15:00,Honestly I’ve never been for it but after seeing the lineup today and seeing that hall was surprised to be cut I’m about ready to hop on the fire Richardson train.
hawks,lxsmohc,2024-11-18 13:29:03,I’ve been done with him for a while. The lack of scoring irritates me to no end the heavy defensive play would be great if this were 2002 the line juggling hasn’t worked out and some games he just doesn’t seem to have any motivation. They just need someone who can let Bedard be himself and go off on the ice. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he stays around the whole season.
hawks,lxtmst0,2024-11-18 16:31:07,I wouldn’t mind if Q came back. But I could see why others might find a problem with it
hawks,lxsd78h,2024-11-18 12:41:34,he was dealt some difficult cards his first two years but the fact of the matter is that our plan for this season is just about over at this point. the team playing better and insulating connor bedard and allowing him to shine and grow just hasn’t happened this season. the fact that so many folks are calling for davidson to deviate from the plan to call up nazar or someone from rockford just proves that things are completely off the rails offensively at this point i think we could see a change in coaching this season if things continue to slide. davidson preaches patience but i wonder when things become too detrimental to our young guys development (bedard reichel etc) i also think it’s important to keep in mind that a coaching change likely won’t result in vastly better position in the standings but rather a philosophical and developmental change which is what this team needs.
hawks,lxsdo2a,2024-11-18 12:43:53,https://x.com/BenPopeCST/status/1858559780379402525?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5EtweetEven Luke is done with Luke at this point.
hawks,lxs7thy,2024-11-18 12:14:37,seems like a nice guy but alex vlasic is the only young guy who has improved at all. frankly the present situation with bedard's progess is terrifying. big thumbs down for luke right now.
hawks,lxshn3m,2024-11-18 13:03:42,This bum has to go. The lines in lractice todag oday is the rotten cherry on the shit cake that is his coaching. Tried to make every line a dump and chase line changes line combos between every single game hasn't even tried bertuzzi-bedard-teravainen and wonders why there's no cohesion or offensive production. He's completely incompetent. It's like having a Bears head coach
hawks,lxs93v6,2024-11-18 12:21:05,Richardson's tenure as the Blackhawks' head coach has been a masterclass in underachievement.
hawks,lxsqwgh,2024-11-18 13:50:16,The biggest issue I see is the lack of transition. Our forwards are constantly playing below the dots and we can’t get 2 or 3 man rushes because of the distance. We need a better scheme at this point.
hawks,lxt7bbb,2024-11-18 15:12:56,Thankfully the hawks aren’t in as bad shape as Nashville (considering expectations). And I don’t think anyone serious considered them to climb out of the bottom 10 in the NHL. But I think there were clear expectations that they’d be better than they are. When teams are in an underperformance rut like this it’s usually team chemistry or coaching to blame. Something has got to give. I wouldn’t expect a coaching change to happen until the off-season though (if that’s the plan).
hawks,lxtfk8j,2024-11-18 15:54:45,I still like Luke he’s not the reason that some of these guys can’t find it within themselves to give a shit.  However I don’t like what he’s been doing with the lines lately.  Lines need time to gel the line juggling does no one any favors.  The line that’s played together the most this year is the 4th line and what do you know it’s one of the best lines the team has right now.
hawks,lxtotfi,2024-11-18 16:41:22,The constant changing of lines.. Then throw them out there for a period.. Oh not working? Change them again.. Like fuck it takes more than a period to develop chemistry..
hawks,lxtow62,2024-11-18 16:41:46,Seems like he's lost the room. Don't think it will happen but I would love to see Boudreau come in.
hawks,lxts951,2024-11-18 16:58:46,Yep. Only Detroit scored less goals than the Hawks and they’ve only played 17 games (one less than the Hawks). He has taken us back to the early 2000s.
hawks,lxu4nkv,2024-11-18 18:05:41,I genuinely believe he is killing Bedard's potential. The touted generational talent is on pace for 14 goals this year...
hawks,lxs7s6b,2024-11-18 12:14:25,Been done the team plays with the same energy he shows on his face every day.
hawks,lxsycjw,2024-11-18 14:27:27,"""There isnt much we can do.""I'll never respect him as a coach after that quote. He's in over his head.The Hawks players loved Savard but he had to go to move the team forward. History needs to repeat."
hawks,lxsdfpj,2024-11-18 12:42:43,"Whats that old quote? ""Its hard to soar with the eagles if your surrounded by turkeys"". Lets face it Scotty Bowman or Al Arbour couldnt milk much more out of this sad roster of bad NHL players.."
hawks,lxssuy9,2024-11-18 13:59:55,I think he’s a fantastic developmental coach. He’s very good at getting players with major issues in their game confident and productive. Look at his track record so far with how his team has worked wonders in meh players:LaffertyDickinsonMcCabeMrazekOur prospects have done well learning under him too. Vlasic and Anderson really showed themselves to be excellent young players under him after being rather under the radar prospects. Vlasic himself is probably our most complete defenceman as he has the fantastic shutdown game of Jones with a very strong offensive mindset to go with it. I also think Bedard has learned a lot of the skills that will make him one of the best players in the league and the total package first line center. The way Richardson has taught him how to pick his battles on offence use his teammates and actually play good defence has really shown. Say what you want about his stats or how he isn’t a stand out defensive player but the guy has gotten so much better at just staying in the defensive play and keeping those opposing forwards from attacking the middle of the ice. He clearly knows development and he’s damn good at it. But unless he adapts with this team he needs to be out the door this January. He has zero idea how to structure this team to succeed. We don’t have the four line grinder team we had last year dump and chase isn’t gonna work because our top guys are not gonna be able to consistently break in. We need strategies that take advantage of our puck carriers and very mobile defence core kinda like what Buffalo has.All our defence can skate really well and we have multiple guys who can find that long range pass very easy and when even Seth Jones can lead a break in decently well that’s a massively dumb decision to not take advantage of it. The fact that on a team with Hall Reichel Bedard Teuvo and 3 big ass defence who are really good skaters and long range passers are regrouping for a dump and chase EVERY. SINGLE. PLAY. is the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen since Toronto’s defence core being as soft as they were under Sheldon Keefe. This team has the skill to cause quick turnovers and send skilled players on rushes. Hell we have guys who can make highlight reel plays on our third line. There is no reason we aren’t doing that strategy.On that note also why don’t our defence lay big hits? They will see a player on the boards and just let him in the zone why? Almost our entire defence core this year has built a reputation for being physical players. Nolan Allan especially is well known for absolutely killing people with their head down so why aren’t our defence encouraged to do that? Our defence are plenty strong enough to shut down almost any player cutting into the zone hell we even saw Jones and Vlasic man handling MacKinnon after his rush goal in the Colorado game. If they can do that to one of the strongest forwards in hockey they can take that physicality to putting their shoulder through rushing forwards in bad positions. This team is being built to be punishing and hella fast. Look at our prospect pool for fuck sake. The amount of size and speed in that pool is insane and yet the beginning pieces to that future team are being taught to not take risks or punish poor positioning. Also our powerplay doesn’t fit our roster whatsoever. We should be using a shooting or 1-3-1 preferably shooting because it would let us have 3 shot options at any given time letting Bedard who is our primary sniper shift positioning into wherever he wants. It also would allow a speedy battler like Reichel to be able to quickly use the area down low to swap the side that the puck is on and allow Bedard to sneak into a spot he’s not expected to be in. Plus it would let us take full advantage of Vlasic or Jones on that first powerplay as they have more space to pass or shoot as they want and it would allow two men back if we ever lost the puck instead of one. The team is designed in a way this powerplay would work yet we use the umbrella powerplay while also rarely having Bedard touch the puck. It’s a joke.He needs to understand this team has the skill to make skilled plays we don’t need to regroup before every play. Take risks lay hits and set up a powerplay that has less low zone coverage and more high zone shooting opportunities so that our stud top line center can use that unique shot of his to pick through screens like he is well known for doing. This would work even better since we have 2 players well known for being money near the net in Teuvo and Bertuzzi to create some carnage after the shot.
hawks,lxscw5h,2024-11-18 12:40:02,I’m hoping we can lure Brad Berry from North Dakota. Would be a great coach to develop the young players and has a winning background.
hawks,lxshwkd,2024-11-18 13:05:02,Yes I'm over him. I have been for a year now.
hawks,lxt0th7,2024-11-18 14:39:55,Flus and him are kissing cousins on the way out of town. Good God can these teams find a half decent coach??!!
hawks,lxt625z,2024-11-18 15:06:29,He’s coaching like he’s winning games and benching players left and right for poor performance. But the issue is he isn’t winning games and he needs to be benched too for poor coaching performance
hawks,lxtezwu,2024-11-18 15:51:56,I've been thinking about it. I do not see any player development happening which is the whole point of this horrible season. And I'm so tired of watching this dump-and-chase thing. Maybe it is time
hawks,lxto6hz,2024-11-18 16:38:08,I haven't liked him from the get-go so I guess it's hard to be done with something you never wanted in the first place.
hawks,lxtwdib,2024-11-18 17:20:31,He needs to go last season
hawks,lxu4j5w,2024-11-18 18:04:59,Lol the issue is Davidson not Richardson. They have Bedard and what else at forward.  If Hall was still the player he once was Boston doesn't let him walk same goes for Teuvo.
hawks,lxspulp,2024-11-18 13:45:02,Not yet. I think a lot of people saw the signings we made in free agency and got they’re hopes up. We were always going to be a bottom 5 team this season but I saw so many people thinking we’d be in the wildcard race. We’ve been staying in games until the end for the most part and that’s about all we can ask for with this roster.
hawks,lxszmj8,2024-11-18 14:33:52,He’s literally ruining a generational talent
hawks,lxsjjw1,2024-11-18 13:13:24,Losing races losing puck battles and not going to hard areas is on the players at the end of the day. Richardson hasn’t helped by putting together questionable lines but effort for the full 60 is not something a coach is magically going to overcome. We need a true 1C until Bedard is up to NHL pace we need a true 1D who can play a quality 25 min a night we need scoring support on our top two lines and we need a dedicated defensive center on line 3/4 who can shut down top-end talent. This team is full of holes and as much as I’d love to see a shift I think the team has more issues than coaching alone can fix
hawks,lxsoz3a,2024-11-18 13:40:36,I'm so comfortable letting him finish out this season. If I'm making a change right now I'm looking at my options in place of Derek King
hawks,lxt88wz,2024-11-18 15:17:46,The thing I will never understand is why the Chicago Blackhawks thought a guy with Richardson’s track record would be a good fit. There was literally no reason to give him the job in the first place
hawks,lxsaq5g,2024-11-18 12:29:12,I wonder what the new CBA will look like? With the salary cap going up will they address the fact teams can pay more to keep their players as it is now? Meaning why on earth would Bedard stay on our team if the lottery tickets don't pan out and he's literally had 15 different linemates when we have had unlimited money essentially to get him at least one top player.  I want to trust Kyle from Chicago but prospects are just that.
hawks,lxstloi,2024-11-18 14:03:42,The hawks need another top end player.  Someone to take some pressure off bedard to feel like he has to make play after play...a mentor type that leads by example.  Thought it was Hall but he is cooked.     I do like what he has done with the line with reichel but helping bedard has been a major defect in his coaching.  They need another top end player.  Bring in a new coach and bring in someone like: roslovic kuzmenko or a huge splash with a guy like kiril marner or rantanen.
hawks,lxtaonl,2024-11-18 15:30:12,Yeah I’m done we’ve regressed again in key areas. Bedard and the young core look pretty annoyed and rightly so. Time to go.
hawks,lxshpml,2024-11-18 13:04:04,All the young dmen did their developing with Sorensen in Rockford
hawks,lxsg5le,2024-11-18 12:56:14,After his first season as a coach it seemed obvious he has no idea how to deal with young players period. He clearly is more comfortable with vets and our core is young. Time to go.
hawks,lxt0twq,2024-11-18 14:39:58,The guy couldnt develop someone out of a wet paper bag. A career so far unmarred by success.But what is scarier is how much regression is happening under him. Forget Bedard for a moment have you seen Teravainen lately? The guy has succeeded everywhere he has been until he ran into this fraud of a coach. What is he at 1 point in 13 games or something?I wouldnt be surprised if the players revolt on him.
hawks,lxu3f6a,2024-11-18 17:58:42,Bedard should be on the wing I’ll die on this hill
hawks,lxsdf6x,2024-11-18 12:42:39,Same.  I was even sure he would be a good coach until this year.
hawks,lxsqjz0,2024-11-18 13:48:33,The line blender is maddening.
hawks,lxso04m,2024-11-18 13:35:42,This whirlwind of line tinkering ti's fuckign terrible. Not only every game but mid game. It's  not allowing players to develop any chemistry. That'd truly bad coaching
hawks,lxsqeuh,2024-11-18 13:47:50,I'm really frustrated that we are playing so much dump and chase. We've been drafting high quality skaters not guys who get into the corners and dig out pucks at a high success rate. The young guys on the team need to be getting reps of an offensive scheme that plays to their strengths. We are drafting for a team that controls possession earns clean zone entries and uses those to set up high quality chances. Richardson seems to want to play a physical dump and chase get pucks to the net for gritty goals kind of game.
hawks,lxt1r6d,2024-11-18 14:44:39,Reminds me of a certain hawks coach who said “it’s not about the combos!” In defense of his frequent line shuffling. 
hawks,lxt5y6a,2024-11-18 15:05:54,I’m starting to think the players hate it too tbh.
hawks,lxt2ayu,2024-11-18 14:47:26,They were scoring because they both cheated defensively over and over which is how they ended up with decent scoring while being one of the actually worst performing lines in hockey. Richardson isnt letting them do it any more (though I still see it from both from time to time still) but that doesnt excuse the other problems with generating offense.
hawks,lxstql8,2024-11-18 14:04:24,Even Reichel it doesn’t really benefit. I like his battle he has in his game but this strategy has sapped him of any of that peripheral passing drive by tipping of pucks coming at the defence with speed and that quick turnover game that got him drafted here. This strategy is turning him into an excellent two way forward but we really need his playmaking game for the future and he’s just not getting the opportunity to show it.
hawks,lxt56fz,2024-11-18 15:01:56,"It's an offense first game and 1 goal per game average ain't cutting it. His ""system"" doesn't work in this NHL. Time to cut him lose."
hawks,lxsr2h6,2024-11-18 13:51:05,It’s not even just dumping the puck in… they don’t even forecheck. I live in south Florida and watch a fair bit of Panthers hockey and they frequently dump the puck in but they forecheck ferociously and get puck possession that way. The Hawks seem to dump and then send one guy against 2-3 with the rest retreating.
hawks,lxt3cbs,2024-11-18 14:52:40,Other than Coach Q who is off limits for this org who is out there that would be an upgrade?  What top coach would come in approaching midseason?  If attendance drops with continued bad play along with the bad TV vibes it might happen.
hawks,lxsytt4,2024-11-18 14:29:51,I watched that and to me it seemed more like a comment on the lack of motivation from many of the players (and personally I look to the captain and alternate captains for that) vs rift between Davidson and Richardson. They both knew they were limited this year to whatever was available in the UFA class.
hawks,lxt2k34,2024-11-18 14:48:42,This right here . We are playing like we are trying to hold on to a lead by playing ultra conservative defense first hockey even though we’re the ones losing by 1 or 2 goals. Or when we’re up 1-0 they just stop playing offense and try to hold on to a 1 goal lead. It’s ludicrous 
hawks,lxsa3xj,2024-11-18 12:26:06,The lack of urgency is the biggest issue for surefor me that's a clear sign of a lack of authority at the toptotally different sport but look at the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA right now. They have one of the world's best players and a solid team from top to bottom but they're currently sitting at 4-9 because they just look so lifeless and uninterested if they're down early. To me that's a clear sign that they don't give a fuck because their coach doesn't give a fuck
hawks,lxt03px,2024-11-18 14:36:18,Does it even matter? They last about three seconds in the game anyways.
hawks,lxt33ps,2024-11-18 14:51:27,100%. Making bedard play conservative defense first hockey doesn’t give him a chance to use his skill and offensive creativity. It’s painful to see
hawks,lxso077,2024-11-18 13:35:43,Finally Bedard on Dickinson's wing

hawks,lxsp0xy,2024-11-18 13:40:52,Bertuzzi and Bedard seem like such an obvious tandem to me. I don't understand why he won't give them any time to develop some chemistry.

hawks,lxtn4m0,2024-11-18 16:32:49,Hawks were at a very different point when they fired Savard for Q. This team isn't near that point yet but I do feel a change coming even if it's after the season unless they make King interim again.
hawks,lxsd7qt,2024-11-18 12:41:39,Always leery of college coaches j the NHL. I'm not overly familiar with his body of work  though I know it's a highly respected program.
hawks,lxsyp7s,2024-11-18 14:29:13,I didn’t think we’d be winning but nobody is even producing. I love danato and hopefully he becomes a stud but he is not supposed to be leading this roster in goals.
hawks,lxsy2bc,2024-11-18 14:26:01,But most of the issues people are mentioning here have nothing to do with our record. We are going to have a bad record no matter what and I don't think anyone is arguing that. This is Colliton where he lost 10 in a row with a team people thought could make the playoffs. The system sucks the kids are developing and he seems in way over his head. Why keep him?
hawks,lxtbym5,2024-11-18 15:36:42,Chicago teams love taking the unproven new guy for cheap and hoping to get lucky instead of just going out and getting a proven guy like harbaugh.
hawks,lxu2sdc,2024-11-18 17:55:11,Not entirely true. Vlasic has improved quite a bit since getting to the NHL level. Kaiser as well. I think we can shit on Richardson without being totally unfair like this comment does giving him zero credit to the improvement we do see from some guys.
hawks,lxt2usn,2024-11-18 14:50:13,Hawks players revolting against their coach they call that doing a Duncan Keith
hawks,lxswu2u,2024-11-18 14:19:52,I don’t think he’s looked at the size of our guys for a dump-in style of rush. There’s a reason Q developed a great entry with Kaner that was a consistent entry onside.
hawks,lxsumt1,2024-11-18 14:08:51,Minus the physical part.
hawks,lxt4922,2024-11-18 14:57:17,We all appreciate you not saying his name.
hawks,lxssftf,2024-11-18 13:57:50,Dump it in have one guy half-hazardly skate to the corner and not be a threat at all and let the other 4 go change. Rinse and repeat all game long and wonder why we lost
hawks,lxstwev,2024-11-18 14:05:12,Ironically Davidson has been drafting speedy high-compete guys who could do great in that kind of system--Nazar Ludwinski Moore etc . . .  these are the kind of players who could make it work.
hawks,lxt5qtx,2024-11-18 15:04:50,Darryl Sutter Alain Vigneault Gerard Gallant Todd McLellan to name a fewRealistically if they fired Richardson mid-season they would just get an assistant or Anders Sorensen from Rockford to be the interim before getting a permanent replacement. And with Bedard Levshunov Nazar Korchinski Vlasic etc as a young core next season I think potential coaches would be lining up at the chance to coach them.
hawks,lxtg8dp,2024-11-18 15:58:06,Same.  That’s a public calling out of the players they’re not doing their jobs.  The systems the Blackhawks play aren’t complicated any player can do it.  They just don’t execute.  Kyle said earlier in the season that record doesn’t indicate everything and he’s seen a definite improvement so far.
hawks,lxsbryt,2024-11-18 12:34:28,So the Hawks are solid from top to bottom and all they need is a better coach?
hawks,lxt9qys,2024-11-18 15:25:27,It reminds me so much of when Ducharme was head coach in Montreal and Caulfield was being held back then all of a sudden he’s been great since St. Louis took over. That’s what the Hawks need
hawks,lxt0jlf,2024-11-18 14:38:31,Looking forward to this too!
hawks,lxt2uqi,2024-11-18 14:50:13,Cause that can possibly create offense and god forbid the hawks play offensive and don’t focus on defense only in Luke’s point of view 
hawks,lxtqlzg,2024-11-18 16:50:26,Then maybe its time for Savard! Bring back the spinorama!But 100% serious for a moment Savard would do a better job developing Bedard and the other forwards here even if he would stink at everything else.
hawks,lxt9tum,2024-11-18 15:25:51,I wouldn’t be surprised if a few years down the line word came out that every single player in this roster hated Richardson’s guts.
hawks,lxsv9q5,2024-11-18 14:12:02,Yeah I mean we're not actually playing physically we're just trying to execute a gameplan that requires us to be
hawks,lxt7wlk,2024-11-18 15:16:00,Good to hear this.  Not sure about Sutter though as I think he’s happy farming.
hawks,lxscbxv,2024-11-18 12:37:15,no that's not what i'm saying at alli'm saying the listlessness of the Hawks...the buck falls on those at the top. If it can impact one of the better teams (on paper) it would absolutely also impact any other team.
hawks,lxt1ywf,2024-11-18 14:45:44,They played decently well together last season in a handful of games.
hawks,lxsfl23,2024-11-18 12:53:25,They playing a full on defensive turtle style = boring to watch.  Also Levshunov is garbage
hawks,lxtm0w0,2024-11-18 16:27:12,What I enjoy about these two are that they put everything they have out there on the ice every shift (even though turnovers are committed sometimes) It makes a positive mental impact when you’re someone like that and working with others who match your effort
hawks,lxsjuo7,2024-11-18 13:14:55,I agree with your first part but I don't think anyone can be calling the 19 year old defensive prospect with 9 AHL games under his belt garbage
hawks,lxr61kq,2024-11-18 08:43:41,Nice write-up...Gramps was an  awesome hockey player. Definitely agree the Hawks should retire his jersey. Deserves to be in the Hall as well.
hawks,lxr79fh,2024-11-18 08:51:37,Great write up.Steve Larmer was always one of my favorite Hawks. Not the biggest not the flashiest but always in the right place at the right time. Power play penalty kill even strength. Effective in all situations of the game.He had a bit of a funky skating style if you watched him. You would think he was slow and awkward but he wasn't. Just very efficient.It was a shame he had to go to the Rangers to win a Cup but Mike Keenan knew he could count on him. I'm pretty sure he was on the ice at the end of the Cup clinching game. He certainly deserved that moment.
hawks,lxrhpag,2024-11-18 09:56:00,I have been a lifelong Blackhawks fan I worked at the UC for 5 years selling merchandise.  I own one Blackhawks sweater an autographed 1990-1991 Steve Larmer jersey with the All-Star patch.  Never needed another one when I already had the best.
hawks,lxrk77k,2024-11-18 10:10:18,The stadium was an awesome place to watch a game.
hawks,lxrkk1o,2024-11-18 10:12:21,Yes sir.
hawks,lxrmxdg,2024-11-18 10:25:34,The Party Line.  Although Savvy was my favorite Hawk of that era Larmer is the heart of every true Hawks fan that was watching the club at that time.  Skilled gritty and tough as hell.
hawks,lxsm8zj,2024-11-18 13:26:56,Wish I was alive to experience a game at the old stadium.
hawks,lxq174e,2024-11-18 02:12:43,Would the crypto fascist-mods object to   coming here to complain that the BLACKHAWKS may only be the 3rd worst Chicago team currently playing?  They   surely have a better coach than the terribly run BEARS and BULLS flop out every game. Has there ever been a 'year'(seasons) where 3 of 5 Chicago teams (4 of 6 with SKY) all fired their coach?  This should be it.  But not the Blackhawks.   So there's that and   Conor Bedard to smile about Hawks fans.      Go BLACKHAWKS!!
hawks,lxslch4,2024-11-18 13:22:24,This message is for Luke Richardson only if you are not him please scrolling. Luke. I am bringing my girlfriend to the game tomorrow. These are our anniversary tickets. I went out of my way to get 100 level seats. if you fucking start Connor Bedard on a line with Jason Dickinson and JOEY FUCKING ANDERSON mark my words it is over for you.
hawks,lxp50hw,2024-11-17 21:57:45,Rockford as a whole just looked horrible tonight from start to finish. 
hawks,lxp69if,2024-11-17 22:05:47,I thought u were talking about the train line
hawks,lxp8dy1,2024-11-17 22:19:33,Just saw the highlights. Yep d man is like a 5 year apprenticeship.  It’s why they get paid
hawks,lxp7sre,2024-11-17 22:15:44,"We have alot of "" prospects"" hopefully some of them pan out otherwise it's gonna be a long time before we make the playoffs much less hoist a cup."
hawks,lxrj83o,2024-11-18 10:04:46,Duncan keith was a -8 in his first year at norfolk
hawks,lxp6c0l,2024-11-17 22:06:15,Sadly he hasn’t looked great all year
hawks,lxq51u4,2024-11-18 02:53:46,I’ve watched him play in real life in college… I didn’t see anything game breaking. I honestly think this pick could be the worst that the KD team has made and it could come back to kill the rebuild. I’d have loved to draft either Demidov or Buuim. But that’s just me and time will tell. He’s going to be a project for sure.
hawks,lxpakpx,2024-11-17 22:34:04,Oh shit I had no idea that there was an AHL team that played at the Allstate Arena (the Wolves).
hawks,lxs2nvn,2024-11-18 11:48:25,Hope so! He’s got a great attitude would love to see him succeed here
hawks,lxsiyfo,2024-11-18 13:10:23,The Hogs look as bad as the Hawks.
hawks,lxpi82b,2024-11-17 23:27:27,my buddy was at the game and said he looked horrible... like he had the hockey IQ of an 8 year old to be specific
hawks,lxp7b3j,2024-11-17 22:12:32,Unfortunately sure I was all in on DEMIDOV & Cold Eisermav but hopefully Levshunov pans out
hawks,lxr017r,2024-11-18 08:02:22,Cam Barker 2.0
hawks,lxp9040,2024-11-17 22:23:37,Exactly this. Prospects are lottery tickets. I'd like to see some transition to trading some for proven second or third line players. Jordan didn't win squat until the home run second tier role guys got defined. Bedard is taking a step back because he's had like 15 different line mates since starting. It's sorta scary that with all the space and money we don't have a solid top line.
hawks,lxpbrld,2024-11-17 22:42:08,Lost 4-0 so I suppose any sight of a competent goalie is out of the question?  Go Blackhawks!!
hawks,lxp7cvu,2024-11-17 22:12:53,Needs a ton of development didn’t stand out at all today.Only Ice Hog that showed something was Guttman.
hawks,lxp80un,2024-11-17 22:17:11,He’s played like 5 games lmao
hawks,lxttgbt,2024-11-18 17:04:59,*Back in my day* on SBNation we used to argue about Kave vs JVR and some thought Kane was too small for the NHL and wanted JVR.  Only time will tell but yea I do see a lot of Demidov highlights on the French hocky sub and wonder what that could of been here.  Maybe we are trying to be more panthers with strong D then Very top heavy Oil?
hawks,lxpc872,2024-11-17 22:45:14,They feed up to the Canes this year.Highly recommend going to a game at all state though. They do an awesome job with the production and glass seats were $65 today 
hawks,lxpg1ni,2024-11-17 23:11:58,I think they have been around for 30+ years and at one point were a bigger draw than the hawks during the “worst franchise in all professional sports” era
hawks,lxpoi4a,2024-11-18 00:14:48,Just watched one random play in the 3rd and he looked pretty rough. Needs a lot of time (in the AHL) to develop.
hawks,lxpa2ls,2024-11-17 22:30:40,Most of us were. It’s also going to sting if Gabe Perreault becomes a big scorer on the Rangers and Oliver Moore is a 3rd liner on a less than average team.
hawks,lxpc033,2024-11-17 22:43:41,I mean wolves just dominated possession from the jump. The game wasn’t on the goalie at all. 
hawks,lxpc2p5,2024-11-17 22:44:11,AA was fine I thought tonight 
hawks,lxpuwld,2024-11-18 01:11:04,would yakemchuk have been a better defenseman pick in the draft?
hawks,lxq43fh,2024-11-18 02:43:22,He's played 8 and hasn't looked very good in any of them. That's according to the guys that watch the development leagues and report on prospects not me because I can't be assed to watch it.No one is saying looking meh in your first 8 games means he's not going to turn into a good NHL player. But it does likely mean he's not going to be getting a call up any time soon and there was some thought he'd have a shot at the roster year 1.Pair that with Korch also looking meh down there and our D prospects aren't all that exciting yet.
hawks,lxp85jz,2024-11-17 22:18:02,And hasn’t dominated at all… he’s a second overall pick
hawks,lxq2wuy,2024-11-18 02:30:42,There are actually Blackhawks alum playing against the cast of Shorsey the Letterkenny spinoff Tuesday. I've heard from other it's interesting and may be worth going
hawks,lxq4aie,2024-11-18 02:45:30,"After the first couple picks you can't play the ""this or that"" guy game anymore. The success rate on hitting stars late even halfway through the first round is minimal. And no GM does it regularly throughout their career. Much better to just think of each one as a lottery ticket."
hawks,lxpzsol,2024-11-18 01:58:20,I understand.   My comment was more of a dig at the B'Hawks need for improvement at  goalie and everywhere.   More youthful help from Rockford is always the goal towards the next Stanley Cup.  Go Blackhawks!!
hawks,lxpfylc,2024-11-17 23:11:19,This game was not on Weekes (sp?) but some of this seasons past games were. He doesn't move side to side well.
hawks,lxpzqbl,2024-11-18 01:57:40,I think Zeev Buium would've been a better pick.  Best we can do is give Arty time to develop.  The magic 200 pro games played mark for a D man.
hawks,lxp9hfn,2024-11-17 22:26:47,I mean thats a small sample. He has 5 points in 8 games. He’s coming off a foot injury. I’m sure you’re a Demidov truther but let the kid breathe a little. He was playing in Belarus a few years ago. He’s moved up in competition every year and has pretty much improved over the course of every season.
hawks,lxq47kw,2024-11-18 02:44:35,Idk why this is getting down voted. You’re 2OA on a 13m contract in a draft in which we passed on a world class winger the same age as bedard in Demidov … lev looks like a worse Seth jones on the eye test.
hawks,lxr7g5x,2024-11-18 08:52:51,The game being tomorrow and not a single hawks alumni announced yet makes me thing the best player is gonna be like Bollig or someone
hawks,lxr7jwc,2024-11-18 08:53:31,Ah I gotcha - Totally right then! I was also at that game so I wasn't sure with the commenting how many people had actually watched it or not and was just trying to add some more color
hawks,lxplqnf,2024-11-17 23:53:11,Ah fair enough. I only saw this game and thought the other hogs goalie is the hawks hope for the future 
hawks,lxt7rnt,2024-11-18 15:15:17,I meant that as in—that's funny and apt. Not that I am (still) bitter myself about Demidov etc.
hawks,lxpgvdi,2024-11-17 23:17:51,"""Demidov truther"" lol. Good one"
hawks,lxs5zvt,2024-11-18 12:05:20,What 13m contract lol
hawks,lxr91im,2024-11-18 09:03:05,Saw somewhere Crawford was spotted at the game on the 10th. He could be there but I wouldn’t have guessed that he’d be playing without knowing that. Problem is a lot of the guys we’d really want to see are either freshly out of hockey still in the league or guys like Hossa who have medical shit making it tough. Other events didn’t announce it until the day before and I think those fans were pretty happy with who they got.
hawks,lxptwwe,2024-11-18 01:01:47,We'll see about Commesso. He seems like a Kevin Lankinen tier goalie to me this far—career backup/spot starter. Goalies take a long time to develop though so I hope I'm wrong about him.
hawks,lxqnqs3,2024-11-18 06:18:38,Commesso is not the answer
hawks,lxlj423,2024-11-17 09:42:51,Over the next few years? They've drafted 16 other forwards in the first 3 rounds over the past 3 years. Of those guys only Nazar has played an NHL game and even that was just to give him a taste. A lot of them are going to start to get real shots to make the roster over the next couple years along with a ton of extra future picks. We'll need to hope that a handful of those guys are hits and at least one is a star.Immediately? The existing roster needs to figure out a way to make something click. They've got a lot of picks and I'm sure they'll pull the trigger if they see a good long term value but I don't see anything moving solely to make us more competitive this year. Maybe guys like Nazar or Dach get a call up. They probably fire Richardson and try to find a spark in a coaching change if it doesn't get better soon.In retrospect? I don't really know how much more they could have done in the offseason. This UFA class is turning out to be a disaster. Stamkos and Marchessault were the big ticket guys and they've played like absolute shit. Tuevo and Bertuzzi were supposed to be nice additions that aren't working. If we're bitching about not giving 8 years to Elias Lindholm or something we've lost the plot.
hawks,lxlc1j6,2024-11-17 08:54:42,I don’t think there is an answer at the moment but this is part of the process unfortunately. Everyone wanted/expected this team to be much better than they are. Defense still has some holes until guys like EDM Korchinski arty Rinzel are ready which for Arty and Rinzel are another year or two optimistically. Personally believe are biggest problem is Center. Our faceoff win % is terrible and we don’t really have a ton of center depth in our system. Once we’ve lost the faceoff we’re always on our heels and it’s gassing our guys to be able to do anything on offense. I still have faith in KFC and Richardson it’s all apart of the process.
hawks,lxlfwvu,2024-11-17 09:21:43,First of all the line combinations are absolutely atrocious right now.Second I do think the Blackhawks have a decent core of guys coming. Nazar gets a lot of attention since people have seen him in uniform and see what he’s doing in Rockford. Oliver Moore also looks phenomenally good at Minnesota right now and there are a handful of guys that the Blackhawks took finishing up in juniors that will be helpful with different types of roles needed.One thing the Hawks don’t have is a guy that can skate with Bedard  but also toughness. The Hawks have a couple of guys who have toughness. The issue is is that none of them can skate with Bedard for more than a period at a time. The type of player I’m alluding to is an Andrew Shaw type. I think they have a couple of guys who can fit that role coming (Ludwinski in RCK) plus one more which they just took in the draft (Boivert). For some reason Sam Savoie didn’t get a chance to stick with the team this year.
hawks,lxlm05o,2024-11-17 10:01:00,Marian Hossa isn’t walking through that door folks.
hawks,lxlh10l,2024-11-17 09:29:10,I am banking on nazar to atleast be a top 6. Probably 2C. Other then that we dont have any high end forward prospects. Boisvert looks to be a solid 2way Center but he'll be another year or 2 i think. This draft has a lot of high offensive prospects that we desperately need. Personally I want martone but he's looking to be 1st or 2nd. After that we should deffinently consider Misa he's pure offensive talent. Don't think they go defenseman I really wish they pulled off that trade with Columbus at draft to take demidov. We are 3 high end forwards away from where we will need to be.
hawks,lxm3nfx,2024-11-17 11:41:52,"I think all he needs is to play the way he plays and stop trying to ""fit"" himself into everyone's expectations.  He's got the talent but if he's trying to force it it's going to continue eluding him.  Don't try to be the Hawks Savior just be Connor and he'll be fine."
hawks,lxm87tb,2024-11-17 12:07:03,I have a lot of thoughts about this team’s identity and I’m fairly positive they won’t be liked on this sub.First: I’ve seen enough to say that I do not think Bedard is an NHL center. The size the puck possession but most importantly the face offs. Sure he’s only 19 and has room to progress so things can change but for the time being give the kid a fucking break. Let him have some fun again with less responsibilities play him as the top RW and let him coast around at the top of the point waiting for his generational shot. Solution: Pair him with Dickinson at center then plan for the future and hope we get Martone or Misa in the next draft.Second: Luke Richardson is not fit to be a Head Coach. He would make an outstanding Defense coach Vlasic Allen and Kaiser all look great and I do think Luke gets some of the credit. At the same time that same defensive system is absolutely ABYSMAL for offense. Our puck possession is ass water we are outshot the constant line shuffling leads to zero chemistry the players won’t listen to him and overall I feel like he’s lost the room. I’d love to see Bruce Boudreau get a call as he’s still looking for a HC spot. Third: Normally I’d agree with everyone in saying “leave the younger players down in Rockford for development” sake but this team has no identity. Into the season it was Kyle signing over 40 million in cap space for a bunch of bottom 6 hard working veterans to multi year deals. Well those same veterans are coasting. Hall Bertuzzi Teuvo even do not seem bought in to what the Hawks are doing. So with that said bring up Nazar Dach and Slaggart. Play Bedard with Nazar and Dickinson. Inject some energy into the lineup spread it out onto each line.Next games lineup should beNazar - Dickinson - Bedard Teuvo - Dach - Donato  Bertuzzi - Foligno - SlaggartHall - Reichel - Smith A mix of veterans with young players on each line AND FOR FUCK SAKE LEAVE IT FOR A COUPLE GAMES TO BUILD CHEMISTRY.
hawks,lxlc5rw,2024-11-17 08:55:32,To be honest I think he’s pushing too hard and it’s affecting his game. It may even hurt him in the long run. I would rather see him in Rockford building connections with the up and coming O players. The D players like Vlasic should be with the big club because D is much harder to learn. I think several of the vets we have are past due - Martinez and Brodie come to mind first slow and bad with the puck. Reichel is playing much better but I don’t think he’s a finisher and the same may hold true for Kurachev but Defensive O players are needed also. Goaltending is way better than I thought it would be. The power play as well as the entire offense is too focused on just Bedard. It should be spread out to prevent opp. teams from focusing just on Bedard; which is what’s happening and why the team is a 2 goal a game team.In the end my opinion is Richards should be dumped at years end. He’s not HC material. The number of times this team wasn’t ready to play at the start of the game is glaringly obvious to me at least.
hawks,lxlxjfq,2024-11-17 11:08:14,Part of the issue (for those that got to see the cup run teams) is that Kane and Toews came into the mix drafted as later picks. We had built up a pretty good core prior and then added those few pieces. With doing this tear down our top end pick off the top is Bedard (Vlasic is playing great so love to see that). So now the first years of Bedard are going to look much worse as we wait for picks and continue to draft. Turbo and Bertuzzi were oh crap we need to add something now to help. If we didn’t get Bedard the hawks would still be playing the slow build and adding 1-2 year veterans to fill spots. We will see Nazar Moore and others turn into pros. This will open up more space for Bedard in the future to do his thing. Reichel has been flying all over and playing great. Just need to find a few fast pace aggressive forechecking players that can go into the corners. Yes I know a lot of people did or didn’t want Kane back but getting Bedard to feel more comfortable on the powerplay that is your guy. His ability to not panic with the puck see the open player and if left alone he drives in and shoots. That would give Bedard the ability to become dangerous. You can pick apart the coach now for line combos(which I have in my own world) but overall next year is more a true test to me. Get a few more players coming in and shifting lines around.  Management for now is fine. If you were given this team coming in couldn’t really do much more. Want to bring up demidov either way not on this team right now. The guys we signed are because that’s all that’s out there.
hawks,lxmrk4a,2024-11-17 13:51:47,It always seems like the teams that make big changes take a long time to get it together the next season. Chemistry isnt always immediate or guaranteed. That said this team went from being a bad AHL roster last year to a bad NHL roster this year. I wasnt expecting much different than what we have seen so far.
hawks,lxm0luz,2024-11-17 11:25:11,Should have been Demidov if Davidson had a brain
hawks,lxlj2z7,2024-11-17 09:42:39,I don’t think the Kaprizov rumors are BS. If you can pair Kaprizov with Bedard with a gritty LW/C (Think Foligno but more skilled) then thats a great start. Teravainen Moore and Nazar headline the 2nd line and that’s a formidable top-6 for 2025. Just sayin.
hawks,lxlfwi0,2024-11-17 09:21:38,I would like to see Richardson mix up the lines so that we don't have 3 guys with the same skill set on one line. Specifically I'd put Bertuzzi with Bedard for a bit. I think Bedard when he's playing with other skill guys like Kurashev and Teravainen gets a little too unselfish and stays to the outside. He needs to play with someone who will drive the net win board battles and open up space for him.
hawks,lxm7m41,2024-11-17 12:03:42,Nazar - Bedard - Martone        Vlašić - Levshunov
hawks,lxlea6w,2024-11-17 09:10:30,I think Davidson made these moves as a cheap help for this year bc next years Free agency is loses Rantanen Boeser etc lots of good options that Davidson can’t afford to miss out on
hawks,lxltc7l,2024-11-17 10:44:17,Nazar when they decide to bring him up.But I don’t like the fact that in many of these games he’s flat out invisible.Overrated?
hawks,lxo2q3b,2024-11-17 18:07:57,Be prepared for 2-3 more years of this nonsense. Upside is right now no body can watch the games unless they pay an ungodly amount to download an app that should be free.
hawks,lxody6r,2024-11-17 19:13:38,I haven’t gotten to watch a single game this season because of the stupid network deal but the stats for donato have been looking real solid haven’t they?
hawks,lxrneoi,2024-11-18 10:28:11,We need better goaltending and a bit more size with speed on the first two lines. If we ever made it to a playoff we would get absolutely worked rn with the size we have. Bedard needs to be the playmaker not the puck retriever and the playmaker. Right now he has a good linemate for front of net presence but there isn’t a big body puck getter or pressure guy. Bertuzzi isn’t fast enough to put guys on their toes and create chaos.
hawks,lxlb0k5,2024-11-17 08:47:19,D pipeline is full at the moment with EDM Arty Rinzel and others. Kurashev is a bottom 6 player it seems. Draft trade or FA only option but not confident KFC will make right moves at this point.
hawks,lxmw64q,2024-11-17 14:15:42,Honestly until the scheme is changed no amount of help will matter.
hawks,lxlzn0r,2024-11-17 11:19:53,let’s all thank those three wins vs Sharks last year.  lmaooooo
hawks,lxm5x95,2024-11-17 11:54:23,Draft and a big free agency signing
hawks,lxmys72,2024-11-17 14:29:35,Bedsy's future elite line-mates have not been drafted yet.
hawks,lxnzorx,2024-11-17 17:50:30,Progress isn't linear. Especially when you're young. There are starts stops peaks valleys plateaus and regression even. Y'all need to chill. The only real question is: is our coach the right guy to lead these players through that development.
hawks,lxliws7,2024-11-17 09:41:33,Step 1 - Get rid of the coach. Step 2 - Get rid of the gm…………………..
hawks,lxrki5c,2024-11-18 10:12:03,A big help would have included bringing back Patrick Kane but our General Manager appears to be the smartest guy in the room. The kid trying to do what Kane already did for the franchise wouldn’t benefit from having that caliber of player on the ice with him or in the locker room with him.
hawks,lxmn1lr,2024-11-17 13:28:23,Well said!
hawks,lxlrdkw,2024-11-17 10:33:00,No the problem is for all of the 8 first round picks in the past three years there still isn't much in the system for top line talent.  Sure Nazar SHOULD be either a top line wing or 2C but why is he not playing more center than wing in Rockford?  Anyone looking to Rockford for improvement--that team looks the same as the Blackhawks low energy tons of turnovers bad goaltending.  Maybe they improve over the next few years but there aren't any needle-movers there.
hawks,lxmdckg,2024-11-17 12:35:37,Bedard is a big part of the awful face off numbers. If this were a competitive season he would only see the dot from about 15’ away. But it’s worth the fa off losses right now to get him the reps. Agree with everything you said about this being another year to be patient. So much young talent on the way. How they’re developed and how they perform is the key to a successful rebuild. 2 of the other exciting picks from last years draft haven’t even hit the A yet: Moore and Gajan. Gajan is a long ways away because goalies take time to bake but isn’t Moore supposed to be signing next year? That would mean 1/2-1 year in Rockford up in 26-27. By that time a bunch of other prospects should be fully baked and ready to go. 
hawks,lxnd90x,2024-11-17 15:47:50,This is such a great reminder of just how great and unusual Toews and his near 60% career faceoff win percentage was.  Those guys are hard to find.  Bedard I think will eventually grow into a face-off stud once he gets his man strength.  Youth can be frustrating.  Bedard really does spend a lot of time on his shifts trying to get the puck back.
hawks,lxn88st,2024-11-17 15:21:04,Agreed. Defense has holes. Personally while Murphy and Jones have eaten up minutes the gaps are there until some of the guys in Rockford are ready.Was also said on the ESPN+ broadcast (I watch out of state) that Bedard is pressing trying to I’m paraphrasing make magic every shift when all we need are one or two shifts where he’s a playmaker. My hope is maybe after the start of the new year some of those Rockford guys see time in Chicago.
hawks,lxmlo9i,2024-11-17 13:21:04,Don’t count out Dach either. I think him with Bedard right now could be an interesting combo. Dach I think has more skill than Shaw did but he has the grit that could help the top 6.
hawks,lxn2i8w,2024-11-17 14:49:52,No. And with current cap increases it will indefinitely make landing big free agents less common. Market has become bare bones last cpl years. There is a cpl upcoming. Rantanen Boeser and Marner should absolutely be targets for the hawks even if they have to overpay a bit. That's if they don't get resigned also. At some point of we can't land a free agent we need to trade for one. Plenty of draft capital and prospects to make it happen if needed.
hawks,lxmf7d3,2024-11-17 12:45:55,Moore should be coming up to the A next year. He should be a good add. Not a small dude either. Doesn’t break 6’ but is almost 200. Demidov hasn’t yet played any NA hockey. He ripped up the MHL but so far has about 1/3rd of the points in the K as he did last year 28 games in. MHL he played 30. He might be a case of beautiful game against plugs can’t hang with men. Time will tell but I’d rather have the young D talent if for no other reason than trade value. Everyone needs a solid D for cheap salary. Can’t say the same for small dangly forwards unless he does turn into Demigod. 
hawks,lxljj9g,2024-11-17 09:45:33,I’m no scout but unless they saw Levshunov as that much better I can’t believe they passed on Demidov considering he would be great for Bedard’s wing. I feel Dmen are a little easier to find than elite forwards. Maybe not elite dman (which they probably hope lev is).
hawks,lxmu1hk,2024-11-17 14:04:38,I don't know why they don't at least pair Bedard with Dickinson on the road. I get not doing it at home considering you can just put Dickinson out against the opposition's best and free up Bedard but might as well do it on the road at least sparingly.
hawks,lxmh7cg,2024-11-17 12:56:55,I actually agree with most of what you say. Except for the bit about coaching. I think Richardson is playing it safe so to speak. I think he’s teaching the team defensive hockey especially with limited offensive skill…I think that’ll come down the road. I’m not as worried about the offensive right now except for a high impact 1C…not sure Bedard is it. I think you’re spot on about the talent piece but I think that’s the second half plan. I think you’ll see guys like AA Hall Smith Maroon moved at the deadline to make room for Dach Slaggert Nazar.
hawks,lxlgdyn,2024-11-17 09:24:53,I don’t think you’re wrong here.If the old phrase people who play hockey use saying gripping the stick too tight. Not necessarily physically but mentally.
hawks,lxmu5cu,2024-11-17 14:05:11,This is why I hate always comparing this rebuild to the early 2000s . . . too much hindsight. When they drafted Toews and Kane no one thought Keith was going to be a HOF D Crawford was in the system but hadn’t played a game. Sharp had a whopping 9 goals. We don’t know how the current crop of prospects will turn out but 10 years from now we may look back and say that they had a bunch of their team in the system ahead of drafting Bedard:  Commesso and Soderblom?  Vlasic Kaiser Korchinski Del Mastro Rinzel Allan?  Reichel Dach Nazar Slaggert and guys like Green Hayes and Thompson are having varying degrees of success.
hawks,lxluth4,2024-11-17 10:52:47,Didn’t hear anything about Kaprizov. What is the rumour?
hawks,lxll30i,2024-11-17 09:55:19,He's been mixing the lines every game. Bedard has played with just about every forward combo the past 6 games and whatever that combo has been they have been getting pounded possession wise.Maybe time for Bedard to watch a game from the press box.
hawks,lxmfnwv,2024-11-17 12:48:28,The thing is the good players never even make it to free agency. The last big ticket player to sign as a ufa was probably John Tavares
hawks,lxlrxb2,2024-11-17 10:36:11,step 3 — draft an elite forward like Ivan Demidov…. oh wait
hawks,lxr9p62,2024-11-18 09:07:16,I think you're missing the point of Rockford. It's for developing not necessarily winning. Sure you have a number of AHL vet spots on that team but it's mostly guys learning the pro game and NHL system. Of course you'd prefer to see success. Rockford wins/losses is not a barometer for the NHL team trajectory. The guys that matter are doing well. Bedard has had some difficulty in the last couple of games. Other than that everyone is progressing.
hawks,lxmnqhr,2024-11-17 13:31:58,It’s hard for any center at that age and size to win face offs against most 1st line centers in this league
hawks,lxmr2gq,2024-11-17 13:49:10,I like Dach too. Well said by you.
hawks,lxranso,2024-11-18 09:13:26,Funny how much people forget how the D core was such a big reason we were a dynasty. People also forget why we went out for Seth Jones in the first place.
hawks,lxm7lry,2024-11-17 12:03:39,How many soft small forwards can you have tho. Playoffs reward gritty skilled players
hawks,lxmktwj,2024-11-17 13:16:36,AA already got moved to Rockford no? I don't see anyone taking his contract either and there's no sense in retaining on him to maybe get like a 7th round pick?
hawks,lxmyzcx,2024-11-17 14:30:41,"That's so true. Plus you have a lot of people try to compare a bunch of prospects to the player styles of the glory days like when people look for a ""Bolland"" or a ""Frolik"" which is a different era. And hindsight always plays a part like you stated because even the 2010s hawks didn't know what type of players they really needed to win until they did."
hawks,lxmzpt8,2024-11-17 14:34:35,I can agree with that for sure. Bedard is struggling now but he will be fine. He is a different player than McDavid (well who isn’t) Matthews and others. We have seen what he is capable of he will continue to grow. Just in his own head now and players go through that. The biggest difference he faces than a lot of other hawks we ever drafted is the expectations on his shoulders. Guys in the past were not expected to step in day one and just run the show.
hawks,lxreo64,2024-11-18 09:38:06,>Maybe time for Bedard to watch a game from the press box.Honestly I am surprised I haven't seen this take yet and was wondering if that is just a never option because he is kinda the golden goose..  Other players would of been benched for their def lapses that cause the team goals like he has and he has had some pretty bad Ovie style defense decisions and effort in this slump of his.  I am fine the team being bad if this makes Bedard develop some defense skills because we all know he could improve there a lot.
hawks,lxmu2fh,2024-11-17 14:04:46,Yep. Basically got to see bedards slump as a blessing in disguise. So hawks can draft hagens or martoneIf he had this slump last year hawks would have celebrini
hawks,lxrb4w6,2024-11-18 09:16:23,"Why is Nazar playing wing in Rockford yet everyone keeps acting like he's the 2C of the future?  He's on the wing for a powerplay with Guttman taking the draw.  What purpose does that serve?  My point is that in Rockford and Chicago it doesn't look like they there's even winning hockey at the most fundamental level.  They don't win faceoffs they don't maintain possession in the offensive zone they don't make the goalie work as much as other teams make the Hawks goalies work and they aren't hard to play against from a physicality standpoint.  I couldn't care less about wins or playoffs.  There should be some small areas where one can point to and say ""that's how they will win in the future"".  Their big plan was to have speed on top of speed do everything fast.  They just end up turning the puck over fast skating into the defense fast and looking like a bunch of fast guys chasing the puck around the ice."
hawks,lxmrjok,2024-11-17 13:51:43,Yup. And the only way he’s going to be decent or better at face offs is to keep getting the reps against as many different opponents as is practical. In a couple years when it’s time for making a playoff push he’ll hopefully be better or he’ll be on a wing. 
hawks,lxnghm5,2024-11-17 16:04:28,You might be able to take on 1/2 his contract for a 4th or 5th if he end up back and plays well? Could also couple with another player or to offset a contract…prolly right no one wants him but for a playoff team who knows.
hawks,lxltcnb,2024-11-17 10:44:21,Even after a bad game he is calm I like that. Great questions and fun answers. This year will be tough for everyone around the Hawks but he's going to break out and it'll be magnificent!
hawks,lxmy83f,2024-11-17 14:26:33,"Scott busting the ""never ate fast food"" myth was really funny it was like he'd never heard that rumor before. I bet Bedsy is so tired of answering what is basically the same questions worded differently every interview. Like bringing up that he has no hobbies and hockey is his life is just one example you could see him roll his eyes after Scott brought it up with the Foligno question. And yeah considering the lousy first ever game he'd just played in front of his home town crowd he's still cool as a cucumber."

hawks,lxl7546,2024-11-17 08:18:43,![gif](giphy|ukGm72ZLZvYfS)Holy shit!?!? I mean no we're not doing great but this is drastic... Bedard may be underperforming but that says more about the team/coaching than he and his contract. One fresh face can't save a franchise. Plucking 5 others from the league could be a boon but I think we probably have steps before offing 5 current hawks...Sorry bro I couldn't firing squad any names for you. This is fascinating and dark at the same time.

hawks,lxnvi56,2024-11-17 17:26:47,Lmfao also add in the fact every other team in Chicago are attempting to suck golf balls through a garden hose so there’s no hopping over to another team for a bit to ride this trash out. Cubs are by far the best team in Chicago right now and they’re seemingly super content with being mediocre as fuck.
hawks,lxs58x1,2024-11-18 12:01:29,Not quite. They added semi-pricey guys to improve the team. They are bottom of the league. Also the TV point has nothing to do with a rebuild. Also a key point of a rebuild is to see your best players get better. Bedard is regressing.

hawks,lxjy3tu,2024-11-17 00:45:51,I don’t care about that. Hawks are the 2nd worst team in the entire league and an abysmal offense. Another team being shitty doesn’t make things better. Hawks might have been a bottom 6 or so team at best but there was at least supposed to be improvement and progress.

All I’ve got is Soderblom and the success of the defense which are both arguably product of playing the most painfully boring style of hockey imaginable. The team needed to take a step and a month into the season everything has gone to shit. How could you not be disappointed with this?

You can't compete for worst in the league 3 year's in a row and expect fans to just lap it up and trust the process.

hawks,lxjx72d,2024-11-17 00:38:41,Soderblom had another great game.  Neither of those goals were his fault.  Dickinson was around the puck all night too and I'd like to see Reichel get more minutes.  Bedard really struggled.  He was invisible and when he wasn't it was one of his passes getting picked off.  I don't think I saw him complete a pass in the 3rd.Overall another very winnable game we can't score in.  It's getting old.  The entire city's sports teams are getting old.
hawks,lxjzt0t,2024-11-17 00:59:55,Luke was just asked about any possible system adjustments. “There’s not really much we can do” he said.
hawks,lxk8coa,2024-11-17 02:20:06,I'd call out Bedard's cold streak if literally anyone else on this team could score reliably. But the problem is that nobody is doing it. The issue is systemic and while we are getting really good at looking like we're staying with the other team this is the ceiling to such a system: trailing by a goal and then conceding empty netters in the final minutes.I get that the dump and chase ultra-conservative scheme was put in place to help us look at least kind of competitive while fielding a borderline AHL roster last year but we've actually got skill guys this year with more on the way next year. Bedard Teuvo Hall Vlasic and Reichel building confidence...these kinds of players are being fucking wasted on such boring hockey.
hawks,lxjzfwq,2024-11-17 00:56:50,If we’re gonna be the worst team 3 years in a row can we at least not be so fucking boring 
hawks,lxk99xn,2024-11-17 02:29:42,There are a couple guys playing well under Richardson. Donato this year Dickenson last year. These are physical dump and chase type of players. Which is the very type of guy that would excel in Richardson's dump and chase system. But guys like Turbo Bedard Reichel Hall and everyone we want to bring up shouldn't be playing that way.There's talk of benching bedard for a game. Maybe? But when the whole team can't do a single thing offensively I think I'd just replace the coach at this point and have that be the shakeup. I can't pretend I know enough about who's available or if it would have to be an interim (which it feels too early to just give an interim keys for a full season).This just feels like were going to lose a full season of development. And it feels increasingly clear Bedard may not be a center. Which again I think is okay. But it does exacerbate our problem of having no fucking to line centers. But I won't really be convinced of Bedard not being a center until we see him in a real system with a better coach.

hawks,lxjzdom,2024-11-17 00:56:18,Pro-tip to win hockey games: score some damn goals. Average goals per game in November (excluding shootout)? 1.85 from 13 in 7 games. Goal totals in the last 5 games? 1 1 2 1 1. Call it bad puck luck or good opposing goaltending or whatever excuse but something is clearly fundamentally broken with this offense. It’s gonna take either some change in overall strategy or (hopefully) Bedard to get going for things to be watchable when the puck occasionally approaches the opposing blue line.Tonight wasn’t as hard a watch as the game Thursday night. But it’s just exhausting watching inaccurate passes dump-ins that clearly won’t reach anyone and nights where the shot counter fails to cross double digits before the 3rd period man.

You got guys like Rantanen Boeser Rossi Shesterkin and many others that could really help this team in the long-term.
hawks,lxk10o4,2024-11-17 01:10:48,Thank God that unprotected 1st round pick trade didn't go through with the way things are going so far lol.
hawks,lxjzztm,2024-11-17 01:01:32,He’s tried nothing and he’s out of ideas
hawks,lxk2mkc,2024-11-17 01:25:17,I’m starting to think he’s a dumbass lol
hawks,lxk1ko9,2024-11-17 01:15:52,I refuse to believe that there’s “not much”…that is some lunacy of a statement. Unless he’s talking lineup changes for the nth time I don’t understand that statement at all.
hawks,lxk0vqu,2024-11-17 01:09:32,It's no surprise that when the Hawks brought in Quennville a guy that had a ton of experience coaching in the league things immediately started getting tightened up and improved. Meanwhile they've hired two guys with very little head coaching experience since and both have looked lost. It's the same shit with the Bears. Just hire someone with actual experience that has a track record of winning even if it's not a championship.
hawks,lxk8ra3,2024-11-17 02:24:18,This is why I hope Nazar doesn't get called up anytime soon. He's lighting it up in the AHL and gaining confidence but he'd no doubt get stifled and frustrated playing on this team as it stands right now.
hawks,lxjzgtz,2024-11-17 00:57:02,Yes. We can’t JUST rely on an opponent’s mistakes we need to actually generate offense. Easier said than done but playing more aggressive would be playing to more of the roster’s strengths like we saw in the first few games where it was fun and competitive. 
hawks,lxjytvw,2024-11-17 00:51:41,Agreed. Obviously Bedard has been damn rough in hardcore sophomore slump or whatever the phrase is but compounding with that 6 goals in the past 5 games is not going to win it either except in select cases such as Minnesota. It’s not a sustainable way to run offense. They told us the offense changed when they added this talent in free agency but how much of it is on that talent and how much is on coaching? Everyone’s throwing out ideas such as scratching Bedard for a game of something like firing Richardson…but all I want to see is SOME sort of change or SOME sort of action instead of the 500th lineup edit that doesn’t do anything.
hawks,lxjwz6b,2024-11-17 00:36:52,Been this way for 3 years
hawks,lxjzby5,2024-11-17 00:55:53,Team is building that losing culture that has sunk Buffalo's decade long rebuild.
hawks,lxk35rn,2024-11-17 01:29:54,Was at the game tonight. He seemed pretty invisible except for the boner that led to EN goal #1.
hawks,lxk2sgd,2024-11-17 01:26:41,He’s 19 won’t see full potential till he’s like 25
hawks,lxk3b9a,2024-11-17 01:31:12,Difference is the Hawks haven’t made me lose my soul like the Bears have. That is a small moral victory for Richardson 
hawks,lxjy0eh,2024-11-17 00:45:07,Dump and chase often works they just don’t chase this is dump and turnover lol
hawks,lxk4q2b,2024-11-17 01:43:59,I get what you're saying but none of those guys played on the same line together that often. Bedard needs to play better no excuses. Way too many turnovers and bad decisions. He's only 19 I'm not worried about the long term but right now he is playing awful regardless of linemates.
hawks,lxk4k3g,2024-11-17 01:42:27,how else can this team get an elite forward? Top 3 pick!
hawks,lxjyia2,2024-11-17 00:49:03,Blip.  He's 19 and it's not like he has the 2009 Hawks talent around him like Kane did.  He's going to struggle and it's probably going to be the first time in his life that he has hockey wise at least.  Let's give him some room to grow up and for the team to get better.
hawks,lxjye89,2024-11-17 00:48:08,He’s playing like garbage but you’d be hard pressed to find a single player who’s playing above replacement level right now except MAYBE Donato. In my opinion this is far more reflective of how bad the coaching is than any individual player.
hawks,lxjxtv9,2024-11-17 00:43:40,Concerned he's on pace for 14 goals this year. He was touted as a generational player like Crosby and McDavid both of whom put up 100 or more points in their second seasons.
hawks,lxk6ica,2024-11-17 02:01:24,Levshunov isn't ready for the NHL. I wish they'd have picked Demidov instead but even so he wouldn't be able to play in the NHL this year due to the KHL thing. Regardless it's not a player issue it's a scheme/coaching issue
hawks,lxkaskc,2024-11-17 02:45:55,Arty is no where near ready to make his debut.
hawks,lxjy0e5,2024-11-17 00:45:07,It worked for Michkov in Philly but then again he has Torts as a coach and not a bum like Richardson.
hawks,lxjxv4c,2024-11-17 00:43:57,2 games in a row that we are looking for a late goal to tie the game and he gave away the puck. Might do him some good to watch a game from the rafters
hawks,lxk36aa,2024-11-17 01:30:01,Melt for Misa
hawks,lxjxp5x,2024-11-17 00:42:36,Worse
hawks,lxjwq9j,2024-11-17 00:34:48,When's the next time we play a bad team ?
hawks,lxjxuzt,2024-11-17 00:43:55,Easy there Tiguan
hawks,lxjyzsq,2024-11-17 00:53:02,Bedard's best linemates possible is guys with like max 60 points in the last few years in an era where points are upBedard is playing awful but he's so young and we have terrible offensive help
hawks,lxk2m1z,2024-11-17 01:25:10,I bet they would lol
hawks,lxk85xj,2024-11-17 02:18:10,Show us where we offered
hawks,lxk2rh1,2024-11-17 01:26:27,I mean Demidov would arguably be a top pick in this draft and you’d get him a year earlier. Wouldn’t have been that bad.
hawks,lxk2rln,2024-11-17 01:26:29,They'd have Demidov beside Bedard next season if that had happened. I'd take that. Unless I'm missing the /s
hawks,lxk0mix,2024-11-17 01:07:08,“We need to play more defensive”- Luke probably 
hawks,lxk7nma,2024-11-17 02:12:58,Dump and chase with the net empty? Say no more!
hawks,lxn2aez,2024-11-17 14:48:40,He’s tried changing the lines 591 times. Let’s do 592 and see if it works.
hawks,lxk2lup,2024-11-17 01:25:07,The regular blender is broke time for the industrial blender
hawks,lxk7cr7,2024-11-17 02:09:51,They already had all the key players that would win Cups except for Hossa. Stop comparing the two eras.
hawks,lxkd3c4,2024-11-17 03:10:39,Korch too. I'm glad he doesn't have to be up here for this shit show.
hawks,lxjzegi,2024-11-17 00:56:29,Bedard and Teravainen: *instant connection throughout the first few games of the season*Richardson: “Alright Bedsy you’re on your own; Teuvo hit the third line”
hawks,lxjzimq,2024-11-17 00:57:28,It can’t be a whole season like this. We have only played 18 games but they’re just a very frustrating team.I really don’t think they’d fire Richardson. At least not yet. Safe to assume he’s safe for the rest of the season.I don’t know what the solution is but something has to spark some energy into these players. Moving the puck up ice from their own zone establishing possession in their zone & getting shots on net is extremely difficult for this team. It’s 5 players on the ice nowhere near a cohesive unit.
hawks,lxjzt55,2024-11-17 00:59:57,Yeah Bedard is clearly frustrated and struggling. That said there has been very little 5-on-5 offense from the entire team. Ryan Donato has been a bright spot but that's about it. Personally I think this team is talented enough to be playing better than they are.
hawks,lxjxc4m,2024-11-17 00:39:46,Last year we were at least letting the kids play which led to some games where we got killed but also some games where we could put up some goals. Now we’re trying to get everyone to buy into this system that is against offense.
hawks,lxk0i54,2024-11-17 01:05:58,I don’t know how anyone could have expected a different outcome when you have a leadership group of Foligno Jones and Murphy.
hawks,lxs4mrz,2024-11-18 11:58:21,I think Bedards defensive choices and lack of high effort in that area are the issues and not the lack of scoring he is doing.  He is making key mistakes at costly times and anyone else would be benched for it.  This entire year is probably a 'learn defense' knowing we were not supposed to be anything > bottom 10 and it should be.
hawks,lxjzsvc,2024-11-17 00:59:53,He’s made a few garbage plays but the slump is the result of a spiral.  A few games ago he still looked like a stud that no one else on the team could feed off of.  He’s forced to adjust (which tbf isn’t a bad thing but) which is causing him to make unfamiliar often bad plays
hawks,lxjytdj,2024-11-17 00:51:34,They also had legit star talents with them on their team our team just isn't that rn
hawks,lxl2pgi,2024-11-17 07:43:14,That’s what’s so 50-50 about Richardson I know people say he should go but there have been some oments where he’s been decent let’s so I mean we weren’t gonna be a contender in the first place to begin with and we haven’t been getting blown out outside of the opening game vs Utah and The first meeting with Vancouver I heard that Richardson was extended till 27 but tbh I think that could change if by next year or the following when we have more talent on this team he could prob get fired
hawks,lxkaz4h,2024-11-17 02:47:52,Bend the knee for McQueen.
hawks,lxjy93e,2024-11-17 00:47:01,Tuesday against Anaheim
hawks,lxk84ap,2024-11-17 02:17:43,It's not about that. When Q joined he immediately started holding players responsible for their own effort. Let's not forget the Kane and Sharp benchings. If you wanted to play games under Q you had to put maximum effort in practice and be responsible in all areas of the ice during games.Again it's not about talent on the ice it's about fundamentals and effort. A bad team can still be competitive in most games if there's a coherent game plan and actual accountability and standards.
hawks,lxjzslw,2024-11-17 00:59:50,That’s still got me confused lol. He moved him after Teuvo made some mistakes in a few games right? Like they happen—they’re still happening in these games but they generated offense at the very least and could set up more than any of the lines can now. The only consistent factor right now are the goalies (knock on wood).
hawks,lxk0z93,2024-11-17 01:10:26,That is a good point on both Richardson and our system being difficult. I can imagine if it’s frustrating for us just watching it’s frustrating for them playing but at what rate will we see the spark and what does that spark need to be? I think that’s what they need to decide before concerning themselves with the “where are the goals coming from” that they showed us in the Every Shift video. We have talent not enough for playoffs but that talent has been invisible across the entire roster and placed us in the very spot we wanted to move up from standing wise. (BIG caveat that it’s only been 18 games) 
hawks,lxk0ph0,2024-11-17 01:07:53,I completely agree. Even if that doesn’t necessarily translate to many more wins it should be better to watch at the very least but it’s sliding into the same system it was last year (just not as many blowouts lol) which has me disappointed personally.
hawks,lxjzkzf,2024-11-17 00:58:01,They did but those two can drive their lines Bedard simply hasn't shown the ability to this year.  He barely ever has the puck in the the offensive zone.This isn't me saying Bedard sucks or is a bust but it's undeniable compared to expectations he is underperforming hard.
hawks,lxousvg,2024-11-17 20:54:22,That’s what I want from the coach of an Original Six team: decent at moments.
hawks,lxs5uzw,2024-11-18 12:04:39,I wonder if there are some issues with everyone besides Bedard having consequences for their bad decisions / errors.
hawks,lxk006i,2024-11-17 01:01:37,My point exactly bud.  Errors happen no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater
hawks,lxk4yke,2024-11-17 01:46:16,the problem here to me is that mcdavid and crosby both had much better players with them who were able to be elevated. there were a string of games this year where bedard really was creating opportunity that other guys weren’t finishing or cashing in on. throwing a young mcdavid/crosby on this roster could’ve honestly produced similar results mcdavid might’ve been different because of just how his speed would catch defenders off-guard. either way tho this team is struggling much more than those two teams were in their star’s sophomore seasons with worse guys on their team.it’s also worth noting that mcdavid’s expectations weren’t just met they were surpassed. outside of him and crosby there isn’t necessarily a player who’s surpassed their expectations as a first overall imo. hell mackinnon is an absolute animal of a player but he really didn’t start becoming a consistent top-end player until a little later into his career.i think bedard will find a pocket of games this year where he starts to look more like himself and he might have a similar breakout to mack once you get some genuine top-end talent around him.
hawks,lxjvwsk,2024-11-17 00:27:55,I think having him with maroon is paying off. He always seemed scared to get into the gritty areas before but ever since they’ve got him with maroon he’s got more tenacity
hawks,lxjxd26,2024-11-17 00:39:58,I loved seeing Reichel pop right back up after being knocked down. It really does feel like Maroon and Smith helped him btw the ears. It's time for him to have a solid look in the top-six.
hawks,lxm6sbu,2024-11-17 11:59:07,I'm all here for the Reichel Redemption Arc!
hawks,lxjsuvt,2024-11-17 00:02:38,I've been high on high on him since day one I'm really glad to see he's finally going off
hawks,lxjubgm,2024-11-17 00:14:37,He's starting to find his footing in the league. I'm very happy for him and hope he keeps developing well. I've been dying to see him flourish
hawks,lxjwlk0,2024-11-17 00:33:40,I've always liked him sets up plays simply on another team that's really good he'd be elite on 3rd line 
hawks,lxk72yk,2024-11-17 02:07:06,He has looked great and had great jump each night. Results haven't been there yet but he's been flying around and looks good
hawks,lxk2gvh,2024-11-17 01:23:58,Gosh wonder where all this support for him is coming from. Coulda used you all this past year
hawks,lxjw3mx,2024-11-17 00:29:31,I think so for sure. He seems to be going into more of the griddy areas and fighting for pucks which I like
hawks,lxjz067,2024-11-17 00:53:07,Yeah I liked that a lot. Tough game all around. I really don’t care about wins I just want to see some production out of our quality players
hawks,lxk8mna,2024-11-17 02:22:57,You and me both. I was terrified we were going to ruin him and then trade him away for peanuts after last year's failed Center experiment. So happy to see him thriving!
hawks,lxk977y,2024-11-17 02:28:55,He was playing like shit last season. Got sent down and deserved it. And it’s not like he has a history of being great and just struggling he had no history and kinda looked like a bust. Seemed like the AHL may have been the ceilingThis year totally different story. It wasn’t just that he wasn’t making plays last year but he wasn’t making up for it with grit and effort. He’s doing both right now so all the sweeter that he fought through and looks to be on a good path. 
hawks,lxl63as,2024-11-17 08:10:32,Agreed but it's *Gritty
hawks,lxkse2z,2024-11-17 06:00:35,Griddy areas?
hawks,lxkc7r4,2024-11-17 03:01:10,"Nah he only looked like a bust to the sort of fan that thinks his problem was ""effort"" or that ""effort"" is a valid critique in like over 90% of the instances where that word's thrown around. We've seen this exact Reichel before - yes at the NHL level. This is just what you get when he has confidence and chemistry i.e. isn't second-guessing all of his decisions and instincts i.e. it suddenly looks like he's giving more ""effort"" out there. The number of people in this fandom who genuinely were ready to give up on him a few weeks into his sophomore slump was pretty remarkable. The number of people who really believed he wouldn't even fetch a 4th-round pick over the summer was sad. And now they're all going to get to go right back to being his fan and soaking in the dopamine he'll bring them and will never have to own the vitriol thrown his way or admit they might not know prospects that well"
hawks,lxn0ikd,2024-11-17 14:38:56,Ahh haha

hawks,lxig5f3,2024-11-16 18:39:22,Accountability is happening. Hall has been hot garbage and needs to sit down.
hawks,lxinx2e,2024-11-16 19:27:13,Clip about Hall;>“Unfortunately the schedule hasn’t allowed a lot of practice time for him so that’s the plan” Richardson said. “I think just coming off eight nine months out to us we just want to get him a little bit more work and then it’s hard to do that in the games and not get too frustrated and chase it. So that’s our plan.”>Richardson hinted that Hall’s benching could last multiple games. He said Hall is “not happy sitting out” but said it’ll be a “good step for him.”>“Players want to play and I totally understand that” Richardson said. “But that’s just a decision that we feel (will) help the player. … So hopefully we can get a couple good (days) on the ice for him feeling good with the puck and playing like Taylor Hall plays — skating up and down the ice with the puck and recovering pucks in the O-zone and moving his feet and getting lots of opportunities. Our team didn’t do a great job getting through the neutral zone as a team last game so that takes away from a guy like him’s game. It’s me personally thinking that’s a good plan for the next week. I know the player disagrees but sometimes that happens.”
hawks,lxjapps,2024-11-16 21:52:51,Ugh this makes the $20/month to watch them an even tougher pill to swallow
hawks,lxijh05,2024-11-16 18:59:56,Hall hasn’t played well. The short sample we got last year he looked great.

hawks,lxjpexi,2024-11-16 23:36:03,This feels like trades might be incoming at least in Hall's case

hawks,lxixf9q,2024-11-16 20:26:35,Upvoted for bluesky!
hawks,lxj16yx,2024-11-16 20:50:11,Can we bench the coach too? Yeah hall hasn’t been the best but he’s not in his prime any more and is a 2nd /3rd line winger at best. The line up combinations tonight say enough that Richardson doesn’t have a clue what he is doing anymore.
hawks,lxjlbto,2024-11-16 23:05:08,Take it with a grain of salt as Lazarus hates the Hawks way more than any beat writer should hate their team.
hawks,lxm6gum,2024-11-17 11:57:22,Comment section shows that most hawks fans have 0 knowledge
hawks,lxjec4u,2024-11-16 22:17:03,Where’s the guy who said 33 year old journeyman bust Hall was “getting faster”?
hawks,lxioh01,2024-11-16 19:30:36,Hopefully seth jones makes a slow recovery
hawks,lxiu70q,2024-11-16 20:06:04,By no means am I a hockey guy but in the shitshow of a game between the Hawks and Seattle Seth Jones had the worst shift of the game sometime either early 2nd or late 1st. Rebounded the puck right outside the crease and had a defensive turnover in like 5 seconds. Clearly something’s wrong and we should be giving a younger hungry guy those shifts because even if he fucks up he’s hungry and will scramble to correct the mistakes.
hawks,lxjvxmd,2024-11-17 00:28:07,Jones has been a bust since day 1
hawks,lxjelof,2024-11-16 22:18:49,I was dumbstruck to see the post from a few days ago with many here calling for Hall to be extended (seemingly based on pedigree-only). He's been just a guy this year thus far.
hawks,lxm03pj,2024-11-17 11:22:26,bruh just visit the eastern stream
hawks,lxjljk9,2024-11-16 23:06:43,Donato Dickinson Anderson and Foligno would probably be the last 4 forwards I’d sit right now.
hawks,lxmtdh5,2024-11-17 14:01:11,Where can we check out these heatmaps? Thanks!
hawks,lxil5au,2024-11-16 19:10:12,Sports writers recently made a big move to Bluesky. Far more activity there now than previously.
hawks,lxin40g,2024-11-16 19:22:16,Yes. The fruits of this rebuild are a 1-3 years away except Bedard
hawks,lxjlo7c,2024-11-16 23:07:41,Take what with a grain of salt?Jones will never live up to his contract but he was still logging big minutes and was having a surprisingly strong offensive contribution. That’s a big loss. Hall was pencilled in as a top or second line player and key offensive weapon. Him struggling is a disaster for a thin team.
hawks,lxjgzxg,2024-11-16 22:35:10,Bust? Dude was MVP.
hawks,lxiokmw,2024-11-16 19:31:13,Jones logs a lot of minutes and has generated some offense support. He’s not entirely useless.
hawks,lxj698d,2024-11-16 21:23:13,Yeah you’re right a veteran who eats up 26 minutes a game has a bad shift and should probably be scratched. Do you even hear yourself?
hawks,lxjgaqh,2024-11-16 22:30:17,At least you were right about not being a hockey guy.
hawks,lxixrv0,2024-11-16 20:28:44,Hawks D pipeline is weak.  Levshunov is a bust
hawks,lxjiqcj,2024-11-16 22:46:52,He had a stretch of 2-3 games where he looked like he was at his prime. That fell off a cliff pretty quickly and THEN rumors of his extension started.
hawks,lxmux7r,2024-11-17 14:09:11,It’s on Natural Stat Trick great way to see where the chances are coming from in both zones.
hawks,lxipx32,2024-11-16 19:39:32,I hope they keep the momentum going. What I miss the most about Twitter was being able to follow journalists and people generally having fun in ways that didn’t advance fascism. It’s hard to enjoy a good BOFA prank and get on the ground reporting in a conflict zone when you’re bombarded with threats against Jewish people.
hawks,lxiowni,2024-11-16 19:33:17,That’s insane it’s gonna take 3 more years. I’m average Hawks fan. But is what 5-7 years normal for a rebuild
hawks,lxiyxf6,2024-11-16 20:35:57,>He’s not entirely useless.I get that he’s a little over paid but he’s still a damn good defenseman.He’s a #2 on a contender and a fringe #1 on any other team.Our fanbase has just dogpiled him.
hawks,lxisu32,2024-11-16 19:57:29,Just look at what happened last year when he was out. Yikes! Vlasic is contending for number 1 on this team now. Hopefully it's not a poop show tonight. Hopefully Martinez is a green light.
hawks,lxjdjui,2024-11-16 22:11:50,If it’s consistently happening where we’re losing games because our first line defender is playing like shit in winnable that’s a problem.
hawks,lxj4uju,2024-11-16 21:13:58,What a dumb thing to post.
hawks,lxiyvr8,2024-11-16 20:35:40,I’ll believe it when I see it.
hawks,lxpsrnb,2024-11-18 00:51:20,Thanks!
hawks,lxllslr,2024-11-17 09:59:43,Yeah but then I check out Blue Sky annd immediately see Bernstein preface something with “I understand I’m a straight white CIS male so I recognize my privilege” and just deleted that app.We’re in an interesting place as a society where someone even thinks they have to say something that crazy. I’m too old for social media unless it’s extremely curated like Reddit. 
hawks,lxiqnql,2024-11-16 19:44:06,It takes 5 years. 2005 was when they started to build up their prospects again. Traded for 23 year old Sharp. Seabrook Keith and byfuglien were all rookies. As was crawford who played a game that year. Shit takes time. 
hawks,lxk38br,2024-11-17 01:30:31,Do you think our rebuild started last year?
hawks,lxiqdmk,2024-11-16 19:42:24,I said the players are 1-3 years away not that the hawks will be good the second they hit the NHL. I don’t think it’s insane to say they could be a playoff team in 27 or 28.
hawks,lxivh0i,2024-11-16 20:14:10,Prob one more season after this one until you see most of these prime picks together. However plan to see them make a jump next year but not be a contender for another year after (as said)
hawks,lxshmk9,2024-11-18 13:03:38,Snowflake
hawks,lxloh20,2024-11-17 10:15:52,Seems like an easy problem to avoid. Personally I just don’t follow a lot of white people who talk about race or dudes who talk about gender unless they’re an expert in something and can write with some confidence. Then you won’t see people prefacing their own thoughts.
hawks,lxil80z,2024-11-16 19:10:39,I guess we will see for sure if he was really a part of the problem. Heal up Jonesy.
hawks,lxjbc77,2024-11-16 21:57:00,Anyone heard an ETA on a potential return yet?
hawks,lxig829,2024-11-16 18:39:49,Where did this come from
hawks,lxiw0ps,2024-11-16 20:17:39,Damn look I know he’s been playing bad but now you gotta feel bad oh well if he was apart of the problem which at times he was there could be a lot of changes
hawks,lxiwly8,2024-11-16 20:21:23,He’s not a problem. He’s just not a game breaker number 1 dman like those that are in his pay bracket. He’s not the reason we lose but also isn’t the reason we’re going to be a contender. Except for his contract…
hawks,lxih1g4,2024-11-16 18:44:54,Happened when he blocked a shot last game
hawks,lxjnrov,2024-11-16 23:23:21,I'd rather have 2 defenceman for the prize of his salary tbh
hawks,lxs1jw9,2024-11-18 11:42:48,I hate him mostly because he wears Hammers number and I would rather have a Hammer then him but I do think it will be interesting to see how things go without him and then with him back.  Vlasic is looking like the next hammer.I do worry that our D core / pipeline is getting kinda thick and I am hoping that Jones can be out before the young guns are able to be up and in their prime without having to have to send some away because we have his contract vs paying the young ones.
hawks,lxkacpx,2024-11-17 02:41:14,Same especially if it meant that Bedard could properly run the power play without having Seth looking him off constantly
hawks,lxsazhs,2024-11-18 12:30:30,We have Jones until like 2029 and with that cap hit. I wouldn’t hold my breath on him getting moved. Buy out is not an option either with that amount and term attached. The best bet would be salary retention for a trade or he becomes an absolute stud. Like I said above I wouldn’t hold my Breath on any alternatives to the reality.
hawks,lxhm2hr,2024-11-16 15:46:39,Not sure when it will be official but they[leaked awhile ago](https://www.secondcityhockey.com/chicago-blackhawks-st-louis-blues-winter-classic-jerseys-reports-updates/)
hawks,lxi7hw6,2024-11-16 17:45:45,Surprised they haven't released them yet or at least shown an official image with a release date. Iirc the last couple of winter classics they released an image in early November and had them on sale mid November
hawks,lxj7tuh,2024-11-16 21:33:39,Biggest surprise to me is that the Blackhawks jersey was leaked so early but not a word anywhere about the Blues jersey.  Not even in tight circles is there a whiff of what the design is.
hawks,lxhlrd2,2024-11-16 15:44:59,Should be announced by end of November I assume on sale first week or two of December
hawks,lxj42dz,2024-11-16 21:08:48,Hoping they release the jerseys soon. Also surprised we haven't seen any sneak peeks of the Blues winter classic jerseys.
hawks,lxia4ph,2024-11-16 18:01:36,This franchise is being run by some inept folks these days. Rocky took this team out of the literal and figurative basement. His son Danny and his incompetent operations leader Jamie Faulkner keep making decisions that border on idiotic.
hawks,lxiz8cb,2024-11-16 20:37:52,Hopefully soon.  I really liked the look of
hawks,lxt3cyp,2024-11-18 14:52:45,I was at the Hawks downtown store two days ago and asked this very question. The woman who seemed like the manager told me to expect an official announcement sometime next week but that’s all I got. She also confirmed that the leaked image was indeed the jersey.
hawks,lxjvpku,2024-11-17 00:26:14,Leak aside is there any chance Fanatics makes an Authentic Pros version of them?
hawks,lxqwtmd,2024-11-18 07:38:18,I think the CHGO guys mentioned that Vlasic is going to be on the show today. I wonder if he's going on because they will also be announcing the jersey today/this wee
hawks,lxp8gch,2024-11-17 22:19:59,Hopefully I have an image tomorrow.
hawks,lxhmjxw,2024-11-16 15:49:20,It would be a huge missed opportunity to not have them available for sale by black Friday
hawks,lxu5pbf,2024-11-18 18:11:43,Next week as in the week of Thanksgiving or next week as in this week? 
hawks,lxmkxww,2024-11-17 13:17:12,Are the Authentic Pros the ones that are made in Canada?
hawks,lxp8ebt,2024-11-17 22:19:37,Yes they will. I already have a Blues on the way but the vendor has no idea what the Blues ones look like. He says it should show up to him tomorrow.
hawks,lxhu79f,2024-11-16 16:30:59,Why
hawks,lxnfbmd,2024-11-17 15:58:40,Yeah those are the ones
hawks,lxhzoij,2024-11-16 17:01:11,Getting them out just in time for the holiday shopping rush.
hawks,lxjr19v,2024-11-16 23:48:39,Bedard needs to learn to keep moving his feet and use his stick to put pressure on the guy with the puck. He has a habit of just floating out there. This is partly why his line barely ever keeps possession and has so much trouble getting the puck back in the D zone. Reichel might not be putting up many points but the way he's been playing is how I want to see Bedard to start playing. Very active stick and is always skating at full speed. Bedard has good speed but he rarely skates at full speed.
hawks,lxh3md2,2024-11-16 14:06:35,I would like Connor Bedard and Lukas Reichel to do something exciting in this game.
hawks,lxjeula,2024-11-16 22:20:28,Crazy what happens when you go. To. The. Net.
hawks,lxjhrxx,2024-11-16 22:40:29,Vlasic is such a beaut that he makes a good play even when he fucks up.
hawks,lxjrwam,2024-11-16 23:55:07,I have alot of grievances to air with Richardson
hawks,lxjtezv,2024-11-17 00:07:06,I know this probably isn’t the case but this offense looks as bad if not worse than last year and I don’t know how that’s possible.
hawks,lxjvmxm,2024-11-17 00:25:37,Every hawks game is the same this year.
hawks,lxjvv0t,2024-11-17 00:27:30,This teams offense is as lifeless as Richardson is behind the bench 
hawks,lxjewmu,2024-11-16 22:20:51,Mikyev revenge game
hawks,lxjv2o2,2024-11-17 00:20:54,Bro wtf is that. Call the trip ffs
hawks,lxgme0x,2024-11-16 12:35:13,Bedard do something…
hawks,lxgk3jw,2024-11-16 12:23:02,Bedard is due for a breakout game
hawks,lxjey7v,2024-11-16 22:21:08,That ref has gotten in the way of the puck like 3 times.
hawks,lxjfztz,2024-11-16 22:28:11,Hawks playing 3rd period hockey in the 1st period!
hawks,lxjge4e,2024-11-16 22:30:55,Zebras are letting the Canucks get away with a decent amount of obvious penalties.  A few definite trips and sticks being held.
hawks,lxjgi05,2024-11-16 22:31:39,Love how fast we are playing just need  to play like this for 3 periods
hawks,lxjn5ge,2024-11-16 23:18:39,I’m very happy that Soda seems to be over his “He shoots Soderblom rebound they score” phase
hawks,lxjsrhk,2024-11-17 00:01:52,If you think about it a D pairing of Kaiser and Brodie is completely insane.
hawks,lxjt3vp,2024-11-17 00:04:38,That’s game. We’re not scoring again.
hawks,lxjv1hi,2024-11-17 00:20:37,Clearly a fucking trip
hawks,lxjvgt6,2024-11-17 00:24:12,Enough is enough when will the coaching staff be held accountable. We get it it’s a rebuild but 1 goal a game with minimal effort isn’t gonna cut it
hawks,lxjvudg,2024-11-17 00:27:21,Life right now hawks are hot shit. Gotta see the bears lose to the packers tommorow.Cubs did nothing this season and so far nothing this free agency.Bulls are trying to trade zach lavine and are STILL rebuilding.Soccer team so ass I almost forgot about them.
hawks,lxjwkl2,2024-11-17 00:33:26,This defensive mindset is brutal and boring as fuck
hawks,lxjvlhp,2024-11-17 00:25:16,Bedard getting that sophomore slump sucks
hawks,lxjetdm,2024-11-16 22:20:15,If I was a betting man I’d would have bet on mikheyev to score. Something about playing your old team. They always find a way
hawks,lxjewz8,2024-11-16 22:20:55,LFG!!! Nice start. Bedsy at home.
hawks,lxjm5ih,2024-11-16 23:11:16,Honestly fine with that penalty by Kaiser. You’re supposed to make the other team uncomfortable being in the crease
hawks,lxjmxk4,2024-11-16 23:17:01,Wonder if Bertuzzi just plays every game hammered
hawks,lxjojds,2024-11-16 23:29:14,it gets exhausting watching this team chase the puck around for large stretches of games.
hawks,lxjq4zr,2024-11-16 23:41:45,Gotta move on from the bedard/kurashev duo they’ve shown no chemistry this year
hawks,lxjt4n9,2024-11-17 00:04:48,1 goal every game isn't gonna get it done
hawks,lxjt7vk,2024-11-17 00:05:30,There goal song is so lame crowd is mild asf
hawks,lxjty24,2024-11-17 00:11:33,How does this hawks team score less goals than the ducks and sharks 
hawks,lxju5dc,2024-11-17 00:13:15,Hawks never fail to make mid goalies look elite
hawks,lxjuvr5,2024-11-17 00:19:18,K call a goalie interference at least sheesh
hawks,lxk0f81,2024-11-17 01:05:14,The first few games I remember thinking ‘damn we might lose a lot but this at least looks like NHL hockey.’  Players seemed to be playing uptempo more aggressively and looking to make plays and it was refreshing compared to the last few years.  Now I watch the games and it’s back to the same old D first dump and barely chase bullshit.  This is obviously just conjecture but is it possible the players had confidence early on and had some belief in their collective talents and just went out and played hockey…until Richardson stepped in and reprimanded anyone playing outside of the system and neutered them?
hawks,lxh1rn0,2024-11-16 13:56:42,Who’s ready for a dump and chase zero puck possession and play defense only game from the hawks!
hawks,lxg639y,2024-11-16 11:07:01,Bedard gets a hattie this game Im calling it
hawks,lxjvnqd,2024-11-17 00:25:48,I’ve played devils advocate for Richardson all season long but shit dude. Something has to change. Easier to change a coach than trading everyone. Damn dude this isn’t just ineffective it’s boring af to watch.
hawks,lxjo75j,2024-11-16 23:26:37,"Someone please clip that ""you fucker"""
hawks,lxjvsd6,2024-11-17 00:26:53,Ima go play NHL 25 franchise mode and fire Richardson for no apparent reason.
hawks,lxje3qg,2024-11-16 22:15:32,Soderblom has been great this season. I feel like I should send an xmas card for all of my hate from last year.
hawks,lxjew6a,2024-11-16 22:20:46,#Mikheyev!
hawks,lxjexn1,2024-11-16 22:21:02,I love Foligno
hawks,lxjg5ol,2024-11-16 22:29:19,I like the improvement I’ve seen from 73 lately
hawks,lxjga51,2024-11-16 22:30:10,Woah big missed trip
hawks,lxjh3gg,2024-11-16 22:35:49,9 SOG in 15 minutes? Are they showing the right game?
hawks,lxjhwv2,2024-11-16 22:41:24,Bedsy 
hawks,lxjio9a,2024-11-16 22:46:28,bedard’s puck management the last two games has been less than ideal. the ice tonight has done him no favours but he’s jittery with the puck right now.
hawks,lxjizix,2024-11-16 22:48:34,Bedard is so deep inside his own head right now it's tough to watch. Hopefully he gets a greasy goal at some point soon and he settles down a little bit
hawks,lxjjvv6,2024-11-16 22:54:49,Binnys may be the official champagne sponsor of the Blackhawks but when I got my jersey retired I celebrated with my tequila el bandido.
hawks,lxjm44t,2024-11-16 23:10:59,Kaiser is legitThe d core development has surpassed my expectations this session
hawks,lxjn7ze,2024-11-16 23:19:10,Bertuzzi looks drunk tonight
hawks,lxjpf3b,2024-11-16 23:36:06,Bedard probably has a total of 1 minute in the O zone in the 2nd period
hawks,lxjplsr,2024-11-16 23:37:33,This 4th line’s been awesome give them the 1st line minutes
hawks,lxjsqj0,2024-11-17 00:01:39,Darren Pang comes off as a folksy grandpa but all his stories are about him getting tilted or golfing with all time greats.
hawks,lxjulkq,2024-11-17 00:16:57,Try Teuvo-Dickinson-Bedard
hawks,lxjwg4l,2024-11-17 00:32:24,Dump and chase the entire game I hate it
hawks,lxjo9uh,2024-11-16 23:27:12,Who’s a fucker?
hawks,lxjw89k,2024-11-17 00:30:36,Right on cue. Raise your hand if you knew this was going to happen.
hawks,lxjvuks,2024-11-17 00:27:24,I am once again asking for Luke Richardson to be jettisoned into Lake Michigan.
hawks,lxjwblt,2024-11-17 00:31:22,We might be close to having Richardson have to scratch Bedard for a game if he’s going to preach accountability.
hawks,lxjwlr1,2024-11-17 00:33:42,Completely uninspired hockey Richardson needs to go asap
hawks,lxjf05v,2024-11-16 22:21:30,Let's gooo
hawks,lxjf4hq,2024-11-16 22:22:19,Lets go!!!

hawks,lxjfqn2,2024-11-16 22:26:25,are my eyes deceiving me or are we finally not dumping it in every time
hawks,lxjga8n,2024-11-16 22:30:11,Panger exposing how Luke benches one of their best defensive forwards who gives 100% effort because of lack of points. Yes blame the third liner for losses Luke.
hawks,lxjgq3z,2024-11-16 22:33:15,Ice looks like shit
hawks,lxjh9nj,2024-11-16 22:36:59,Ref finally found his whistle
hawks,lxjikky,2024-11-16 22:45:47,I would like the Blackhawks to win
hawks,lxjlf6p,2024-11-16 23:05:50,I am 2000% sure that if given a chance to speak freely Bedard would just say something along the lines of “Stop featuring me every 5 seconds. I’m not playing that great and right now there are players here who are producing more and getting no such attention.”
hawks,lxjnikq,2024-11-16 23:21:23,Bedard getting a little time on the penalty kill would be a good experience in his development
hawks,lxjoihn,2024-11-16 23:29:02,Just cracked an imperial Czech lager. Holy shit they can make a beer over there.
hawks,lxjq4lc,2024-11-16 23:41:39,Gotta love the no-look passes into the middle of the ice.
hawks,lxju5s3,2024-11-17 00:13:20,Play bedard
hawks,lxjuvz9,2024-11-17 00:19:21,Best part of tonight is seeing Soderblom keep up the good play
hawks,lxjuykh,2024-11-17 00:19:56,These refs are fucking horrible 
hawks,lxjuzzg,2024-11-17 00:20:16,What the fuck?
hawks,lxjvtzr,2024-11-17 00:27:16,Empty net and an easy Vancouver goal incoming 3-1 Final. I've seen this movie before.
hawks,lxjwe13,2024-11-17 00:31:56,We can't even hold possession up a man
hawks,lxgzppa,2024-11-16 13:45:46,So last year we knew we’d lose most games but at least get some exciting plays out of bedard. Now the games are always closer but nothing exciting ever happens. I’d almost rather have it the other way lol
hawks,lxjvzmb,2024-11-17 00:28:35,I’ve been defending Richardson because I understand his intentions. But come on read the room dude. Your defensive fundamentalist regroup and dump and chase strategy isn’t working. A defensive mindset is good for team building but at this point it’s entirely just pissing us off and the players off too. This is an opponent who plays a grindy game and has a big defence core we can’t out grind them.
hawks,lxjwc34,2024-11-17 00:31:29,1 goal in regulation 5 games in a row
hawks,lxirpg7,2024-11-16 19:50:32,Just looked up how some of the CHL juniors prospects did last night and so far today. Alex Pharand with 2 goals and a helper for Sudbury in a 9-3 rout of Windsor last night. AJ Spellacy with 0's on the sheet for Windsor. Ty Henry with an assist in his Erie clubs win over Saginaw today. Nick Lardis with the hat-trick and an apple for 4 points today in a Bulldogs 5-3 win over Porter Martone's Brampton Steelheads.
hawks,lxjtbca,2024-11-17 00:06:18,Something’s gotta change
hawks,lxjv1d6,2024-11-17 00:20:36,Shocker 1 goal again and no offensive zone time for the Bedard line and they are -1 ...I think the pre game show needs to stop talking about him until he turns it around this is getting ridiculous
hawks,lxjw8ta,2024-11-17 00:30:43,Okay but if I was a fan of 31 other teams I’d find that absolutely fucking hilarious
hawks,lxjwhet,2024-11-17 00:32:42,CHGO podcast will still be defending Richardson tonight. Count on it.
hawks,lxjwkdb,2024-11-17 00:33:23,Let’s healthy scratch Richardson next game see what happens
hawks,lxjwsrv,2024-11-17 00:35:22,Now we wait for the trolls to show up at the post-game thread to gaslight all of us by saying this game was fun and the improvements are clear as day and it’s just bad puck luck.
hawks,lxjwp2l,2024-11-17 00:34:31,This is just the perfect culmination of why this year has sucked:-Endless dump and chase-Bedard is playing with linemates who don’t compliment his style causing him to make mistakes he shouldn’t be making-missed calls by the officials taking away vital powerplay opportunities -for some reason all of our goals coming from career bottom 6 players probably because of our line strategiesMan I’m tired of this. I get the point of playing a fundamental game but fuck off with it. It doesn’t work adapt. We aren’t looking for the second coming of Collitan where he just runs a strategy that doesn’t fit the team even when he knows it isn’t working.
hawks,lxj3vis,2024-11-16 21:07:31,I'm not a fan of 9pm start times.
hawks,lxjc8mi,2024-11-16 22:02:59,Rick Ball is a great announcer. Might be the Hawks best free agent signing this past off-season
hawks,lxjeip7,2024-11-16 22:18:15,Hey we actually get CHSN ota in Des Moines now! Let’s go!!!
hawks,lxjg40w,2024-11-16 22:29:00,Mikheyev was not the Vancouver boy I expected to be a monster tonight but I’m pleasantly surprised
hawks,lxjglp4,2024-11-16 22:32:23,Pang sounds like announcing from inside a can
hawks,lxji489,2024-11-16 22:42:43,Reichel refuses to be rocked!
hawks,lxji9oz,2024-11-16 22:43:45,Yikes Bedsy.
hawks,lxjitp9,2024-11-16 22:47:30,Thought we had a good period! Definitely more energy than the Seattle game.
hawks,lxjk325,2024-11-16 22:56:14,Was Rise Against in Vancouver?
hawks,lxjl7bj,2024-11-16 23:04:14,I hate the insane amount of comercials fuck that
hawks,lxjm06f,2024-11-16 23:10:10,Nice take down.
hawks,lxjm6br,2024-11-16 23:11:26,Good save by Sods there
hawks,lxjmvn1,2024-11-16 23:16:37,Bertuzzi has been baaaad
hawks,lxjn8d5,2024-11-16 23:19:15,Darren Pang no like math
hawks,lxjnnky,2024-11-16 23:22:27,So much reckless passing
hawks,lxjnog8,2024-11-16 23:22:39,Martinez in his few games definitely leads the team in pucks iced
hawks,lxjpe9x,2024-11-16 23:35:55,It’s about that time where we stop trying and dump the puck the rest of the game! See y’all on the other side
hawks,lxjt1ap,2024-11-17 00:04:03,Of course
hawks,lxjt3jr,2024-11-17 00:04:33,well fuck
hawks,lxjt56e,2024-11-17 00:04:55, Boooooo
hawks,lxjt7y3,2024-11-17 00:05:31,Horrible penalty to take
hawks,lxju8z2,2024-11-17 00:14:05,Trust me the hawks will get a penalty in the next 5 mins 
hawks,lxjuvmx,2024-11-17 00:19:16,Brannstrom is a pest tonight
hawks,lxjwc7y,2024-11-17 00:31:31,Bedard has looked like shit the past handful of games it might be time for a day off.Changing lines every fucking game first line is a fucking liability on defense and can't keep the puck.
hawks,lxgc2ju,2024-11-16 11:39:41,Wtf are these lines lol. Normally I understand what Richardson is doing in a lot of the line combos but why the hell is Bedard playing with 2 career 4th liners. I understand Donato he’s been an awesome pressure forward who can put the biscuit in the basket but that line needs a playmaker to make Bedard able to sneak away from the pack when he needs to. Instead Bedard is the only playmaker on that line and he’s probably going to get shutdown all night because of it.
hawks,lxjfgng,2024-11-16 22:24:33,Reichel is playing with so much confidence lately it’s awesome to see
hawks,lxji9u4,2024-11-16 22:43:47,bedsy's got the hometown jitters what the fuck was that
hawks,lxjmlbb,2024-11-16 23:14:32,Ray Ferraro shredding Kaiser for getting retribution for defending his goalie from Brannstrom going right at him after the whistle is the most Ferraro thing ever. Stfu
hawks,lxjv6zn,2024-11-17 00:21:54,Richardson when there’s a blatant missed call: 
hawks,lxjvbfp,2024-11-17 00:22:57,His goalie gets run over twice his players are getting held and tripped left and right and no call but Luke Richardson is still a fucking statue. 
hawks,lxjwces,2024-11-17 00:31:34,Fucking classic 24-25’ hawks loss
hawks,lxgd244,2024-11-16 11:45:02,This team should have their games aired on Comedy Central.
hawks,lxjw7yr,2024-11-17 00:30:32,Something is wrong with bedard
hawks,lxjvdh2,2024-11-17 00:23:26,Bedard is lost
hawks,lxjvh40,2024-11-17 00:24:16,Bedard didn't move his skates once while he had possession in the neutral zone. Sure enough it ended in a turnover. What exactly are these coaches telling him? That's just not acceptable.
hawks,lxjw7j6,2024-11-17 00:30:26,Yikes Bedard. This is painful.
hawks,lxjw6c8,2024-11-17 00:30:09,Bedard needs to sit. I hate to say it.
hawks,lxjhtd8,2024-11-16 22:40:45,Power play already looks better with out Jones
hawks,lxjt4sc,2024-11-17 00:04:50,My beer league team cleans the zone better than these “professionals”
hawks,lxjtca8,2024-11-17 00:06:30,Kurashev you fucking suck
hawks,lxjtjb9,2024-11-17 00:08:05,I know a lot of people are probably going to hate to say it but the D is missing Jones a little right now.
hawks,lxju3s0,2024-11-17 00:12:53,Can we get a coach that has a offense first mentality 
hawks,lxjunb8,2024-11-17 00:17:22,Yawn is every game gonna be boring like the last 2 years under Richardson 
hawks,lxjwc8z,2024-11-17 00:31:31,How many times will we whiff on a pass or shot?! It seems like near double digits every game at this point.
hawks,lxjw66j,2024-11-17 00:30:07,What the fuck is wrong with Bedard my lord
hawks,lxgigwf,2024-11-16 12:14:18,Just play better than the Seattle game.

hawks,lxjn4fk,2024-11-16 23:18:26,Richardson has broken Bedard
hawks,lxjtqwj,2024-11-17 00:09:52,I’ve seen enough of Luke Richardson
hawks,lxjbxxl,2024-11-16 22:01:00,I got a good feeling about tonight's game.

hawks,lxjhf6d,2024-11-16 22:38:03,Nyuk nyuk nyuk's goalie seems a bit shaky.  Keep shooting.

hawks,lxjq3jz,2024-11-16 23:41:25,I'll play devils advocate we can't even master the simple dump and chase so why should we try a more complicated entry? We don't have a skilled dman like Campbell who was a master at the zone entry we are just lacking skill in so many areas.
hawks,lxjqo2h,2024-11-16 23:45:49,Second half of the period was so boring
hawks,lxjt8d2,2024-11-17 00:05:37,Offensive zone penalty is such a braindead move

hawks,lxgooas,2024-11-16 12:47:17,Richardson must really hate Teuvo and Bedard and winning and Chicago for that matter
hawks,lxjq7up,2024-11-16 23:42:21,The Bedard line has zero impact. I feel like I’ve seen that line have the puck in the o zone maybe once tonight. So fucking frustrating. Bedard needs to have a shot quota in the double digits. Fucking Nick Schmaltz 2.0 Bedard was drafted for his shot and he doesn’t hit the net
hawks,lxjvbgn,2024-11-17 00:22:57,Pathetic display again

hawks,lxhm0cf,2024-11-16 15:46:20,[Per Ben Pope Seth Jones out with a right foot injury and Taylor Hall is scratched](https://x.com/BenPopeCST/status/1857878689146614042)
hawks,lxhs7q3,2024-11-16 16:20:08,Nolan Allen at least gets to play again after being scratched for the great and powerful tj brodie and the legendary and definitely not washed Martinez.
hawks,lxjihxl,2024-11-16 22:45:17,It kind of bothers me that Bedard fucks up and Panger is all praise for how well he fucked up. Quit that bullshit man. Call a spade a spade. The boy will make mistakes there’s no need to polish that turd.
hawks,lxjmf40,2024-11-16 23:13:15,I’m afraid period 1 was the one good period the hawks play each game
hawks,lxjmjqd,2024-11-16 23:14:12,Maybe Taylor hall got benched because he suggested the hawks practice breakouts and Luke blew his top.
hawks,lxjna0m,2024-11-16 23:19:35,17 games into the season bedard has 3 goals last year he had 9 at this point. Ugh
hawks,lxjqo3n,2024-11-16 23:45:49,Kane has puck possession and doesn't need alot of space so they would be perfect together cause there would be less focus on Bedard and Richardson will be gone soon and an offensive young minded coach should be hired.
hawks,lxjvtm9,2024-11-17 00:27:10,Bedard - Dickinson - Teravainen     why not at this point
hawks,lxjw6f7,2024-11-17 00:30:10,what the fuck was that
hawks,lxjudec,2024-11-17 00:15:04,I'm getting a little concerned with Bedard
hawks,lxjo33s,2024-11-16 23:25:46,Richardson has to go
hawks,lxjo472,2024-11-16 23:25:59,Kane would have been perfect on a line with Bedard should have kept him and let him learn under Showtime

hawks,lxjw6mo,2024-11-17 00:30:13,Fire Davidson and Richardson this team is a joke.
hawks,lxjc9qm,2024-11-16 22:03:11,Looks like I'm sitting this one out. Le sigh.
hawks,lxjfrr3,2024-11-16 22:26:38,Bedard still with the turnovers bruh
hawks,lxjia2i,2024-11-16 22:43:49,Fuck outta here with these turnovers Bedard
hawks,lxjm4eg,2024-11-16 23:11:02,Fine with that penalty

hawks,lxjolbk,2024-11-16 23:29:39,Shilovs blows bro his save percentage is .808 yet somehow he looks like prime Hasek
hawks,lxji989,2024-11-16 22:43:40,Hopefully Reichel gets a talking to. He’s getting caught looking at the puck a lot tonight with how fantastic he has been and with his confidence going up so much it would be absolutely horrible if he was to get hurt tonight from it.
hawks,lxjw5nd,2024-11-17 00:29:59,Seth jones play by bedsy right yikes he’s been horrific last few games
hawks,lxjw7g4,2024-11-17 00:30:25,How many empty net goals has bedard assisted on
hawks,lxieisu,2024-11-16 18:29:06,Hot take but with Seth out today with an injury we win. I think he's a great dude and solid player and I'm sure he's even a good locker room guy (which I think is super important) but something about him being out makes us win. Overpaid not his fault and we'd all take that contract for sure. But maybe it seeds resentment with other performers? Either way calling a win right now. Bedard 2 assists and 1 goal. Final 6-3 Hawks and a fun game.
hawks,lxjw6go,2024-11-17 00:30:11,Wow dude just wow. I'd sit his ass for a few games after this stinker. Horrible effort.

hawks,lxjehbk,2024-11-16 22:18:00,5 minutes of insanely sloppy and undisciplined hockey.
hawks,lxjf5o3,2024-11-16 22:22:32,Luke Richardson the only thing I’ll credit him is when he has a bad outing he will somewhat try to adjust if they can do this consistently the hawks will be fine

I was kinda on board with KFC's off-season dumpster diving moves the last couple of years to keep cap flexibility- until the Brodie signing.  He's been trash for years with absolutely putrid underlying numbers.  You have sub-replacement level dmen in Rockford that at least have a chance to grow into something with playing time.  No bueno
hawks,lxjwbew,2024-11-17 00:31:20,Bedard was benched for Canada in the offseason no? Maybe he needs to sit again

hawks,lxjj3dm,2024-11-16 22:49:17,Hard agree. Lotta moments I’d rather him shoot and he passes which gets broken up and turned over.
hawks,lxjjber,2024-11-16 22:50:50,A greasy goal is exactly what he needs.

hawks,lxjwekk,2024-11-17 00:32:03,Not yet bc he’s in a rebuild Davidson even said he’s safe for now
hawks,lxjxa9b,2024-11-17 00:39:22,I would consider the accountability to be on Richardson. McDavid also played like shit under a total defence system. It takes a good coach fit for a player to thrive and it’s not there right now. It cannot be a coincidence that all of our skills guys fucking suck.Hall is invisibleBedard is making mistakes he shouldn’t be makingReichel would be playing poorly if he wasn’t playing such a grindy gameKurashev can’t pass for shitTeuvo is invisibleAlso notice the total lack of physicality from the defence. The d core is huge and full of accomplished hitters. Murphy Kaiser Vlasic Allan Jones and Martinez have all built reputations around their physical presence and yet we only ever see an actual hit from those defence once in a blue moon. It’s a joke.These players should be leading plays and putting up points but they aren’t. It can’t be a coincidence. I understand Richardson wanting to build a defence first culture but sticking to a style that doesn’t fucking work is just plain idiotic. We are wasting our talent. You may as well just play 4th liners because those are the only players who are working in this system.
hawks,lxjwik3,2024-11-17 00:32:57,My exact thoughts. I think the pressure is getting to him. He hasn’t scored in a long time
hawks,lxk0bl0,2024-11-17 01:04:21,He’s safe this season but next season yea Davidson has to let him go if this continues plus I mean we could be worse
hawks,lxjnv2l,2024-11-16 23:24:03,Almost want them to take some defensive pressure off him until he sparks his offense again but agreed long term he needs time there

hawks,lxjtphw,2024-11-17 00:09:31,Rn not yet bc we weren’t supposed to be contenders coming into this season let’s see next season because Davidson gave Luke the benefit of a doubt since we weren’t gonna do well coming into this season.
hawks,lxjwn7r,2024-11-17 00:34:03,They’re a big part of my holding out on him. It’s getting fucking old
hawks,lxk0ct9,2024-11-17 01:04:39,He’s not getting fired at least after this seasob
hawks,lxjx16z,2024-11-17 00:37:20,They’re turning slowly. Slowly but it’s happening. The team just need to lose another few in a row so no one can posture  “where are the Luke haters at”
hawks,lxjwzqg,2024-11-17 00:37:00,The YouTube highlight watchers
hawks,lxjx7sp,2024-11-17 00:38:51,Richardson has the entire team playing like 4th line grinders absolutely insane what we are watching
hawks,lxjwucu,2024-11-17 00:35:44,Bedard is also very much responsible for those mistakes and lazy play
hawks,lxj6ptg,2024-11-16 21:26:19,Just got wings. Time to LOCK IN.
hawks,lxjc0km,2024-11-16 22:01:29,At least it's a weekend game.
hawks,lxjcco8,2024-11-16 22:03:45,He is
hawks,lxjewlz,2024-11-16 22:20:51,Do you get the MN Wild also?
hawks,lxjk61p,2024-11-16 22:56:49,If so was Corey Crawford also in Vancouver?
hawks,lxjmz1b,2024-11-16 23:17:19,worst game of the year for him so far
hawks,lxjv24w,2024-11-17 00:20:46,Someone needs to rearrange his face
hawks,lxh1vcp,2024-11-16 13:57:16,Richardson is anti offense only wants the forwards to play defense 
hawks,lxjiffh,2024-11-16 22:44:49,He’s had them for 5 games the hell man
hawks,lxjwxcs,2024-11-17 00:36:26,Maybe he needs to get laid
hawks,lxjwhfe,2024-11-17 00:32:42,Cockiness
hawks,lxjwatr,2024-11-17 00:31:11,Completely agree. He needs a hard reset.
hawks,lxjtj71,2024-11-17 00:08:04,I really don't like how bad he's been.
hawks,lxjtrg6,2024-11-17 00:09:59,Yea like I was honestly happy to see him gone so we can see this defense without him but it's just awful
hawks,lxgoaa7,2024-11-16 12:45:15,Hard not to looked as ugly as last season
hawks,lxiuuw7,2024-11-16 20:10:15,I have 5 on it!
hawks,lxjn75i,2024-11-16 23:18:59,Bedard needs to take some responsibility for his shitty play too

hawks,lxjqzit,2024-11-16 23:48:16,I don’t think it’s a matter of other entries being more complicated than a dump and chase or not but a matter of others entries needing more balls and this team is conditioned to play like cowards.
hawks,lxjr0b7,2024-11-16 23:48:27,>  master the simple dump and chaseI don't think this team has enough depth/talent and overall speed to do anything other than try and master the dump and chase
hawks,lxjwumj,2024-11-17 00:35:47,Bedard should scratch Richardson
hawks,lxjwdsd,2024-11-17 00:31:53,He absolutely should.
hawks,lxjwcv9,2024-11-17 00:31:41,Richardson will never hold players accountable.

hawks,lxjnhbq,2024-11-16 23:21:07,He’s playing a more defensive game. The offence game may look worse but the experience in a total defence system will make him a stronger player in the years to come.
hawks,lxjugiz,2024-11-17 00:15:47,Need a more offensive minded coach who will put bedsy in situations where he can succeed 
hawks,lxjuix6,2024-11-17 00:16:20,What you don't like turnovers and coasting?
hawks,lxjuvyy,2024-11-17 00:19:21,I’m not overlooking the turnovers being concerning but the guy isn’t getting fed any one timer oppos
hawks,lxjuza6,2024-11-17 00:20:06,He goes to fancy he acts like kane with the moves  but no finish in his second year
hawks,lxjuo75,2024-11-17 00:17:33,He has nothing around him can’t do it alone
hawks,lxjuz0i,2024-11-17 00:20:02,Look at it this way if bedard played like this previous season hawks would have celebrini ;)
hawks,lxjoivt,2024-11-16 23:29:07,But we can’t promote Derek King again to interm HC
hawks,lxjos1d,2024-11-16 23:31:05,Next season if we still are like this then yea we gotta get rid of him
hawks,lxjq26t,2024-11-16 23:41:07,Honestly with the system Luke Richardson wants Kane and Bedard would probably not work together considering neither of them would be winning pucks off the dump and chase or winning many board battles.
hawks,lxjp4e1,2024-11-16 23:33:45,I have the sense that Patrick Kane doesn’t play for the Blackhawks while Kyle Davidson is the GM.
hawks,lxjx2bm,2024-11-17 00:37:37,You think his dad is gonna give him shit at dinner?
hawks,lxjwb4y,2024-11-17 00:31:16,Davidson got the players for Bedard Lol Richardson This season he won’t get fired because we still in a rebuild however next season there a chance
hawks,lxjwptu,2024-11-17 00:34:42,This team is 2 to 3 years away from being good. If you didn’t know that you haven’t been paying attention.

hawks,lxjma78,2024-11-16 23:12:14,It's about sending a message I guess
hawks,lxjiiw5,2024-11-16 22:45:29,I think he’s just not shying away from contact not necessarily being caught with his head down
hawks,lxifm3u,2024-11-16 18:36:01,I really want this to be true but the metrics don’t lie. We are worse (by a lot) without jones one the ice.
hawks,lxixw85,2024-11-16 20:29:30,In the 15 game stretch where jones was hurt last season the hawks were 3-11-1 with a minus 30 goal differential…..
hawks,lxjcpr6,2024-11-16 22:06:12,There’s a 1 week trial that’s what I’m doing right now. Seems to work fine.

hawks,lxji516,2024-11-16 22:42:53,I disagree I like Panger
hawks,lxh6cko,2024-11-16 14:21:10,Are you smh Davidson gave His end of the deal he made moves to go get solid role players for the young guy Richardson yes he’s bad but I mean your gonna have to stick with him for now bc Davidson won’t fire him considering. We weren’t expected to be good this year
hawks,lxjv1p1,2024-11-17 00:20:40,I would disagree in principle due to the fact that he is leading the team in points.

hawks,lxik9db,2024-11-16 19:04:49,I've seen him play 4 times now for Rockford and really haven't been that impressed yet. He needs time
hawks,lxicg37,2024-11-16 18:16:07,So he can struggle and have his confidence tank? No thanks
hawks,lxjladp,2024-11-16 23:04:51,I thought it was his idea
hawks,lxjmp1x,2024-11-16 23:15:17,They lowballed him so he left
hawks,lxgiyy4,2024-11-16 12:16:58,But we’re gonna watch cause we love our Hawks :D
hawks,lxicubn,2024-11-16 18:18:34,According to Charlie Roumeliotis he’s not. Last year without jones for 15 games we went 3-11-1. This will hopefully show how much we actually rely on Jones
hawks,lxiismw,2024-11-16 18:55:47,It’s not addition by subtraction he eats minutes. But he isn’t worth half of what we’re paying.
hawks,lxjs7ub,2024-11-16 23:57:33,That’s deep in the lore.
hawks,lxjslzx,2024-11-17 00:00:40,Hey Richardson my son thinks your hockey system stinks
hawks,lxhk834,2024-11-16 15:36:38,"> Dude is playing with 2 career 4th linersWho both have more goals than Bedard this season. Hell ""4th liner"" Craig Smith has a career 215 goals / 440 pts. Donato may not be the most talented guy but he works his ass off and has been having a great season so far.The past several games Bedard has had Kurashev or Reichel or both on his line and the result has been what? Nothing.Teuvo has been a ghost since about the 4th game of the season the guys that can skate with Bedard and should be effective with him have produced nothing.So why not put 2 guys that have been playing well with him? Hell if it doesn't work you change it up. None of the lines have been set in stone this season and the game thread line up could be wrong."
hawks,lxjwai2,2024-11-17 00:31:07,Even worse for the damn white sox fans
hawks,lxjocwy,2024-11-16 23:27:51,Yeah a guy on my team did this to and was always a huge liability on defense or really locked in. Depended on the cart I guess.
hawks,lxjtf5m,2024-11-17 00:07:09,Wouldn't be surprised if we canucked these idiots with 2 minutes left
hawks,lxjtqkn,2024-11-17 00:09:47,The crowd that destroyed the city after losing the Stanley Cup is mild and mid?
hawks,lxjucbc,2024-11-17 00:14:49,It’s frustrating that they continue to dump and chase all game when they’re losing then wonder why they can’t score 
hawks,lxjuhw8,2024-11-17 00:16:06,Tonight? 
hawks,lxhrf5r,2024-11-16 16:15:46,The comic book guy from the Simpsons
hawks,lxh27d1,2024-11-16 13:59:01,That guy is in love with Seth jones and Luke Richardson. He’s schills for them so hard lol
hawks,lxghb6q,2024-11-16 12:08:05,I would even settle for a couple secondary assists at this point.
hawks,lxjkayf,2024-11-16 22:57:47,Chelis Chili! It’s just okay and very expensive for what it is. (A bowl of chili)

hawks,lxjvqms,2024-11-17 00:26:29,Exactly so let dicky take them bedsrd can figure it out in practice. Let teuvo & bedsy do their thing offensively and dicky can win faceoffs and fetch loose pucks for them
hawks,lxjo43y,2024-11-16 23:25:58,Yep itll also mean more steals and breakaways for him
hawks,lxjp3ho,2024-11-16 23:33:34,Trying to not tap into the liquor tonight
hawks,lxjufle,2024-11-17 00:15:34,Still love him with all my heart
hawks,lxjeiau,2024-11-16 22:18:11,That’s what I was hoping Tuevo would be after he matured in Carolina. We really need to find a Toews Replacement to help out with Bedard.
hawks,lxiwdlo,2024-11-16 20:19:54,Lard ass the greasy goal getter
hawks,lxjxrl7,2024-11-17 00:43:09,I think he’s stuck on the fact it worked decently well his previous seasons but he needs to understand this is an actual NHL team and not career 4th liners and AHL players.
hawks,lxjxy8z,2024-11-17 00:44:39,Fair but it’s possible he is discouraged. He is putting up worse numbers than he was at the end of last season even though he is a better player.The powerplay underutilizes him he’s rarely the sniper on any plays his linemates keep being shuffled and he keeps making mistakes. It all culminates and hurts one’s confidence.
hawks,lxjfhzo,2024-11-16 22:24:48,Not that I’ve seen but I’m not 100% sure
hawks,lxjuhkm,2024-11-17 00:16:01,with the exception of the foot goal Murphy and Vlasic have been pretty good

hawks,lxjnkwb,2024-11-16 23:21:53,He's a turnover machine
hawks,lxjur87,2024-11-17 00:18:14,Will have to see Kyle said he’s safe for now bc we weren’t gonna be contenders this year next year however if it continues then we can have this discussion again
hawks,lxjut4h,2024-11-17 00:18:41,He did more with less last year though..
hawks,lxjx84t,2024-11-17 00:38:55,Just lol some of y'all will forever give him a free pass. Brodie fucking sucks Bertuzzi is ass Martinez is a bum. Taylor Hall is so bad he's been scratched on this roster.  Teuvo is AWOL. He has kept Richardson as the coach.  He's had 10's of millions of dollars to improve this team and its simply not showing up.  You haven't been paying attention if you think the team being this bad after all his spending is acceptable.
hawks,lxjmcfh,2024-11-16 23:12:41,Better ways to do that
hawks,lxjivbd,2024-11-16 22:47:47,Not shying away from contact is taking physical punishment for making plays but he’s losing the puck because he’s not looking. He is playing like an absolute horse right now with puck battles and stuff showing he’s clearly not afraid but that doesn’t mean he can afford to be getting hit like he is.
hawks,lxiqi34,2024-11-16 19:43:09,It's an old fashioned find out! I want to be wrong but I also want a W

hawks,lxjvmr9,2024-11-17 00:25:34,I'll have some of that good shit man
hawks,lxioll3,2024-11-16 19:31:23,He had a solid game in their last one. Korchinski actually played really well too in that game. Check the highlights on the Ice Hogs YouTube.
hawks,lxjlfsz,2024-11-16 23:05:57,It was his brother is part of the Kraken organization.
hawks,lxjldzc,2024-11-16 23:05:35,I was like 100% sure he was forced out by big Dan
hawks,lxjniq8,2024-11-16 23:21:24,I mean the whole point of lowballing is to make sure the deal doesn’t go through without it looking like you’re the one who doesn’t want the deal done. He was lowballed *because* the Blackhawks didn’t want him around.
hawks,lxidt4h,2024-11-16 18:24:38,An a negative 30 goal differential. I probably just read that same pop up from Charlie .
hawks,lxjsatx,2024-11-16 23:58:13,I got a lot of problems with you people!
hawks,lxjtt8g,2024-11-17 00:10:24,The team owns/uses the goal song not the crowd. Try to keep up.
hawks,lxjul5r,2024-11-17 00:16:51,On the season. He's not even mid he's horrible but tonight he looks like Dominik Hasek against this team.
hawks,lxh84ft,2024-11-16 14:30:39,I think CHGO has to get some money from the hawks. They carry water for the organization heavy.
hawks,lxjpyj4,2024-11-16 23:40:18,Probably wise
hawks,lxjesrm,2024-11-16 22:20:08,Sasha boisvert!
hawks,lxixlft,2024-11-16 20:27:39,He scored his 100th OHL goal today
hawks,lxjglde,2024-11-16 22:32:19,Just figured so since you have the AHL Wild.
hawks,lxiv28d,2024-11-16 20:11:33,I was going to put more but decided the rest of the draft kings balance was better spent on John Jones. Bedard goal feels right today.
hawks,lxi2l6p,2024-11-16 17:17:26,>Richardson on Hall: “We want to get him more work and it’s hard to do that in games without getting too frustrated and chasing. That’s our plan. Players never like sitting out so he’s not happy but hopefully this is a big step for him and will help our team.”I'm not sure if I'm reading this correctly but he may be suggesting Hall is chasing the puck too much and winding up out of position because of it. I'm making big presumptions here.
hawks,lxiaazj,2024-11-16 18:02:42,He's had a pretty tough stretch of games lately. Not creating any real scoring chances and turning the puck over a ton.
hawks,lxjo1bj,2024-11-16 23:25:23,I hope they're blueberry I fkn love blueberry
hawks,lxjnvhy,2024-11-16 23:24:09,That means he can work on his defence /s
hawks,lxjjibm,2024-11-16 22:52:10,That’s true. He looks sturdy out there though. He got ran by branstrom and branstrom took the worst of it and blindsided by a 6’5 guy and shrugged it off.
hawks,lxjkm0n,2024-11-16 22:59:58,I thought that pass from Maroon set him up to get smashed. Otherwise I don't disagree with him not keeping his head on a swivel though. But other than that he has made a lot of solid plays otherwise tonight too.
hawks,lxjdp2v,2024-11-16 22:12:49,I meant to reply to /u/thethirdmannn
hawks,lxjfi7g,2024-11-16 22:24:50,Yeah I was there last night. I thought he looked better. I just don't think hes even close to being NHL ready
hawks,lxiuxdr,2024-11-16 20:10:42,Korch has looked very bad. Happy he’s turning it around.
hawks,lxjm57h,2024-11-16 23:11:12,I'd have to look it up but I thought I remember that they gave Edzo a low-ball low-term offer. There were other factors as well
hawks,lxjmfyg,2024-11-16 23:13:25,The story when it first happened was that they were deep in negotiations to renew his contract and the org was shocked that he chose to go somewhere else. I haven't seen much about it since then.
hawks,lxidv16,2024-11-16 18:24:58,For sure lol
hawks,lxju4r9,2024-11-17 00:13:06,Lol
hawks,lxjuphp,2024-11-17 00:17:51,That is really bad man is inconsistent but when he plays good he goes all out .
hawks,lxhg1hk,2024-11-16 15:13:41,"Especially with the whole ""Don't blame the Blackhawks Bulls or White Sox for the CHSN situation mantra."""
hawks,lxhtfih,2024-11-16 16:26:46,They are less reactionary but I don't think they are in the tank for the Blackhawks. They were less than kind to the team after the last postgame.
hawks,lxie9cv,2024-11-16 18:27:28,Maybe hall told him the hyper defensive style they play is stupid and luke got mad.
hawks,lxjdvog,2024-11-16 22:14:03,It’s okay :/
hawks,lxjeski,2024-11-16 22:20:06,Definitely. He legit had a great game.
hawks,lxjm7xg,2024-11-16 23:11:46,I knew it was something
hawks,lxjuqwu,2024-11-17 00:18:10,But that happens every 30 games 
hawks,lxhkw6j,2024-11-16 15:40:15,They’re sponsored by CHSN. Whenever anyone on the pod makes a comment about no one being able to watch Greg shushes them down.
hawks,lxhyi5o,2024-11-16 16:54:44,Even the greatest die hard fan would be pissed after that one to be fair.
hawks,lxii9hb,2024-11-16 18:52:27,Or he ate the last of Richardson's bran flakes and now he's in the dog house
hawks,lxjmdzt,2024-11-16 23:13:00,Don't quote me on that. I could be wrong. There was some weird stuff happening.
hawks,lxhnzqv,2024-11-16 15:57:05,I get that they’re sponsored by CHSN but I also couldn’t imagine how annoying it is to have someone comment under your tweet bitching about coverage because they confused CHSN and CHGO
hawks,lxi9eqh,2024-11-16 17:57:08,If they treated every loss like the end of the world and didn't put into perspective where this team is projected and what stage of the rebuild they are in that would be miserable commentary.
hawks,lxiiiiy,2024-11-16 18:54:02,He may have shit in his cornflakes.
hawks,lxibnkb,2024-11-16 18:11:10,They could also call out the team when it’s clear there are guys mailing it in instead of defending bad play.
hawks,lxiiw5q,2024-11-16 18:56:23,The Kevin Hayes classic
hawks,lxj1p9t,2024-11-16 20:53:29,When do they defend bad play? I can't recall a single moment where they have this season. I don't listen to every show though.
hawks,lxj2v19,2024-11-16 21:00:56,They are the number 1 podcast for the only thing( hawks) besides work school and life that I focus on so I listen to every pod. They don’t defend the players at all. They defend Davidson Richardson and the Wirtz fam heavy. They defend management not the guys on the ice.
detroitredwings,lxtpo1m,2024-11-18 16:45:41,I don’t know if the front office will want another first time NHL head coach. Our last 2 coaches have been rookies
detroitredwings,lxtl3z5,2024-11-18 16:22:36,I would be very interested in Carle. College doesn’t always translate to pros but he’s done an incredible job with Denver and he’s young enough that he relates better to players these days and could be a long-term guy for us (relative to normal coaching tenures).
detroitredwings,lxtmata,2024-11-18 16:28:36,As someone who lives in Denver and loves what he did at the WJC he’ll be fantastic…one day.But the NHL game is very different and his chance will be with a stripped down team rebuilding.
detroitredwings,lxtlbl3,2024-11-18 16:23:39,I’d be surprised if he left DU. The average tenure of a NHL head coach is only 18 months. He’s got incredible job security and a cushy job in DU
detroitredwings,lxtpj5y,2024-11-18 16:45:00,I’m hoping it’s Boudreau I think a veteran coach that has been around a long time and has a solid track record is what the team needs.
detroitredwings,lxttvhe,2024-11-18 17:07:11,Honestly the coach could be one of the dogs lyon drives on the dog bus for all I care at this point
detroitredwings,lxu31pq,2024-11-18 17:56:37,Yea no more rookie nhl coaches
detroitredwings,lxtl5wf,2024-11-18 16:22:51,It would be exciting if he came here next offseason. Friedman has said a few times he will be very picky on his move. So if he came to Detroit presumably he sees the potential that I know many are having trouble seeing right nowFootball fans especially will tell you though the NCAA to pro move is always a risky transition. The mechanics are so different a lot of people really fail
detroitredwings,lxtu21k,2024-11-18 17:08:09,I love Carle for the same reasons OP brings up here. That said does Chris Illitch open up the checkbook to pay him the premium he will want?
detroitredwings,lxtwnuh,2024-11-18 17:22:04,I say this as a Spartan fan I think Adam Nightingale would be fantastic. Has coaching experience at the pro level(Wings and Buffalo) would have his goalie in the system already. What he took over was a total dumpster fire and within 2 years they’re top 3 in the nation and rising. It’s just a matter of if he wants that at this time with family and stuff.
detroitredwings,lxtrgdv,2024-11-18 16:54:42,I’m just not sure going with three consecutive first time NHL coaches is a great idea. As an Alaskan I love seeing fellow Alaskans succeed and he and his brother Matt are viewed very warmly here for their achievements but I totally agree that it’s a different game to say nothing of his age. He’s only 35 which makes him younger than several Red Wings players. He’s poised to be an exceptionally successful coach for years to come I just think it’ll be a bit before he makes the jump to the NHL
detroitredwings,lxtvuxm,2024-11-18 17:17:44,Yzerman has only ever hired first time coaches AFAIK. Seems to be his MO.
detroitredwings,lxtmai0,2024-11-18 16:28:34,This photo is so strange. I'm assuming it's all real but there are so many parts of it that just look photoshopped. The size of that helmet hat thing. The position of Abby's face so Central and perfectly looking at the camera. There's just so much to take in hereGlad Abby is having a blast!

detroitredwings,lxub11z,2024-11-18 18:42:36,Non-Spartan and I totally agree with you. You absolutely cannot blame a guy for saying yes to the bag and like you said he played hard.
detroitredwings,lxtbnna,2024-11-18 15:35:09,Yzerman has taken us from a historically bad team with horrific contacts and a barren prospect pool to a team that has a legit shot at playoff contention and also has one of the deepest prospect pools in the league within the span of 5 years all without any sort of draft lottery luck.What he's done for us has been nothing short of incredible and the number of people hopping on the fire Yzerman train is shocking.
detroitredwings,lxtazin,2024-11-18 15:31:45,He's proven himself a quality GM in the league he should at least have the option to make one more coaching change he made a mistake with Lalonde but he still drafted well enough all things considered especially with the hand that he has been dealt by the Bullshit Lottery system. We just need someone to put it together And build a winning culture we can certainly be competitive with the talent on the roster. If his next coach fails then it's time to move on. 
detroitredwings,lxtelzi,2024-11-18 15:50:02,What I love about this pole right now is that it really gives me some hope that it's just the very vocal minority that wants Yzerman fired. It's about 2 to 1 in favor of not seeing a reason to fire him at the time I am writing this. That's still too much imo but at least it's on the right side of sanity.I'm obviously as frustrated as anyone with the current play of the team but practically I don't really see how firing Yzerman (or even Lalonde honestly but that tune can change as the season progresses) solves any of our problems. Building a contending team in the NHL is really hard to do. I'm not seeing any major whiffs from Steve at this time. The crazy thing to me is that hitting the panic button probably wouldn't even set this team back that far. It's not as though they're going to do a complete sell-off again. Our core is young four of Steve's first round picks are not in the NHL yet and we don't have any terrible contracts for any amount of term. Our worst contract is probably Copp and that only has two more years after this one . The cap is about to go up almost $10 million next year making that basically irrelevant.At this point for me Yzerman hasn't really put the rebuild into full gear yet. And I get that that's some people's complaint but I'm a little more patient than that. We haven't seen him make a real move to transform this roster. Right now it's literally composed of just his draft picks and a bunch of plug-in fillers until his other draft picks are ready. When Danielson ASP and Cossa (Maybe MBN too) are all in the show I expect either a bigger FA signing or a couple major trades to flush out the roster. That will probably be the point where it's safe to judge Yzerman.
detroitredwings,lxtrmhl,2024-11-18 16:55:34,As much as he wants.
detroitredwings,lxts4c0,2024-11-18 16:58:05,As long as he needs.
detroitredwings,lxth4r7,2024-11-18 16:02:37,Steve is the guy for the job. He’s done a great job digging the wings out of the salary cap hell holland left him with. I don’t love our coaching staff. The wings have had 2 coaches in a row without NHL hc experience. The team doesn’t start on time… ever. I think someone with experience behind the bench would help.
detroitredwings,lxtf0wc,2024-11-18 15:52:04,"Voted ""no need to fire."" The rebuilding draft and development have been spot-on. No critical assets have been given away and though there have been some bad contracts none affect the long-term outlook of the team. Many of the temporary plugs to fill the holes have been disasters particularly on defense and that's concerning for whether the team will be able to take the next step. Excellent FA signings or trades will eventually be necessary to complete a contending team and whoever we sign in two years can not look like Chiarot Petry Holl etc. That's not something to judge Yzerman on now we'll want to see what happens when the core is in the NHL."
detroitredwings,lxtagab,2024-11-18 15:29:01,Gave it end of 2027. Gives him time to bring in one more coach he wants and many bad contracts will be done
detroitredwings,lxtb0r4,2024-11-18 15:31:55,One more coach a couple chances to bring in the kids the ability to have a couple more bad contracts end the opportunity to liquidate our entire pro scouting division and bring in people who've seen their eye doctor more recently than 2019...
detroitredwings,lxtbm1h,2024-11-18 15:34:56,Yzerman has nailed his key decisions. The compete window was never going to be open right now but a strong prospect pipeline and a bunch of quality young player already seeing NHL minutes points to exceptional draft decisions.
detroitredwings,lxtg5jp,2024-11-18 15:57:43,This is pathetic this team is nowhere near being close to even being decent.Yzerman did so much more work in his drafts in Tampa and has made awful FA signings almost everywhere.In six years of drafting we finally have five total players on the team.I know he's Yzerman but please have some expectations.We're not just going to win the Cup the first time we make the playoffs with a bunch of kids.We need to make the playoffs by the end of next year (I'd say this year but our team is awful) or the man needs to be on the hot seat.
detroitredwings,lxtc6ua,2024-11-18 15:37:51,"Till our current top end prospects have a chance to enter the league get settled and have a chance to prove themselves. So I don't really have a definite term in years but it's kind of one of those ""I'll know it when I see it"" things."
detroitredwings,lxtues2,2024-11-18 17:10:01,It's so hard to tell because we have to hope every single one of our draft picks is a homerun steal because we'll never win the lottery draft. And we'll have to watch like 3 seasons for any draft pick to even see NHL action. And then another 2-3 years to see if they can develop into a star in the league. It sucks but it's almost impossible to judge more than just Stevies free agent signings. His free agent signings haven't been the best. But the haven't been the worst either. 
detroitredwings,lxtvtb0,2024-11-18 17:17:29,A lot. If you want 1st round level talent at most positions you’ve got to give him time to draft it. When the team is predominantly his picks then I’ll start judging him. Takes time to build a quality program from scratch. Ask Jim Harbaugh.
detroitredwings,lxtwl95,2024-11-18 17:21:40,As long as he wants. Sometimes you have to blame the players.
detroitredwings,lxu36xo,2024-11-18 17:57:25,I picked 'til the end of this season but just to be a hard ass.  I have high expectations Steve!  Win the damn cup.
detroitredwings,lxu7hl8,2024-11-18 18:22:03,I still love Yzerman. I do hope he starts to be a little more aggressive. Like firing Lalonde would be a great next step. I fully believe he has lost the locker room.
detroitredwings,lxtfrlv,2024-11-18 15:55:46,I'm skeptical of who he is choosing to keep in critical roles in this organization. If you're not getting absurdly lucky at the top of the draft you need better than average scouting to identify star players in the lower rounds of the draft. I wouldn't say our scouting has been exceptional it's been adequate. Our pro scouting has been mostly abysmal during Yzerman's tenure. I think Yzerman is a smart guy that knows hockey but his patience has turned to inaction at times. I'd give him a little more time to see his plan and his vision play out here and one more try at the rebuild but if he's just going to keep doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results then I think it would be time for a new voice. I'm very underwhelmed with the direction we're going in. I think 2-3 more years of mediocrity would probably get him a golden parachute. Any other GM I would have already been calling for their dismissal but for everything Yzerman has done in his career I think he deserves patience but there's a limit to that.
detroitredwings,lxtd238,2024-11-18 15:42:13,"For the ""I see no need to fire Yzerman at this time""  people I have a serious question for you. Have you seen this defense? Why do you feel like it's ok that Yzerman has done nothing but remove good players from the blue line?"
detroitredwings,lxtc41n,2024-11-18 15:37:28,Depends on what happens if they follow the trajectory they’re supposed to why fire him. If things go south why keep him? It’s all very dependant on time
detroitredwings,lxthbva,2024-11-18 16:03:37,If his draft picks end up flaking out that's when the hammer comes down.
detroitredwings,lxti9bp,2024-11-18 16:08:19,He has one coach firing after a Lalonde firing IMO (so two total).  Probably a couple more seasons to see how it pans out under a new coach assuming Lalonde is let go this season.  If the trajectory is upwards then he buys himself some time.  If the team is still stagnant or floundering in a couple years I think he'll be on the hot seat.
detroitredwings,lxtd1db,2024-11-18 15:42:08,He has until the end of this year they NEED to make the playoffs. If they don't make it I wouldn't be upset if he was let go.Lalonde is his guy.These are his signings.These are his draft picks.The product now is fully 100% Yzerman's team. Every bit of it and it's not making it happen.
detroitredwings,lxtgvkr,2024-11-18 16:01:20,"I'm in the until the end of next season boat right now. My main issues are Lalonde and it seeming like we don't have many options for improving the defense which has been bad for years now. I'm not as optimistic as others that this roster this year has any kind of shot at the playoffs. We also don't seem to be competitive in FA markets and most of our offseason signings have been busts. I keep hearing about all these prospects we have lined up but if they aren't better than what we're putting on the ice now or can't make it up on the ice now with the dismal roster we have I'm not sure how hopeful I am on them panning out. I'd also like to see a lot of the ""good ole boys"" cleaned out from the org and have some fresh new blood brought in especially in the scouting department.He gets at least another 1-2 seasons with a new coach and some of these bad contracts off the books to see how it works out. Lalonde's style of hockey is not the answer though which is why the jury is out. I don't know if we're just a bad team with a bad system or if it's the players being forced to play Lalonde's system that is making them look worse. Either way direct action needs to be taken this offseason whether through big FA signing or whatever to address this defense. Mo and Ed should be our core pairing but we need 4 other guys to go with them."
detroitredwings,lxten01,2024-11-18 15:50:10,People are watching the Lions and are now impatient even though the NFL has one of the fastest turnaround times and the NHL and is famously difficult to rebuild in. The game heavily relies on drafting. The designs of the salary cap and draft lottery make it very difficult to score premium talent if you didn't already luck into it and even scoring great draft talent can take several years to manifest.    And then you need a good goaltender or it doesn't even matter and there are only a few of those and is also famously difficult to find and the goalie's ability/success is extremely volatile unless they happen to establish themselves as a star. And on top of that like a quarter of teams are rebuilding at any given time so then you have to compete for resources with them.This shit is hard and relies on more luck than anyone wants to admit. The fact that we're even a fringe playoff team by now is remarkable given where we started.
detroitredwings,lxtimk6,2024-11-18 16:10:10,Ok let’s relax here. He has definitely improved the team since he’s been here but calling it “incredible” is a stretch.
detroitredwings,lxtge84,2024-11-18 15:58:55,We're currently a team with horrific contracts and we keep hearing about the prospect pool yet they're never good enough to come up to the NHL.It doesn't matter your age if you're good enough you should get a look.
detroitredwings,lxtlqli,2024-11-18 16:25:46,He has to have at least 1 good hit outside of the top 10 before I say he drafted well. A lot of it is time(his oldest class is only like 23) and we have some promising players so I’m not dooming. But I don’t think we can really say he has done well yet
detroitredwings,lxthfbv,2024-11-18 16:04:06,We're still a coach firing or two away from the rug being pulled out from beneath Steve.  Lalonde would be Yzerman's strike 1 since that was his first coaching hiring.  If another coach comes in and can't motivate this team that would be strike 2 or 3 for Steve depending on what else is going on.
detroitredwings,lxu0oth,2024-11-18 17:43:40,He’s also painted himself into a corner where he had to give away draft picks to move two contracts the he signed because we couldn’t afford to sign Raymond and Seider to long term deals (or signing a declining Tarasenko) without doing so. His cap management hasn’t exactly been stellar to this point.
detroitredwings,lxtatn0,2024-11-18 15:30:55,I think that's fair. There seems to be a tendency for people to lose patience with Yzerman who himself is a very patient person and always seems to catch everyone off guard when he decides to act.
detroitredwings,lxtd8oa,2024-11-18 15:43:09,You mean the bad contracts that Steve signed?
detroitredwings,lxtlmmr,2024-11-18 16:25:13,Our top three me prospects are 2nd and 3rd liners lol
detroitredwings,lxthpop,2024-11-18 16:05:34,My mom has been a fan/watching the Wings since the Olympia days. We were watching the game the other night and she asked me if all you had to do to work in this org was be a member of the 97-98 Cup teams and I had a solid laugh for a few minutes lol. We need some new blood especially in the scouting department.
detroitredwings,lxtdfrc,2024-11-18 15:44:08,That wasn't the option I picked but if I had to guess their perspective isn't necessarily that they're okay with the team as is but rather they are comfortable giving Yzerman more time to rectify things.
detroitredwings,lxtclb0,2024-11-18 15:39:54,>It's all very dependant on timeWell then how much time under the status quo?
detroitredwings,lxti6u8,2024-11-18 16:07:58,What horrific contracts? Yzerman hasn't signed anyone outside of Mo Raymond Larkin and Debrincat to anything longer than 5 years and none of those signings outside of Holl came at a cap hit higher than expected when we signed them.
detroitredwings,lxtpl8y,2024-11-18 16:45:18,Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure he said early in his tenure in an Interview that he doesn't choose the players outside of the top round the GM makes the first round picks and after that it's really up the scouts. But like u said it's a bit early to judge those mid round picks so we can only Judge him by the picks that have had the time to reach the NHL and in that regard they have been well received. 
detroitredwings,lxtmeer,2024-11-18 16:29:06,Very few GM’s get to fire 3 coaches without going themselves. Steve is a legend obviously so it makes it a little cloudy but I find it very unlikely he gets a 4th coach unless we make huge strides under the next coach.It would be different if he canned Blash right away but he didn’t it was 3 years
detroitredwings,lxtunhu,2024-11-18 17:11:19,I agree. To me it looks like there's a disconnect between Yzerman's and Lalonde's vision of the team and/or a disconnect between Lalonde and the team.
detroitredwings,lxte1lo,2024-11-18 15:47:12,I would argue that some of the contracts only seem bad because of the current coaching style. There are a few that I definitely don't love such as Petry and Gustaffson.
detroitredwings,lxtmcku,2024-11-18 16:28:51,This is true and has been the downside to the Yzerman regime. But I’m assuming he’s selling patients with the future/prospects. Many of the bad contracts holl chiarot and more were placeholders. Two years time you’d expect majority of the prospects to be in the lineup and show what they got at the nhl level. If it doesn’t look promising yzerplan has failed
detroitredwings,lxtd51k,2024-11-18 15:42:38,For Yzerman if they miss after next year. It’s time to move on. Not entirely because he did a bad job mostly because GMs don’t always have a bad shelf life. If he can get this team back into the playoffs and with a few Yzerman picks hitting of course keep him. But if he’s gonna sign more old players who have lost their touch he can go.
detroitredwings,lxtovjg,2024-11-18 16:41:41,Petry? Chiarot? Holl? Husso? Copp?
detroitredwings,lxtsd63,2024-11-18 16:59:20,Yes this is true but that is standard and he chooses the scouts philosophies etc. It’s the same with leading any organization sports or not. When we’re talking about GM’s we’re really talking about the regimeFor example another area generally not fully managed/watched by the GM is usually the salary cap and planning related to that. It’s such an intensive job(and honestly one most GM’s are unqualified for due to the legal and math skills required) that usually an assistant GM is in charge. Steve still gets final say but again that’s just how organizational hierarchies work. This is Aaron Khan for us and BriseBois in Tampa
detroitredwings,lxtmnb3,2024-11-18 16:30:21,Yeah but I think you can sorta make the argument that Blash wasn't his guy.  But Lalonde is and so is the rest of this roster.  So the clock is already ticking but I wouldn't say his seat is warming until Lalonde is out the door.
detroitredwings,lxtgkfn,2024-11-18 15:59:46,which FA deals have actually been good? A handful.
detroitredwings,lxtu60i,2024-11-18 17:08:43,Petry and Husso are done after this year both got short-term low-AAV contracts. Husso has struggled to stay healthy but hasn't been horrible.Copp was coming off of a good year with the Ranger and is a center. He got paid market rate for his position for only 5 years. That's not a horrific contract by any stretch of the imagination. Has it paid out well for us? Not really but it's not going to cost us too much to move him if needed.Holl and Chiarot are done after next year. Chiarot got around the market rate for a 2nd pair d-man. He hasn't been awful. Holl wasn't a great signing but the term was short so there's that. Again not horrific contracts.There's aren't horrific contracts. They were short-term stop gaps that allowed us to field an NHL caliber team while our prospects develop in an environment that isn't complete booty.
detroitredwings,lxtmyw9,2024-11-18 16:32:00,Sure but 3 years I mean it’s hard to say you weren’t choosing himI definitely agree though that right or wrong his clock isn’t ticking until he fires Lalonde
detroitredwings,lxtjkz1,2024-11-18 16:14:55,And I'm just saying I think it seems that way because Lalonde's coaching a system which doesn't allow any of our players to thrive.
detroitredwings,lxtap1u,2024-11-18 15:30:16,Good luck man. I have season tickets and also trying to get rid of this game.
detroitredwings,lxtke5g,2024-11-18 16:18:59,"Lalonde:* Ras in for Motte * Ed good to go Lagesson was just a fallback in case* Need to get back to not giving up easy offense (against) on the rush* Need to watch the forecheck against us tonight* Want more sustained offense and possession* Happy for Walman need to keep him out of the play tonight* 2-2 road trip important compared to 1-3 (Mo said same thing)Kane:* Not much but when asked about how the team could improve he said he's starting with himself and knowing that he needs to be better. I'm probably reading into it a hot but saying that in the locker room seems to suggest that there is a similar need in a few spots around the lineup and that guys have to dig in.Mo:* Mentioned importance of a .500 road trip* Also mentioned the rush and easy goals* Need to come up with some goals* Wants to sustain more offense and pressure and more of ""our game"""
detroitredwings,lxt75gj,2024-11-18 15:12:06,Detroit had a big turnout last year and it was a blast so I’m not surprised to see another one here. Excited to go!Also let’s get an expansion team 
detroitredwings,lxt9qsh,2024-11-18 15:25:25,Hell yeah get the fan turnout so we can get a team!
detroitredwings,lxte9vt,2024-11-18 15:48:22,Hell yeah. Lets break last times attendance
detroitredwings,lxu0dve,2024-11-18 17:42:02,We need the Detroit Vipers to come back
detroitredwings,lxtztgh,2024-11-18 17:39:00,Asking all of my Michigan friends to do a favor. I need a PWHL team for Detroit. :)
detroitredwings,lxuabyy,2024-11-18 18:38:32,I’m planning on taking the family! The last one looked like a blast
detroitredwings,lxu8wti,2024-11-18 18:30:15,I wouldn’t entirely be against our PWHL team being named the Vipers. It would be a nice homage to the IHL while also bringing back THE best logo in hockey. 
detroitredwings,lxt2tnx,2024-11-18 14:50:04,Now the fun part where do we send him? GR or Toledo?
detroitredwings,lxt3p9g,2024-11-18 14:54:30,He was in Grand rapids I thought?
detroitredwings,lxtgucl,2024-11-18 16:01:10,You'd have to think Toledo.I can't see them shelving Cossa and rotating 3 goalies is never ideal
detroitredwings,lxt4z6r,2024-11-18 15:00:54,Husso is also in GR and is clearly too good for the league but he also can’t seem to stick in the NHL. He’s only played 4 games but has only allowed 5 goals in those 4 games. .952%/1.46 GAA. Cossa has been getting the majority of the starts. He has 11 games played and has also been fantastic. 20 goals total allowed. .937%/1.89 GAA. Cossa is gonna keep getting the majority of the starts so it doesn’t really make sense to have both Husso and Campbell there. There’s not enough starts for both of them.
detroitredwings,lxt47ur,2024-11-18 14:57:07,Cossa and Husso are there
detroitredwings,lxsmatm,2024-11-18 13:27:11,The Pistons have a coach who the players are motivated by and want to play for. Lalonde has never been that and never will be. They need a change and badly. Look at the Lions and what a coach can do for players. This team will not win anything with him as the captain of the ship.
detroitredwings,lxsry0i,2024-11-18 13:55:24,"""I love Coldplay."" - LarksI love you Dylan Larkin and I've been a defender/huge fan since you were drafted but we're gonna need you to stop listening to Coldplay and get with Dan Campbell's playlist. I'm sending you a mix CD and it's 100% thrash."
detroitredwings,lxsmns8,2024-11-18 13:28:57,The Wings are the oldest worst and least exciting team in the city. I wish I was being negative but that’s the reality.
detroitredwings,lxsm6t6,2024-11-18 13:26:37,To be fair the Pistons had nowhere to go but up.  They won only 14 games last season.  Based on the moves the Wings made (or didn't make depending on your opinion) they were going to take a step back this year.  The blame goes to Yzerman and the rest of the front office for that.  Lalonde's coaching hasn't helped matters either but he is trying to win with the team that Yzerman and the front office assembled for him.
detroitredwings,lxtcvpg,2024-11-18 15:41:21,My only argument here is that hockey is easily the most difficult sport to build a contender in. The limited cap makes it extremely difficult IMO and even when you do build a super roster (like the Leafs for example) there is still no guarantee you will win a Cup.MLB you can basically buy a winning roster.NBA is really built through draft picks similar to hockey but much smaller rosters compared to hockey. So if you hit with your lottery pick and snag a couple of role players you can easily make playoffs. NFL has so many factors. Enormous rosters. Tough if not impossible to win without a really really good QB and elite players in several other positions. Anyway there is a lot wrong with this Wings team right now and I'm not really sure where to even begin to move forward. I think overall this roster is just kinda ass and a lot of the guys we need to show up and at least play average are playing well below average instead.
detroitredwings,lxsok4h,2024-11-18 13:38:31,Can we stop signing old players who are at a fraction of their once playing level? Talbot aside these signings are getting harder and harder to try and justify what the fuck Yzerman is thinking... and I am the biggest yzerman fan.   Dont even get me started on Lalonde aka Blashill 2.0
detroitredwings,lxsy4dj,2024-11-18 14:26:19,My opinion is the wings lack leadership because we swap out the veterans every year via FAs so im assuming the locker room culture is just full of FA mercenaries
detroitredwings,lxswhfl,2024-11-18 14:18:06,"Imagine justifying this by saying the ""Pistons had no where to go but up"" lmao. These mfs saying that have clearly not been paying attention to Pistons basketball for the last 6+ years which is fine but no this franchise most certainly could've been worse and the results of the past decade can attest to it."
detroitredwings,lxsmm2j,2024-11-18 13:28:43,If they don’t get there balls back soon it could be like that the rest of the season Lolande is not that guy “Larks your great go show it” “Larks your not on the level with other greats no offense go have a solid 200ft game” 
detroitredwings,lxsqwa3,2024-11-18 13:50:15,We’ve seen what a loser mentality can do to a team. The Pistons to their credit shitcanned a coach when he had *one* bad year and was on a multi-year contract. They also filled their roster with vets who can contribute. Their star player(s) are also improving year after year.Lalonde is a garbage coach teaching the team bad habits and saying dumb shit in the media. They signed horrible veteran after horrible veteran. And their young stars are not improving - simply treading water.As of right now the Pistons have surpassed the Red Wings in their rebuild. As much as that fucking sucks to admit.
detroitredwings,lxsnwsa,2024-11-18 13:35:15,Tiny payroll if you only count the guys that were on the field in the playoffs. If you look at the payroll at the start of the year it was middle of the pack.
detroitredwings,lxt4pos,2024-11-18 14:59:34,The locker room after that Chicago win was jarringly dull. I don't know what I expected having never played sports at even a collegiate level but the leading voices were kinda flat. I won't jump to conclusions but it did make we wonder if they need to start communicating differently and maybe injection of intensity. This is the kinda thing I miss from Perron this year.
detroitredwings,lxtvern,2024-11-18 17:15:20,I hate to say it. But the Yzerplan may not be happening. We gave it many years. But something is just always off with them. 
detroitredwings,lxte1bl,2024-11-18 15:47:09,"""This roster plays without heart doesn't have on-ice leadership""I think this right here is the key statement and I feel like this is a primary task of the head coach.  Lalonde does not have the team on his side it seems.  An injured Larkin last year is a perfect example of this.  The way I see it the team completely fell apart without Larkin because they do not have a coach that they believe in or trust."
detroitredwings,lxsu3ow,2024-11-18 14:06:13,I just wanna say there was a Wings game a couple weeks ago where they showed some locker room team building bullshit LaLondes got going on where the player of the game gets to put a sticker on a random football helmet that they all share (sort of a play on what college football teams do for achievements). Either way it was lamest saddest most uninspired pathetic bullshit I’ve ever seen in a locker room. The video I saw was a completely monotone Larkin putting a sticker on a football helmet and then handing it back to LaLonde in front of a dead quiet locker room. We can blame Yzerman and the front office for building this team and certain players for not fully stepping up but LaLonde has completely lost the locker room. At the very least a coach needs to have a basic understanding of what makes their players tick and LaLonde probably couldn’t find the pulse of his own heart if he tried.
detroitredwings,lxt2w00,2024-11-18 14:50:23,I feel like way too much is riding on a November 18 game tonight.
detroitredwings,lxt6t5i,2024-11-18 15:10:19,They might be the worst now but they’re still the last one with a championship (hopefully that changes in February)
detroitredwings,lxso605,2024-11-18 13:36:32,"Ignoring individual contacts of each team I think it's pretty unanimously. Understood that it's far easier to turn around success in an NBA organization than it is in. Essentially any other sport. There's lots we can talk about regarding how and why and what is happening with each team at the moment but no one should be surprised to see wild swings and performance from an MBA team from season to season. The variables are entirely different and the impact on any one individual person from the coach down to a player is dramatically different than any other sport. Certainly the NHL. That being said it's nice to see the Pistons off to a good start. They really had almost nowhere to go but up but that's been said for a few years and it's good to actually see it happening early on.But ""pistons being left out on all the Detroit sports fun"" memes are going to need the logos swapped soon if the current trends continue."
detroitredwings,lxsrpg0,2024-11-18 13:54:14,The Pistons also play basketball whereas the Red Wings play Ice Hockey.
detroitredwings,lxss42r,2024-11-18 13:56:15,Imagine comparing hockey to basketball. The only similarities are the length of schedule and that they are both team sports.
detroitredwings,lxt0ioo,2024-11-18 14:38:23,This sub is hilarious. The Pistons and Red Wings situations have far more in common than they do differences. Let me explain.I bet most aren't aware of this stat: Last season the Pistons averaged 109.9 points per game. This season the Pistons are averaging 109.6 points per game. The change in their record is largely due to two factors. For one while they are still getting outscored on average they are playing better D so the score gap isn't as large. Last year they were giving up 119 points a game and that is down to 110.2 per. The other difference? Stop me if you've heard this one before but the Pistons brought in several aging vets to plug holes. Players such as Tobias Harris (age 32) Malik Beasley (28) and Tim Hardaway Jr (32). When it comes to core players to build around it is really still just Cade and Ivey. So what you're getting with the Pistons is better than what they had before but basically the basketball version of last seasons Red Wings team. There are some good young players on the team but they also dress several veteran plugs just filling holes and they're still getting outplayed on average. They are not as good as you think are meaning the rebuild has a long way to go.
detroitredwings,lxt2x6f,2024-11-18 14:50:33,God this is true. There's a reason Scotty was so successful.   You wanted to win for him...or he'd kill you.
detroitredwings,lxt32ub,2024-11-18 14:51:20,I’m usually reticent to call for a coaching change so soon but I agree. I have no idea why Lalonde was brought in when he clearly can’t motivate this locker room.
detroitredwings,lxu1tgq,2024-11-18 17:49:50,Not saying I disagree at all but this has always been so fascinating to me. These are grown men playing for a lot of money playing for their jobs. Why do they need one single person at the coaching position to motivate them to play hard? They should be able to do that on their own imo
detroitredwings,lxss510,2024-11-18 13:56:23,Does he really listen to Coldplay?  If he does this explains everything about him.
detroitredwings,lxst2jg,2024-11-18 14:00:59,100%
detroitredwings,lxtno3b,2024-11-18 16:35:34,It was the reverse for many years.  The Wings were the only Detroit team worth watching (I admit ignorance of basketball don’t watch it)
detroitredwings,lxsuscd,2024-11-18 14:09:38,Facts.
detroitredwings,lxsvioo,2024-11-18 14:13:17,Lalonde isn't trying very hard.  We've got historically bad PK historically bad number of giveaways non-existent 5-on-5 offense goals against per game that's only slightly better than last year shots per game down to worst in Wings' history etc.  Only good thing is the PP which is one of the best in the league.  But credit there goes to Tanguay.
detroitredwings,lxsmuke,2024-11-18 13:29:54,The Wings in my opinion didn't lose anyone that I'd judge to be a core player.  They lost roster filler.  The core players (Larkin Raymond Kane Debrincat) aren't doing much at all.  Tarsenko has been a complete bust.  Although Larkin has a bunch of PP goals he is mostly invisible out there.  Seider is definitely a core player and he doesn't look perfect either.  But I'll give him a pass since he plays nearly half the game and has been partnered with people like Ben Shart (oops Chiarot) or Edvinnson who is very good but still a rookie.
detroitredwings,lxt77v1,2024-11-18 15:12:26,I don't think that's fair - they could have stayed the same. Instead they're improving. Wings are regressing.
detroitredwings,lxsxvd1,2024-11-18 14:25:04,I mean he’s signing who he can get. I don’t get this argument. No one is being blocked!!!!!! Danielson ASP buchelnikov Mazur Lombardi wallinder and cossa aren’t ready yet. Look at San Jose and buffalo. Are they really setting themselves up for success throwing a bunch of 19 year olds out there with no proven Stanley cup experienced players? The young players getting to learn from Kane Perron fabbri chiarot l Petry Maata will set these guys up better in the long run. It takes longer in hockey than any other sport. Ottawa Detroit and buffalo will all be good but everyone is losing patience in all 3 of these orgs because it just takes longer in hockey.
detroitredwings,lxsp68h,2024-11-18 13:41:36,Those guys are meant to be stopgaps until young players develop.  The problem is that the stopgap players aren't performing or were never good to begin with and the young guys aren't showing up.  I like both Kasper and Edvinnson but they are far from being impact players at this stage of their development.
detroitredwings,lxsp8wa,2024-11-18 13:41:59,The Yzerplan isn't going to plan.
detroitredwings,lxst9w9,2024-11-18 14:02:01,Blashill was a better coach then Lalonde is and he had a quarter of the talent Lalonde does
detroitredwings,lxtcjxe,2024-11-18 15:39:42,Part of it seems to be circumstance for better or worse Trouba was apparently supposed to come. I also don’t doubt we struck out on a few big UFAs this off season given the rush to move money
detroitredwings,lxsynay,2024-11-18 14:28:57,The have been trading in old roster filler for new roster filler.

detroitredwings,lxsn54t,2024-11-18 13:31:23,Larkin some nights is an amazing 200' player and he looks like a superstar.  Most nights he barely shows up or he somehow gets a goal in an otherwise lackluster game.
detroitredwings,lxsxh5r,2024-11-18 14:23:05,> The Pistons to their credit shitcanned a coach when he had one bad year and was on a multi-year contract.Not only multiple years but he was the highest paid coach in the league when he signed. They paid a hefty price to get rid of him but it was totally the correct move.
detroitredwings,lxtcd0o,2024-11-18 15:38:44,And in Sacramento if we’re talking basketball Mike Brown brought a culture change. Not just a stylistic one that helped them get good again
detroitredwings,lxt3zrr,2024-11-18 14:55:57,Not moving on quickly from people who are bad at their jobs is what makes rebuilds take even longer and cause fans to lose interest. It’s been clear for awhile that Lalonde is not good but we’ve now given him almost three full seasons to figure that out.
detroitredwings,lxtfclv,2024-11-18 15:53:41,The on-ice leadership is Larkin.  They absolutely did fall part without him last year.  This year they are falling apart with him.  Give Seider and Raymond each an A already.  They are the future.  They bust ass.  Maybe Larkin is carrying too much of the burden I dunno.
detroitredwings,lxt3mkx,2024-11-18 14:54:07,There's no ballast in the room. Larkin is low-key. Lalonde is low-key. Cat is low-key. The kids are all low-key. That's why losing Perron hurts. He was their only yapper.
detroitredwings,lxt74m6,2024-11-18 15:11:58,"I couldn't have said it better. If Red Wings fans want people to stop chanting ""JARED GOFF"" at games then we're gonna need our legendary hockey team to start biting some kneecaps or whatever their version of ""DON'T LET THE TIGERS GET HOT"" would be. I was a Lalonde defender for a while but his media comments do not inspire confidence to the point of players publicly pushing back.I'm a ride or die so I'll be along for the inevitable lows but holy shit I'm lost right now as to the direction of the team."
detroitredwings,lxsshz7,2024-11-18 13:58:08,Damn we got Alfred Einstein here.
detroitredwings,lxssd9d,2024-11-18 13:57:30,"Dude I'm comparing team performance across the four major sports in Detroit.  And I've played coached and reffed hockey so I'm confident that ""I get it"" when it comes to hockey."
detroitredwings,lxtxonk,2024-11-18 17:27:32,Scotty had rings and won a lot when he was a young coach. Back then he was a real hard ass. But he was a winner so the players went with the flow. Later on and by the time he came to the Wings he had mellowed out a lot. But at that point he was already a legend and players had heard all the stories so they didn’t want to let him down. For some it was fear but really it was more to be a part of his hemisphere. I can’t remember hearing any stories about him blowing up or being a hard ass. From what I know he was pretty quiet and didn’t chew the fat with any players except Hull. He had rules and policies and he was set in his ways but he wasn’t harsh or unfair. I’ve heard some stories that made him sound wildly human and you would never think that’s how certain things unfolded. He had plans but sometimes he would gamble in a shrug your shoulders kind of way. Beyond his stubbornness sometimes he would act as if “why not?” Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn’t.
detroitredwings,lxu2q8w,2024-11-18 17:54:51,Because they get paid regardless of outcome. Their check doesn’t change if they play great or play terrible. You gotta get purple to buy and and want to win if you can’t do that you’re a bad coach. That’s literally the coaches job.
detroitredwings,lxsxnj7,2024-11-18 14:23:58,What a weird take
detroitredwings,lxsvsr0,2024-11-18 14:14:40,[https://youtu.be/AtP6uxFaZko?si=YwP3W6JqSHKVQXR2&t=899](https://youtu.be/AtP6uxFaZko?si=YwP3W6JqSHKVQXR2&t=899)
detroitredwings,lxsy1fh,2024-11-18 14:25:54,I am not saying that Lalonde is doing a bang up job but Yzerman deserves some of the blame here.  This team took a step back and the front office should take some responsibility.  I am sure that Lalonde will probably be fired this season.  I just don't know when it will happen but I also don't expect it to change the team's performance much.  They could put Scotty Bowman on the bench and he wouldn't be able to do much better with this team.
detroitredwings,lxsq7k7,2024-11-18 13:46:50,Hard to blame Larkin Raymond and Cat. All are hovering at career bests in some capacity. The reason we were good last year was because of the depth we had. We got a lot out of Ghost Sprong Perron even Fabbri. We lost all of that production. The 2nd and 3rd lines are horrible now. Outside of our top pair we don't really have a good puck mover. The team is poorly built and can't really be coached to do a certain thing because there's really no identity.
detroitredwings,lxsvtv8,2024-11-18 14:14:50,Perron was criminally underrated by people that don’t understand hockey. ESPECIALLY considering his strengths (puck possession board battles slowing the game down in the o zone) were the things the wings are the worst at. That’s why I was worried when we lost him because we already sucked at cycling in the o zone even WITH Perron. I mean look at how bad our 2nd line has been without him.
detroitredwings,lxssxwp,2024-11-18 14:00:20,When are we going to acknowledge how much Seider has stagnated in development
detroitredwings,lxt9fuj,2024-11-18 15:23:51,The Pistons are indeed improving but when you only win 14 games your young players are bound to improve.  The Wings are indeed regressing but we won't regress that much from last year.  Maybe 5-6 win difference from last year?
detroitredwings,lxstfia,2024-11-18 14:02:49,Yup this is it and lets be honest with the prospects we have multiple players are going to need to over perform/exceed projections for this team to be truly competitive in the coming years. I like our prospects but with the exception of maybe ASP none look like world beaters or the elite talent some other teams have lucked into.
detroitredwings,lxsu93t,2024-11-18 14:06:58,Cant argue that at the moment.
detroitredwings,lxt2mak,2024-11-18 14:49:01,I have been going to all the games since the Joe and the teams under blashill were way more entertaining to watch than the teams under Lalonde. Blashill had teams with very little talent but they played together better and they looked like they were trying harder.
detroitredwings,lxsnxlt,2024-11-18 13:35:21,I’m illiterate mb
detroitredwings,lxsnt20,2024-11-18 13:34:44,Some’s up the whole offensive group right now and arguably the defensive group not moving the puck wellI used to defend lolande but your job as a coach is to rally your players pros or not If your coach doesn’t address the team after a loss then something’s not going right and our play is evidence of that.
detroitredwings,lxsydls,2024-11-18 14:27:36,Monty didn’t even want the job to begin with but couldn’t refuse when Gores backed up the Brink’s truck in his driveway.Pretty sure he was basically trying to get himself fired last season.  Now he gets to coach his sons’ basketball team and he’s set for life from the Pistons contract.
detroitredwings,lxth9yt,2024-11-18 16:03:21,Yep I know it's Larkin.  I kept it in there but admittedly didn't address it.  The head coach should be the one that is recognizing who is showing leadership among the players and assigning A's as appropriate.  So I feel like the lack of on-ice leadership is because of Lalonde.  I don't think we can ask Larkin to carry the weight of the team.  And guys like Chiarot don't seem to fit the bill.
detroitredwings,lxsx53p,2024-11-18 14:21:24,It's Albert Einstein lol. Sorry not trying to be mean just had to jump at the chance.
detroitredwings,lxst172,2024-11-18 14:00:48,You made the mistake of saying something that could be conceived as insulting Stevie so you’llbe attacked. There is every excuse in the book for him right now but either way it appears that the wings have now been relegated to the 4th best team in the city. This has no impact on his long term success and hope beyond hope he’s the guy but it’s frustrating as hell.
detroitredwings,lxst3sw,2024-11-18 14:01:10,“I’ve played coached and reffed hockey.” That’s cute but I don’t remember asking.
detroitredwings,lxu4yz3,2024-11-18 18:07:30,I mean that’s just a bad look on the players if they don’t have the heart and competitiveness to play hard on their own. At the end of the day you’re the only person who can motivate yourself to do something
detroitredwings,lxsyt0x,2024-11-18 14:29:44,You must like Coldplay
detroitredwings,lxsz9z5,2024-11-18 14:32:06,Parachutes is my all-time very favorite album of any genre.Imo A Rush Of Blood To The Head is one of the greatest albums ever made in the entire history of music.Viva La Vida was an excellent album even though it wasn't what I expected or the exact sound style and vibe I prefer; but it's still one of my favorite albums too.
detroitredwings,lxt5k8u,2024-11-18 15:03:54,I agree. Lalonde should probably go but this roster is ass right now
detroitredwings,lxt6bpn,2024-11-18 15:07:50,Disagree on that final point. Scotty was able to turn an offensive-focused Wings team into a team that actually plays defense something we're sorely lacking currently.
detroitredwings,lxszqt8,2024-11-18 14:34:28,Brutal
detroitredwings,lxt5nj6,2024-11-18 15:04:22,The irony is that we signed all these veteran filler roles in hopes to build a semi-winning culture for the young guys to develop in.  And now that we're nearly out of cap space because of these signings the Wings are one of the worst teams in the league right now.
detroitredwings,lxsqtt5,2024-11-18 13:49:54,Regardless of stats not Larkin Raymond or Debrincat aren't consistently doing much at all.  A guy like Larkin should be noticeable every time he steps on the ice.  At least Raymond is playing with grit and heart.  I can't say that about the other two.  With Larkin Raymond Kane Debrincat Tarasenko and Kasper the Wings should have two good lines.  Instead they have zero good lines.
detroitredwings,lxt54bk,2024-11-18 15:01:38,Perron almost put us into the playoffs with that clutch goal. He was loud and he had experience. A lot of qualities that made up for his age and the bonehead penalties but I wish we still had him.
detroitredwings,lxt5sle,2024-11-18 15:05:06,Perron was one of my favorite players last year. Tarasenko has not been better than he was.
detroitredwings,lxt5737,2024-11-18 15:02:01,No
detroitredwings,lxttodc,2024-11-18 17:06:09,I still don't agree with your logic just because a team is (very very) bad doesn't mean they will definitely improve the following year even if the bar is extremely low. They're looking drastically better.
detroitredwings,lxstqmw,2024-11-18 14:04:24,Our lottery draft luck has sucked also.  That has real consequences.
detroitredwings,lxszb6o,2024-11-18 14:32:16,Hard disagree. Cossa has incredible numbers right now. Buchelnikov and ASP are going ape shit. Danielson is one of the most underrated prospects in the league imo. Mazur and Lombardi look good. Emmit finnie looks like a late round steal. Wallinder has the tools to be really good. The criticisms of some of the veteran signings is warranted I think but hating on these prospects before they even get to the show is wild. Especially considering yzerman has drafted so well over the years in Tampa. Also how the hell is edvinnson not an impact player as a top pairing D man in the NHL at 21 lmao.
detroitredwings,lxsp9sk,2024-11-18 13:42:07,username checks out
detroitredwings,lxszs0x,2024-11-18 14:34:38,> Pretty sure he was basically trying to get himself fired last seasonI honestly didn't want to believe this but as the losing streak grew and we didn't win a game for almost two months I became convinced the dude was just not trying at all.
detroitredwings,lxtjihe,2024-11-18 16:14:35,The captain is supposed to carry the weight.  I just don't think that Larkin has the right personality for the role. He may thrive more as a player without the responsibility.
detroitredwings,lxsxjxq,2024-11-18 14:23:28,That's the joke man it's from the movie King Pin.
detroitredwings,lxt0zsa,2024-11-18 14:40:48,Can't get nothing by this guy
detroitredwings,lxsx782,2024-11-18 14:21:41,Bro it's not exactly apples to oranges. Chill out.
detroitredwings,lxu5aqx,2024-11-18 18:09:23,Yeah there are a lot of players that only care about the money. Thats why you want a good coach to try and get the ex most out of all your players.
detroitredwings,lxszkdj,2024-11-18 14:33:34,Not really I just think you can't know everything about a person based on if they listen to one band lol
detroitredwings,lxt3pbf,2024-11-18 14:54:30,Parachutes and Rush of Blood still stand up I agree. I kinda stopped following after the rest of the albums but they had some good hits. I don't think there's anything wrong with being a fan I just thought it would be funny to bring Coldplay into this. Ya know the gag from Knocked Up and all...I wonder sometimes if Dylan is still learning how to motivate other men and communicate as a leader. Perhaps sometimes you need a little id a la Metallica  to balance out the finer sensitivities of early 2000's British indie rock...
detroitredwings,lxtm37r,2024-11-18 16:27:32,Scotty would haver never come to the Red Wings if they were rebuilding at the time.  He knew that he had most of the ingredients needed to win big.
detroitredwings,lxt8xha,2024-11-18 15:21:15,Scotty also had a team that had much more talent that Lalonde has today.  Scotty's coaching style was geared towards a skilled team that needed to learn defense.  We don't have half the skilled players the Wings had in his tenure.
detroitredwings,lxstc9u,2024-11-18 14:02:22,Larkin is 3 goals away from first place in league. GTFO with the “Larkin doesn’t do much”. Cat and Raymond are having decent seasons as well.
detroitredwings,lxtozq3,2024-11-18 16:42:17,Agreed but Tarasenko has been a really good 3rd liner for us. He’s really gelled well with Marco and berggie. Perron just has incredible rhythm with the puck completely different player but tarasenko can cover the 200 feet a lot better. It’s tempting to compare I wish we had them both to be honest and yeah vlad has sucked on the 2nd line but he has done really well on the 3rd line. The points will come but our 3rd line has been one of the bright spots this year so I don’t want to throw Vlad under the bus. I think perron just helped so much because we suck at sustaining pressure and perron was so good at board battles
detroitredwings,lxsv3sd,2024-11-18 14:11:13,No one has moved down more in the draft lottery than Detroit. Also missing on that pick really hurts where the team sits at the moment. * Dropped 2 spots in 2017 from 7th to 9th where they took Michael Rasmussen* Dropped 1 spot in 2018 from 5th to 6th where they took Filip Zadina* Dropped 2 spots in 2019 from 4th to 6th [where they took Moritz Seider](https://www.nhl.com/news/moritz-seider-happily-surprised-to-be-no-6-pick-by-red-wings-at-nhl-draft/c-307976566)* Detroit dropped 3 spots in 2020 draft from 1st to 4th where they took Lucas Raymond* Stayed put in 2021 and 2022 where they took Simon Edvinsson and Marco Kasper at 6th and 8th overall respectively
detroitredwings,lxt0xdc,2024-11-18 14:40:28,Wasnt referring to the goalie prospects but you're right they have the potential to be the world beaters I was omitting so my bad there. I think your taking my comment the wrong way I'm not hating on any of our prospects in fact I like our prospects but realistically we are going to need an elite piece or two to really set this team off if they want to win cups. Are we still considering Edvinnson a prospect? To me he is just an NHLer now and a good young player.
detroitredwings,lxspizp,2024-11-18 13:43:24,Yessir
detroitredwings,lxt2imw,2024-11-18 14:48:30,Maybe “trying to get himself fired” is a little harsh but it is true that he didn’t want to coach that year and wanted to be with his wife while she was getting treatment for her illness but Gores made him a Godfather offer.I don’t fault him for taking that money; you’d be stupid not to.  And I understand that he wasn’t all in due to his personal situation but at the same time if you’re taking that kind of money you kinda have to justify it and his heart clearly wasn’t in it.  At the end of the day though it’s really on Gores for hiring him to begin with though I’ll give him credit for owning up to that mistake biting the bullet and cutting ties.
detroitredwings,lxt058v,2024-11-18 14:36:30,Of course not but it's fun to pretend.
detroitredwings,lxsxczz,2024-11-18 14:22:30,OP has a history of wanting Larkin traded lol
detroitredwings,lxtq1p9,2024-11-18 16:47:36,OP is being hyperbolic but he’s not totally wrong. Larkin was dominating and winning more shifts last year AND the year before. I guarantee he would admit that as well. His goals of course mean something but he’s been impatient giving the puck away a lot in his 5 on 5 offense. Of course this is all relative. I’m saying what I’m saying because I rated his play the last couple years higher than most and overall I think larkin is underrated. My criticisms of him are only because I think highly of his game and think he has another level.
detroitredwings,lxsuxwx,2024-11-18 14:10:24,Yeah they all look so great that's why the team sucks. Larkin is -6.  Negative six and he has 10 goals.  That's not a good look.  Either is the fact that he only has 3 assists. Those stats would be better if they were flip-flopped. Raymond on the other hand has 2 goals and 14 assists.  His ass is out there grinding more than I originally thought and he is dishing way more than he is scoring.  So I'll stand corrected on him. Debrincat's stats are pretty balanced.  If you look at all three of them Larkin has the worst numbers.
detroitredwings,lxswdf4,2024-11-18 14:17:33,Facts.  Imagine if things went in the opposite direction.  They'd have a different roster for the better.  Rasmussen ain't shit Zadina ain't shit.  Seider and Raymond are studs. We'll see on Edvinsson and Kasper.
detroitredwings,lxt4zgx,2024-11-18 15:00:56,No I wasn’t taking like you were being super negative. Honestly I really think the Trouba situation screwed us hard this year. Our blue line desperately needed him. I’m not in love with Trouba or anything but if we got him we would actually have a functional NHL blue line. Really I just see people getting down on these prospects before they are even 20-21 years old and that’s wild to me. Not singling you out bud. Some prospects can be really good and develop later too. Like I personally think Johansson is really gonna be solid for us moving forward and it took him a minute.Edit: People on this sub if you defend yzerman call you a meat rider but I mean his drafting record in Tampa speaks for itself and obviously we’re all hoping and praying he pulled another kucherov out of his sleeve with buchelnikov or ASP and another 88 with cossa. 
detroitredwings,lxt2y0h,2024-11-18 14:50:40,Sir this is r/detroitredwings. You're supposed to be pedantic about everything here and take jokes 100% at their face value.
detroitredwings,lxtrrt3,2024-11-18 16:56:19,I’m not closed minded to Larkin criticism. He gets frustrated easily (though I would too) and can be a bit of a puck hog sometimes
detroitredwings,lxswn9p,2024-11-18 14:18:56,I agree. Of course I’d love to see larkin keep scoring but this is the worst 5 on 5 hockey larkin has played in 3 years. He’s giving the puck away cheaply most shifts. And with this team how he goes the rest of them go. Agree also with Raymond. If you recall when wings had the really bad stretch last year Raymond was the only forward consistently playing well. It’s not about points. It’s about winning battles and making plays. I don’t think larkin is playing terrible but he’s not playing up to his standards.
detroitredwings,lxsxw1e,2024-11-18 14:25:09,Those guys are definitely trending the right way. Imagine if it was Yzerman making the 2018 pick instead of Kenny.
detroitredwings,lxtsbhq,2024-11-18 16:59:06,His drafting record in Tampa is kinda irrelevant when he has none of the same staff here in Detroit. It’s not like Draper and Hakan Andersson were making draft boards in TB.
detroitredwings,lxswxk0,2024-11-18 14:20:21,Raymond will get his ass knocked down hobble off the ice and be back for the next shift.  Larkin takes a hard hit and he heads straight for the tunnel.
detroitredwings,lxt0e6w,2024-11-18 14:37:46,Hahaha. Honestly I don’t think it’s a lack of toughness. It’s like more a lack of patience which I think is like a bad contagious thing right now. Even Raymond does it. They get such little possession when they do get it they freak out like deer in headlights instead of patiently setting up the cycle and getting something quality they force so many bad passes to the slot or bad seam passes across the slot. How many of those passes have been intercepted? So many. Also so many bad shots.
detroitredwings,lxs9dfu,2024-11-18 12:22:26,Can't be worse than Gus
detroitredwings,lxsbc7w,2024-11-18 12:32:17,I don’t know this man but he can’t be any worse than who we have right now![gif](giphy|yr7n0u3qzO9nG)
detroitredwings,lxs9kmk,2024-11-18 12:23:26,I'm sure that's the change that'll do it.
detroitredwings,lxsbv9u,2024-11-18 12:34:56,Just hoping he plays well enough to stay up once Ed is back.
detroitredwings,lxsd392,2024-11-18 12:41:01,Of course our recent form will have a lot of people writing this off and obviously so will the fact that Lagesson isn't at all a needle mover. however it's an interesting move to call up somebody from the AHL for the last game of a 4-gm road trip and have them travel all the way to SJS presumably for this game. I'm guessing somebody might be sick or we're worried about Ed's knee. But even still we went on the road trip with an extra defenseman. Otherwise if this is purely a move because of performance I'm very curious to see who is riding pine tonight.
detroitredwings,lxsa2nh,2024-11-18 12:25:55,Nothing to get excited about. This guy isn't a young prospect getting his first shot. He's a journeyman.
detroitredwings,lxsjven,2024-11-18 13:15:01,Maybe he will get 20 shots a game
detroitredwings,lxski9c,2024-11-18 13:18:13,I'm mainly a Leaf fella - I was really bummed when the leafs lost Lagesson on waivers last year. We was solid player who just didn't seem to fit Keefe's plans for whatever reason.
detroitredwings,lxs9887,2024-11-18 12:21:43,When is it gunna say the red wings have fired lalonde
detroitredwings,lxsbmia,2024-11-18 12:33:43,This probably means Edvinsson isn't playing again
detroitredwings,lxsgdgw,2024-11-18 12:57:20,Thank you Stephen
detroitredwings,lxsgl5w,2024-11-18 12:58:23,So…does this mean something about Ed?
detroitredwings,lxsiuw5,2024-11-18 13:09:52,I know this is likely cus Ed is injured and the team is struggling. But I keep refreshing Twitter/X hoping there’s a trade involving one of our sub par D
detroitredwings,lxtfqeh,2024-11-18 15:55:36,Was called up in case Ed couldnt go sounds like Ed is playing tonight.
detroitredwings,lxtglvg,2024-11-18 15:59:59,I'm sure he'll play great after flying to California this afternoon lol.
detroitredwings,lxsmxp7,2024-11-18 13:30:21,Lagesson will actually surprise a lot of people
detroitredwings,lxspsng,2024-11-18 13:44:45,This can't be good news.
detroitredwings,lxt68ug,2024-11-18 15:07:26,Ah yes the missing piece
detroitredwings,lxt71bn,2024-11-18 15:11:30,Ah yes that'll fix things lol
detroitredwings,lxtgmrj,2024-11-18 16:00:06,Makes sense Lagesson and Rafferty are the most point producing and reliable D man for GR.It's a shame Buium isn't really doing much considering he was a higher 2nd round pick.Wallinder has been hurt but was doing much better than he was last year. Definitely seems like some of the Euro players struggle with the NA ice and pace.
detroitredwings,lxsi9s0,2024-11-18 13:06:54,Yzerman has done a terrible job of building this defense. Sadly the one guy who was actually good at his job(Maata) has been traded.
detroitredwings,lxsu3gl,2024-11-18 14:06:11,To coach?
detroitredwings,lxsvsgx,2024-11-18 14:14:38,Time to commit to the tank. Likely means Ed is out long term. Thank god Mo didn’t hold out because if he did Yzerman wouldn’t have any argument to not give him max money and term for what he brings to this team
detroitredwings,lxtbwj8,2024-11-18 15:36:24,William “Lyon?” Lagesson
detroitredwings,lxscvfl,2024-11-18 12:39:56,Really gonna push us over the hump here fellas!
detroitredwings,lxsoawl,2024-11-18 13:37:13,They need to recall Walman back from the SharTs. Like wtf Stevie...lolz
detroitredwings,lxsd2sy,2024-11-18 12:40:57,Remember when people were saying he’d be an upgrade from Ghost? Woof.
detroitredwings,lxs9y08,2024-11-18 12:25:15,My thoughts exactly. I was hoping Ed was gonna be back tonight but this doesn't make that seem to likely..
detroitredwings,lxsb3gk,2024-11-18 12:31:02,https://i.redd.it/vqgcrykp3p1e1.gif
detroitredwings,lxscsn5,2024-11-18 12:39:33,I like how our team sacrifices offense for defense when we don't even have defense. It's a big brain move I tell ya.
detroitredwings,lxsayoo,2024-11-18 12:30:23,I hear you  but you never know. He’s been solid in GRR. And otherwise you are just playing the same guys hoping for better results. At the same time I’m guessing it’s purely Incase someone else gets hurt today or during warmups and don’t expect him to play.
detroitredwings,lxsdhpd,2024-11-18 12:43:00,I'm confused as to what you were expecting. Wallinder would be the only one I'd consider potentially ready and he's hurt. Buium has had a rough start Viro is not ready Dello hasn't been good Rafferty has been good but then you'd complain about a journeyman. Tuomisto has also been good but why send him up to get manhandled on the third pairing. Laggy has 100gp in the NHL he can be a serviceable bottom pairing guy.
detroitredwings,lxs9h85,2024-11-18 12:22:58,Probably not until after the season is over  I’m waiting for “Red Wings pull priority patch off original six sweater”
detroitredwings,lxsagqr,2024-11-18 12:27:54,No soon enough at the rate things are going... Stevie needs to shake some things up here and make some real serious changes if this team is going to compete. Lalonde needs to go and our D core needs a completely rework; anyone who's on the big team now and isn't Seider or Ed gotta go. Maybe Keep Albert for now too since he's green.
detroitredwings,lxs9mxe,2024-11-18 12:23:44,And recalled coach Dan Watson
detroitredwings,lxsic39,2024-11-18 13:07:13,I heard they have to amputate possibly the whole body
detroitredwings,lxsi3by,2024-11-18 13:05:59,You're welcome Calvin.
detroitredwings,lxsifd9,2024-11-18 13:07:41,Still not sure yet. Last I heard they were hopeful that both Ed and Ras will be available tonight. Hopefully we'll find out what the morning skate looked like soon until then I am hoping they are using this move to sit Petry or Gus.
detroitredwings,lxskwqu,2024-11-18 13:20:14,![gif](giphy|l0NwNrl4BtDD7JCx2)
detroitredwings,lxsqztf,2024-11-18 13:50:43,I hope you're right. I honestly don't know enough about him other than the stats on his career page. Like others have said he can't be worse than Gus or Petry..
detroitredwings,lxsqtp4,2024-11-18 13:49:53,The general feeling here is that because it wasn't under emergency conditions it was to sit someone who needs a wakeup call.
detroitredwings,lxsyf5a,2024-11-18 14:27:49,He wasn't called up under emergency conditions so not likely related to Ed or his status at all. This is likely more to do with scratching someone to send a message.
detroitredwings,lxszk6c,2024-11-18 14:33:32,I thought at worst Gus would be an even trade from Ghost. Yes I was wrong but I don't think it was crazy to think that much.
detroitredwings,lxsjvjb,2024-11-18 13:15:02,The upgrade they meant is how his name is slightly easier to pronounce. Downgrade in every other category
detroitredwings,lxswsr9,2024-11-18 14:19:41,Watched the last two games in person. Gus is near invisible on the ice. Maybe he's actually a ghost?Meanwhile Gostisbehere had an all-world turnover in his own end last night resulting in a B-Losers goal but is having a good season.
detroitredwings,lxsdxu4,2024-11-18 12:45:14,I know I wasn't one of them and I am sure I can safely say this might be a common theme amongst Gus supporters...![gif](giphy|YLAAtwEuHgBgv9kyK3)
detroitredwings,lxsxidg,2024-11-18 14:23:15,I miss Ghost.
detroitredwings,lxsdpr4,2024-11-18 12:44:07,Might as well lose 7-6 instead of lose 4-1.
detroitredwings,lxsf1td,2024-11-18 12:50:44,It’s weird but we actually have good 5v5 defense. That may have changed since the Anaheim and LA games but the last league wide 5v5 goals% and expected goals % we were top 10 in the league. It’s our PK that was like bottom 2 or 3 worst. And of course 5v5 offense was bottom 5 too.
detroitredwings,lxsdyrk,2024-11-18 12:45:22,Where the hell did I complain or even say I was expecting anything? I'm a Griffins fan as well as a Wings fan as I live in Grand Rapids. I was stating a fact for anyone who didn't know.
detroitredwings,lxsebmh,2024-11-18 12:47:07,His comment serves to regulate where I'm supposed to be on this... I don't pay attention to GRG at all and I can imagine some upcoming prospects slip my memory.I will pay less attention to this guy tonight.
detroitredwings,lxsh91e,2024-11-18 13:01:43,It really did all start to go down hill the day they came out on the ice with that trash patch didnt it lol
detroitredwings,lxsd1w7,2024-11-18 12:40:49,"I went from ""Stevie all the way"" to ""Get rid of everybody except the kids."""
detroitredwings,lxsdj4v,2024-11-18 12:43:12,I think those guys will go we are just waiting for them to develop in GR. No sense in spending draft capital for assets we could already have. This is going to be a rough transition for fans but we are going to come out on the other side in a good place. Lots of rebuilds take a step back to take two steps forward.
detroitredwings,lxt8xkk,2024-11-18 15:21:16,[They chopped his whole body off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5PoFzHE7-c&t=21s)
detroitredwings,lxshj7e,2024-11-18 13:03:09,Take penalties bad don’t take them good Who would’ve thought. Well as much as our 5v5 has been good with GA if you can’t exit the zone and score 5v5 is it really that good? We absurdly struggle with sustainable zone exit’s maintaining puck control. Is that forwards not getting open defenders missing the mark I guess I don’t watch close enough to give that information but somethings got to give. It’s quite embarrassing to give up 1 5v5 goal being bad defensively then instantly give up another 1 while again being bad defensively
detroitredwings,lxsee2c,2024-11-18 12:47:28,Thanks for letting us know Stevie wasn't hiding Cale Makar 2.0 in GR lol
detroitredwings,lxsjsu2,2024-11-18 13:14:40,It did for a bit and then we fought with our heels hanging off the edge of the cliff until the Flyers gave us the final shove. But in general yes. We’ve sucked ass since the trash patch was put on. And I’m sick of it. Historically a coaching change mid season has worked for a number of teams. We should try it.
detroitredwings,lxt3xaa,2024-11-18 14:55:36,Man I really want to see our record since that happened from the end of last year into this year.
detroitredwings,lxsdlvo,2024-11-18 12:43:34,Honestly I was pissed after he traded Hronek and Bert. I thought well he probably knows better…. Seems like he doesn’t.
detroitredwings,lxsejpc,2024-11-18 12:48:14,Yeah they do take time but with all the time and money put into our current top 2 lines this team can actually compete with a solid defensive core. We honestly can't count on one good defensive pairing to carry this team even though we seem to try to..
detroitredwings,lxsp0o6,2024-11-18 13:40:49,I mean I definitely ain’t saying we’re good just that it’s interesting how on the ice we look so ass defensively but the stats say we’re good. We’re seeing the results that it doesn’t matter how good you are if the pucks in your zone 80% of the game I’m more so just confused how 5v5 D can be good but PK so bad. I too hate the long flips out to the far blue line and also the weak dump ins with 0 forecheck.
detroitredwings,lxso9fa,2024-11-18 13:37:01,Hronek was one of my favorite players during the most recent dark times. I even bought one of his sticks lol
detroitredwings,lxsh462,2024-11-18 13:01:02,Hronek was a good rrade at the time and I'm still pretty happy with how it turned out.I do sort of wish he signed Bert this summer though. I'd rather have him than Tarasenko for similar money.
detroitredwings,lxsg9s2,2024-11-18 12:56:49,Who knows maybe we tried to make swings on good defenders. Maybe we were in on Chychrun. The Maatta trade sends a signal that we are selling off these spare parts to make room for the kids. You can sign way better deals when it's your own prospect. Rasmussen contract for an example.
detroitredwings,lxu8r6u,2024-11-18 18:29:22,   The only forwards that can or will forecheck are in our bottom 6 where we store our borderline AHL talent. Can't expect much production from that. Especially when they're so over concerned about playing defensive hockey.
detroitredwings,lxspfg1,2024-11-18 13:42:54,1 less skater so more space for the opposing team to utilize said space is the only reason I can think of. I guess ill watch closer tonight and if I remember share my thoughts of our 5v5 defense vs our PK statistics

detroitredwings,lxshn7y,2024-11-18 13:03:43,Hronek is just a top pairing defenseman who compliments Seider but a draft pick could be anything even a top pairing defensemen who would compliment Seider just four years before we could possible see that if he pans out maybe.

detroitredwings,lxsk5cv,2024-11-18 13:16:24,I think my biggest gripe with Yzerman(and hockey as a whole but Yzerman is an extreme here) is the older I get the more I find the whole “run the org like the CIA and be incredibly secretive” thing incredibly stupid. I’m not sure I think the advantages are real and it’s like somewhere along the way hockey forgot it’s in the entertainment business. Other sports don’t do this nearly as much. At the end of the day we’re watching grown men play a game lol it’s really not that seriousDavid Poile and now Barry Trotz deserve a lot of praise and credit for taking the time to do fairly candid weekly radio hits.

The underlyings still look good (is that Quinn or Filip though?) but that’s one heck of a price tag he’s signed to. I’m very pleased that we turned him into ASP and that we ourselves aren’t paying that.

But what exactly would a new coach do that he’s not? I’m not opposed I just truly do not know how a new coach will improve our performance. What will someone else do better? 
detroitredwings,lxua3fd,2024-11-18 18:37:10,Ryan Hana: Look with your eyes look with analytics look with both.  Detroit without Ed or Mo is suck.True truths friends 
detroitredwings,lxqvhqe,2024-11-18 07:27:40,Maybe it’s time to cash in that future consideration and get Jake Walman back.
detroitredwings,lxroogk,2024-11-18 10:35:09,Must-lose game
detroitredwings,lxrsso3,2024-11-18 10:57:08,Maybe this is the game that gets Lalonde fired.
detroitredwings,lxrif26,2024-11-18 10:00:07,I just hope they don’t blow it…again…versus a bottom feeder team….like they did against Anaheim…
detroitredwings,lxre9n0,2024-11-18 09:35:39,okay but like who replaces newsy realistically
detroitredwings,lxs9k1p,2024-11-18 12:23:21,I firmly believe this is newsy's swan song if the wings lose tonight 
detroitredwings,lxspyb2,2024-11-18 13:45:32,Realistically if we lose tonight how long do we think Lalonde has? If SY lets him go do we get an interim coach or do they actually hire someone new (and who)
detroitredwings,lxth7s8,2024-11-18 16:03:03,I honestly hope Walman Griddys on us I don’t even care anymore. I’m gonna watch the whole stupid game though and hope that it doesn’t suck (it will).
detroitredwings,lxrgivr,2024-11-18 09:49:09,I hope SJ Scores 10 on Detroit tonight and Walman does the gritty against Detroit. I want to see this team pissed off. These moral victories are stale at this point 
detroitredwings,lxu8h4x,2024-11-18 18:27:46,Red Wings continue to average the fewest shots and allow the most shots. That being said.. they are overachieving.
detroitredwings,lxsf234,2024-11-18 12:50:46,I hope we get griddy'd by Walman tonight and lose big enough to fire Lalonde
detroitredwings,lxrhj50,2024-11-18 09:55:01,I want us to win cuz I'm a Wings fan but what happens if we lose?I don't think Newsy gets fired. If the bottling last year and poor play for most of this year hasn't gotten him fired I don't think this one game will either.
detroitredwings,lxrhjby,2024-11-18 09:55:03,Have you all ever seen the Final Fantasy XIV end of 1.0/launch of 2.0 cinematic? Basically there is a giant super powered primal called Bahamut  (who was imprisoned in the moon) which has been harnessed by the Garlean Empire to wipe out the Lominsan Gridanian and Ul'dahn forces. The Garleans don't know they have been played by their own emperor who is actually an evil time traveler spirit guy trying to destroy the world and Bahamut is about to do so but fortunately this old guy and his friends plus the player are able to use their willpower and determination to give the old guy more magic powers to bind Bahamut into a perma-prison in the planet. It kills the old guy but the evil people lose and the good guys win.  Have we tried that yet? What if we all spend the whole game praying to the spirit of Gordie Howe or something? Maybe they win?
detroitredwings,lxserj4,2024-11-18 12:49:19,I've done lots of defending over the weekend of this franchise. But I'll be ready to put on the clown costume if we lose tonight.
detroitredwings,lxswkby,2024-11-18 14:18:31,Don’t understand the root against your own team stuff. This is that transition year where we see more youth and there were going to be some growing pains. Still possible to work through it and make the playoffs. Even if we come up short I fully expect to be better next year as we continue to add Kasper Berggren Johansson Cossa Mazur Danielson etc. and an extreme outside chance at ASP. Future still looks promising.

Last year we were lucky shooting the puck this year we’re not. We also have had a few key worse individual performances(Compher and the 2nd pair losing Sprong and Ghost). We dump it in less this year while other teams increased their dump rates. Yet this is the year where everyone is obsessed with “Lalondes system”

It is really scary and hard to watch like all substance use disorders.  Best wishes to everyone quitting or reducing intake.  Seeking help is the brave choice.

detroitredwings,lxsdhce,2024-11-18 12:42:57,Even if Ed is injured I don't think we can technically use an emergency call up since we have six healthy defensemen. I'm very intrigued to see who is out of the lineup tonight

detroitredwings,lxrb3u4,2024-11-18 09:16:12,Idk would the Red Wings have made the playoffs last season with Hronek anchoring the 2nd pairing instead of Petry? Probably. But we’ll still have to wait and see with ASP before judging the trade.

detroitredwings,lxrdrp8,2024-11-18 09:32:36,Losing Hronek was bad but signing him at that price and term would have been worse. It was a lose-lose situation and the Wings made the choice that minimized the damage.
detroitredwings,lxranw9,2024-11-18 09:13:27,When ASP turns into a half a point per game defenseman in the NHL we can say it’s a good trade. Until then the jury is still out imo.
detroitredwings,lxser1c,2024-11-18 12:49:14,I remember reading his career path after we acquired him. Definitely a bit of a head scratcher as it looks like he was barely able to hold a roster spot on previous teams played for league minimums and went through PTOs. Then we just go ahead and give him $2MM per year. Good for him! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Gustafsson_(ice_hockey_born_1992)
detroitredwings,lxsem2a,2024-11-18 12:48:34,Yeah I wanted to wait a little while before shitting on him but he’s a level of bad we haven’t seen since Hagg
detroitredwings,lxsbzjx,2024-11-18 12:35:31,I think they took a shot because he played well on the Pp with Kane in the past but agree it’s not working. Doubt they move him but Sprong got dealt 9 games into his career with Canucks.
detroitredwings,lxsfn3l,2024-11-18 12:53:41,There's a few guys we'd have been better off not signing... The silver lining is it's a relatively short and cheap deal though I suppose.

detroitredwings,lxthvhs,2024-11-18 16:06:24,Husso seems to be in a weird spot where he looks almost too good for the AHL but can’t seem to play the same when he gets called up. Should be interesting to see what they do when Campbell is back.

detroitredwings,lxtjba2,2024-11-18 16:13:35,I'd honestly like to see him over some of our other defensemen to see if it looks even remotely better. I certainly don't expect anything special from the guy but I think he could hold down a bottom pair.

If you have two coaches that fail under your watch then you're probably next on the chopping block.  This is why I'm sure Yzerman for his own purely selfish reasons might also be hesitant to fire Lalonde too quickly.

detroitredwings,lxs2uu8,2024-11-18 11:49:23,This exact situation weirdly enough has come up twice in my life both times I said I had no idea in a positive way. One time I was lying… May the odds be in your favor
detroitredwings,lxs5ibf,2024-11-18 12:02:51,I do mine too. People can probably tell but my partner doesn't care and who else I gotta look good for?
detroitredwings,lxtcre6,2024-11-18 15:40:46,"1) ""I had no idea you cut your own hair"" is neither positive nor negative. Could be code for ""looks like shit""2) They'll never tell you how bad it looks.3) I think it looks nice"
detroitredwings,lxtgpxs,2024-11-18 16:00:33,I haven't but if anyone can do it right it would be Vintage Detroit.I would definitely reach out and make sure they have the right materials though first.
detroitredwings,lxu8u8j,2024-11-18 18:29:51,At that point just keep Lalonde and go tanking lol. Find a better coach than what's available now in the offseason.
detroitredwings,lxqz2k8,2024-11-18 07:55:20,Yet again it is entirely possible. He’s Yzermans guy and Yzerman has shown he doesn’t make big moves in the middle of the season like this usually
detroitredwings,lxqxx5w,2024-11-18 07:46:44,Lol yeah sure Yzerman would totallllly do that
detroitredwings,lxrcjqh,2024-11-18 09:25:09,They sold last spring and played their prospects and ended up better for it.  At the same time the caps have some great vets. I remember thinking last spring when we were fighting with them over that last playoff spot that they seemed hungrier faster and tougher than the wings. 
detroitredwings,lxryyyj,2024-11-18 11:29:36,To get a top 5 pick we’d have to suffer a whole lot more yet… only 17 games in
detroitredwings,lxs5res,2024-11-18 12:04:08,Any of Schaefer Martone Misa or Hagens would be nice
detroitredwings,lxt06o1,2024-11-18 14:36:43,Eklund
detroitredwings,lxs9fd5,2024-11-18 12:22:42,That's the boat I'm in.
detroitredwings,lxr3uky,2024-11-18 08:29:08,I doubt they fire Lalonde if they lose to San Jose
detroitredwings,lxtm195,2024-11-18 16:27:16,If you're at emo that's ok you only need to worry when you hit goth. Then you just smoke a parliament and dance in the corner I'll be waiting for you there.
detroitredwings,lxttnn8,2024-11-18 17:06:03,You’re giving entirely too much weight to strangers shouting over each other in the void that is the internet. 
detroitredwings,lxs8sp9,2024-11-18 12:19:32,Interviewing with us? Source?
detroitredwings,lxslgdv,2024-11-18 13:22:57,I held out for a while but yeah this is badLet's get Murph in there or something. Or just let Tanguay take over the power play is going pretty goodThough if it's Murph that means no more getting yammed on dollar hot dog night
detroitredwings,lxt9q4h,2024-11-18 15:25:20,"Stevie talks about a ""Winning Culture"". You're never going to get that from Lalonde. The guy couldn't fire up the team if he backed them into a blowtorch. Sometimes you can just look at someone and say ""He's not inspiring me"". Now go look at a one of Newsy's post game pressers... you can say it... he's not inspiring me."
detroitredwings,lxrgwvj,2024-11-18 09:51:25,"I'm going to exaggerate just a bit here.I hope Lalonde gets fired and replaced with McLellan who does mediocre this season and is even worse next season just to see what the ""literally replace Newsy with anybody and don't even think about it"" crowd says then."
detroitredwings,lxrigrr,2024-11-18 10:00:23,Even if they win it's still a disaster season and roster
detroitredwings,lxshhmc,2024-11-18 13:02:55,The only way to guarantee you get one is just get there as early as possible. There will probably be people lining up outside the doors before they open. It really just varies based on weekday promo weather etc.
detroitredwings,lxsmn3i,2024-11-18 13:28:52,Walk up the steps in garage and take bridge across to arena.I cant remember what bobblehead it was (March 16th against Buffalo last year) but bridge entrance were passing them out left and right minutes before puck drop and there were loads of people that entered through normal entrances that were all out 
detroitredwings,lxsk3tz,2024-11-18 13:16:11,Try going into one of those restaurants and get a drink or some food and see if you can get in faster that way. Otherwise idk it's just about timing. Maybe try to contact some season ticket holders you are friends with or see if you can do a trade.
detroitredwings,lxu8n4g,2024-11-18 18:28:44,Sometimes it's not doing better just having a different voice.Look at Edmonton last year. They were miserably bad to start the season and ended up in the finals.For whatever reason new coaches shake up the dynamic and usually there is a positive bump in play. It might not last forever but it does usually help.Vancouver did far better with Boudreau than the previous coach but it didn't last forever. Then they did better with Toccet and that's kinda sliding too.A good percentage of hockey is mental and changes coaches can help players change their mindset and get out of their funk
detroitredwings,lxuaej9,2024-11-18 18:38:58,I'm not going to pretend they haven't been our best pair but they're talking like we don't suck with them. We're still playing like one of the worst teams in the league even if they're on the ice.
detroitredwings,lxrilbj,2024-11-18 10:01:07,I do and then we might fire gru
detroitredwings,lxrfylz,2024-11-18 09:45:48,Realistically it’s either gonna be one of the assistants to be the interim or one of the high profile candidates outside the org like McLellan Woodcroft or even Q.Either way I personally don’t really care who it ends up being.
detroitredwings,lxrgdke,2024-11-18 09:48:16,I don't care
detroitredwings,lxrfdif,2024-11-18 09:42:20,Literally anyone with a pulse. No but realistically I don’t care who it is this team just needs some energy behind the bench. It’s like a morgue back there.
detroitredwings,lxrf5fd,2024-11-18 09:40:59,Literally anyone but Q. I know this isn't an airport no need to announce my departure or whatever but I don't think I could keep watching if they hire him.
detroitredwings,lxrs2iu,2024-11-18 10:53:17,Gimme Boudreau. Feels like he’s been around the block enough times to understand he’d be an interim/placeholder and he’s not afraid to coach offense-first hockey.
detroitredwings,lxsf0h7,2024-11-18 12:50:33,Would love that but i doubt it.
detroitredwings,lxsdyok,2024-11-18 12:45:21,I will be honest here. Unless Wings are winning tonight in a dominant fashion and not just squeeze out a 50-50 game with a W I rather them lose bad and see Newsy get canned. I want him gone either way
detroitredwings,lxsvk0n,2024-11-18 14:13:28,My thoughts mostly out of my ass since we have so little info:If we lay another stinker and Lalonde isn’t fired before next game then you can be pretty sure he’s here the majority of the season. Just makes sense right now if he is going to do itIf we go interim coach that likely means we’re going with someone who isn’t one of the 5-10 old fucks sitting around without a job right now. Everyone else is usually with a team and it’s rare to leave mid seasonI just have a feeling if we fire mid season it will be Quenneville. Idk why just a feeling. Ever since the reports that we were in on Mitchell Miller i have 0 illusion Steve cares about stuff like that and from a hockey view I certainly see the logic. God forbid someone dance on the ice though obviously we don’t know if Walmans griddying played into the trade but I’d be kidding myself if I said I don’t believe it didAnyone putting a % chance or anything on this is full of it we truly have basically no info. And again almost everything above is out of my ass
detroitredwings,lxssex2,2024-11-18 13:57:43,Honestly I don't think he goes until end of season. SY has preached nothing but patience. As for who we'd even get no idea. Lane Lambert was a front runner for the job before NYI snapped him up. Woodcroft is available but couldn't get Edmonton going with McDavid and Draisaitl.McClellan Gallant Quennville are all names that have been thrown around as well I personally don't like any of those choices.
detroitredwings,lxsqg1c,2024-11-18 13:48:00,I think the quickest Newsy gets let go is…Yzerman isn’t impulsive….carry the one…pc load letter….new years…I think he’s got another monthNot sure Yzerman can risk firing him any later if it’s a playoff or bust year.
detroitredwings,lxu8rjw,2024-11-18 18:29:26,Lalonde has mentioned multiple times that its a strategy to get bailed out by goaltending so
detroitredwings,lxrq5lr,2024-11-18 10:43:07,0 points on the west coast trip that should easily be expected to get at least 4 should cost someone something
detroitredwings,lxrk12e,2024-11-18 10:09:21,Well the last three sucked so
detroitredwings,lxrirzs,2024-11-18 10:02:11,I think we used all of our power of friendship deus ex machina in the last 2 against Montreal last season
detroitredwings,lxsagtf,2024-11-18 12:27:54,I was so certain this was going to transition to an Undertaker Hell in a Cell meme
detroitredwings,lxsz4if,2024-11-18 14:31:21,This argument is so fucking lazy. We’re not playing bad cause of rookies like Edvinsson Johannson berggren Kasper. We are having a bad season cause of dead weight like chiarot Copp Petry Rasmussen etc
detroitredwings,lxt6qs9,2024-11-18 15:09:59,"The growing pains are coming from the ""vets"" who aren't pulling their weight on this team. You sort of expect these high-priced vets to be leaders. We saw how they"" lead"" the minute Larkin gets hurt and is out of the lineup. They shriveled up like prunes last year... or to be more graphic like George Costanza's willie after an ocean swim (shrinkage!). Lots of big money got handed out and we aren't seeing shit from some of these UFAs. We aren't getting any veteran presence for our dollars."
detroitredwings,lxt21zj,2024-11-18 14:46:10,Nothing really elite there. Aside from maybe Cossa these are depth pieces. Desperately need some high end talent. IMO this is the last chance to try and get a top 3 pick
detroitredwings,lxt5bp9,2024-11-18 15:02:41,"Is there a difference between ""Dump and Chase"" and ""Dump and Skate to the Bench""? Asking for a friend. Unless I'm missing something with my eyes the whole dumping it in and then losing possession doesn't seem to be working out so well for us. We use Dump and Chase as a way to get everyone off the ice like a Chinese fire drill. The whole ""chase"" part of that is missing in the Newsy system."
detroitredwings,lxt5q7i,2024-11-18 15:04:45,Man you gotta read the room before you come in here with rationality lol. According to this sub it’s a black and white issue. We fire Newsy and the team goes on to win the cup lol.
detroitredwings,lxt729c,2024-11-18 15:11:38,"Doesn't say much. Going from 54% dump-in to 53% dump-in would put is in the list of ""lower dump in rates"" but is effectively the same. Also does chipping it up the boards into the neutral zone count as dumping it in? Because we do that an awful lot"
detroitredwings,lxt8pce,2024-11-18 15:20:08,Always wondering about stats like this though like in the bigger picture could our less dump-ins stat be related to us having less chances to dump it in?
detroitredwings,lxt2vpd,2024-11-18 14:50:21,The process was also bad last year but the shooting heater that you mentioned just papered over it.
detroitredwings,lxt3nqh,2024-11-18 14:54:17,"I don't mind the dump ins all that much. But what isn't referenced here are the number of times we hear Ken say ""and \[player\] is stationary as they dump it in"" and it's just an immediate turnover. Dump and chase is one thing. Dump and stand there is the system."
detroitredwings,lxt0v0g,2024-11-18 14:40:08,Ah so it's the entire 23 man professional hockey player roster that's not getting it than damn who woulda thought Newsy was too big brain for his time.
detroitredwings,lxt3azw,2024-11-18 14:52:29,Lol okYea Lalonde is a genius.Thanks for the laugh.
detroitredwings,lxse8mv,2024-11-18 12:46:43,We've been saying that for years
detroitredwings,lxrcx3s,2024-11-18 09:27:26,I mean I agree. Lalonde has to go. As for yzerman idk as of right now.
detroitredwings,lxrbdvi,2024-11-18 09:17:56,Wild that 2024 is 9 years after 2019. Time really flies.
detroitredwings,lxrbxde,2024-11-18 09:21:17,Cry about it.
detroitredwings,lxrvryf,2024-11-18 11:12:57,"Mike ""show me your cock"" Babcock!"
detroitredwings,lxrumxo,2024-11-18 11:06:55,I'd rather fold the team than have Babcock coaching it.
detroitredwings,lxrsw12,2024-11-18 10:57:38,we need someone young. Perhaps the second youngest head coach at the time. Someone with no hair. Someone with a simple first name like Jeff.
detroitredwings,lxrr83x,2024-11-18 10:48:48,Source or just wishful thinking...
detroitredwings,lxs22mb,2024-11-18 11:45:25,I prefer winning 1000x more than losing but I mostly enjoy just seeing my team out there. Repping the Winged Wheel listening to Ken and Mick watching all the little story lines develop catching all the off ice antics etc. It's like watching your favorite show every week. Even if the bad guy wins at the end of the episode you still get comfort in watching it because it's your little momentary break from the real world.
detroitredwings,lxs7it7,2024-11-18 12:13:07,All they said was they love the Red Wings lol how is that smoking something? Isn’t that the point of being here?
detroitredwings,lxrmd4t,2024-11-18 10:22:30,Just because we beat a team we should be doesn’t change anything. I’m very sure Yzerman sees that even if we win games. There’s no way he’s comfortable watching this team.
detroitredwings,lxskaay,2024-11-18 13:17:05,honestly I'd respect it
detroitredwings,lxs3jbl,2024-11-18 11:52:49,There is a 0% chance I'm upset with that outcome if Walman is mic'd up for the game
detroitredwings,lxsawvx,2024-11-18 12:30:08,God that would be hilarious
detroitredwings,lxsw6el,2024-11-18 14:16:34,What if we just all send Paul Maurice fifty bucks and a case of Vernors? He coached the Junior Wings.
detroitredwings,lxrw2mv,2024-11-18 11:14:29,I have an early and busy morning tomorrow it's just not worth staying up to watch them give up and dump the puck for 3 periods after they're losing to 10 shots its even more annoying that Steve's there and just hangs out on his phone showing no emotion.
detroitredwings,lxsbohv,2024-11-18 12:33:59,Thanks my friend
detroitredwings,lxsphhi,2024-11-18 13:43:11,The NHL: Best I can do is 24/7 gambling ads with NHL players
detroitredwings,lxssaws,2024-11-18 13:57:10,I don’t blame the NHL too much for the single platform thing or the cost. NHL is set up basically the same way as the MLB and NBA in terms of distribution. And the cost unfortunately I think is a just a reality of the sport and the NHL does have various initiatives to try and combat thatYou bring up a great point on the adversion to CapFriendly and PuckPedia. I wonder how much of that is the NHLPA. I think the next gen stats(or whatever they call it) site they set up is really cool except it has the fatal flaw that if a player is under 50% in something you can’t see where they are at. It just says under 50%. I have to imagine that came from the NHLPAI don’t understand how players(who then go on to be execs) can be so tough and yet so weak mentally. I really don’t think 3 quarters of the league would survive a month in one of the major European soccer leagues
detroitredwings,lxskpiz,2024-11-18 13:19:14,Im alright barely knew the guy. But thank you
detroitredwings,lxsqai2,2024-11-18 13:47:15,I'm sure there's more to the story than he was just having a couple beers every (other) night.  Sounds like a severe alcoholic consumption problem mixed in possibly with an underlying health condition.
detroitredwings,lxtvali,2024-11-18 17:14:43,I ain't booing I just .... I'm sad man
detroitredwings,lxtylsy,2024-11-18 17:32:29,The boos are directed towards the situation at large we find ourselves in.Boo!  Perfidious hockey fate!  Boooo!
detroitredwings,lxsbv2l,2024-11-18 12:34:54,Thank you!
detroitredwings,lxsbptg,2024-11-18 12:34:10,Thank you!
detroitredwings,lxsbubm,2024-11-18 12:34:48,Thank you so much! I still do too. It's a must read. Appreciate the kind words :)
detroitredwings,lxrsgjk,2024-11-18 10:55:22,When did this happen?
detroitredwings,lxsei2t,2024-11-18 12:48:01,There wasn't enough room in the hug circle for Kane Walman and Kane's ego
detroitredwings,lxss83j,2024-11-18 13:56:47,Larkin did something similar after he assisted to Jake for the game winner against MTL. Didn’t skate over to him and stayed by the bench. Clip is below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCYgbNJJIbw&pp=ygUUSmFrZSB3YWxtYW4gbW9udHJlYWw%3D
detroitredwings,lxrqw3w,2024-11-18 10:47:02,Walman “forgot his wallet” at Texas Roadhouse one too many times
detroitredwings,lxsagkp,2024-11-18 12:27:52,Agree with this. Petry is bad. Gustafsson has looked *unusable*.
detroitredwings,lxs9ed5,2024-11-18 12:22:33,Would be fine with that
detroitredwings,lxs9cyl,2024-11-18 12:22:22,No he was not rostered
detroitredwings,lxtdnhx,2024-11-18 15:45:13,That’s interesting. It would seem like getting a rookie goalie a start vs an offensive struggling team that gets maybe 20-30 shots a game would be a good move. But could also really backfire if our offense decided to put on a show.
detroitredwings,lxrzyns,2024-11-18 11:34:44,That OT loss where we led 5-1 in the 2nd or something still haunts me
detroitredwings,lxu3rsl,2024-11-18 18:00:40,Yes - that was me!  And running the call definitely set my voice back.  I am on the mend.  Feeling better now but not 1AM hockey better! 
detroitredwings,lxspqzd,2024-11-18 13:44:31, * Yzerman: You see what we're actually trying to do here is we're trying to get a feel for how people spend their day at work... so if you would would you walk us through a typical day for you? * Lalonde: Yeah. * Yzerman: Great. * Lalonde: Well I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late ah I use the side door - that way Larkin can't see me heh heh - and uh after that I just sorta space out for about an hour. * Yzerman: Da-uh? Space out? * Lalonde: Yeah I just stare at my desk; but it looks like I'm working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch too. I'd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real actual work.
detroitredwings,lxt90gm,2024-11-18 15:21:40,Totally hilarious and hitting it 100%. Love it. Post of the day.
detroitredwings,lxu0du4,2024-11-18 17:42:01,It’s a highly entertaining film

detroitredwings,lxu837z,2024-11-18 18:25:31,Heard he’s in from the gameday presser - so here’s to hoping that sticks!
detroitredwings,lxrbrdi,2024-11-18 09:20:15,I think the contract plays in here too. Hronek would be our third best defenseman at worst right now but I’d be uncomfortable with that on the books.
detroitredwings,lxswjf8,2024-11-18 14:18:23,Huh for some reason I thought he was older than that.
detroitredwings,lxsexzs,2024-11-18 12:50:12,Years ago. Whit Prime Kane. Whit Prime Toews. If this was The reason behind it then reasoning is god awful.
detroitredwings,lxshzbh,2024-11-18 13:05:25,The annoying part is that almost all these bad contracts were pretty predictable as far as them underperforming but Yzerman went ahead and signed them anyway.
detroitredwings,lxrmudt,2024-11-18 10:25:07,Yeah this draft isn't worth getting excited for unless your top 4 or 5.
detroitredwings,lxrqt6h,2024-11-18 10:46:36,Yeah that's what I'm hearing too. 2026 is shaping up to be quite a bit better with Gavin McKenna.
detroitredwings,lxriqt3,2024-11-18 10:02:00,Still…one generational talent and suddenly
detroitredwings,lxrinjd,2024-11-18 10:01:28,I agree he should be accountable for the roster and the fact that they’re losing games. When they win it’s not even like it’s his system is the reason
detroitredwings,lxriww7,2024-11-18 10:02:59,Hard to get excited when we've been screwed so many times. It's like it's meant be that we pick below 5th
detroitredwings,lxrww7q,2024-11-18 11:18:49,There are a few that are showing potential. If Mazur and Lombardi keep progressing they'll make the NHL too.
detroitredwings,lxu8zf2,2024-11-18 18:30:40,Sure thing. It's supposed to be clear so they should make an appearance.
detroitredwings,lxsajal,2024-11-18 12:28:15,I'd say that's on whoever runs the league to move you guys up a division. If I'm paying $500+ to play 1-2 dozen hockey games I'm not about to stop trying because the team I'm playing against sucks.
detroitredwings,lxtvmrx,2024-11-18 17:16:31,Showing blackwood confirmed on Yahoo if Askarovs in I hope our PP1 absolutely shells him
detroitredwings,lxtzepd,2024-11-18 17:36:49,This is the way...unfortunately
detroitredwings,lxr3p0c,2024-11-18 08:28:03,Definitely not. I honestly think losing the next 10 games wouldn’t be enough. Stop hoping for something that’s never gonna happen

detroitredwings,lxrf3fe,2024-11-18 09:40:38,I wonder when that happened. I don’t recall hearing anyone say.

detroitredwings,lxrzqz6,2024-11-18 11:33:39,Well hey if they manage that they'll have done a lot of the right things
detroitredwings,lxs3c9a,2024-11-18 11:51:49,“Credit to the other group; they capitalized on their chances and didn’t let up.  They’re incredibly special and have a bright future ahead of them.”
detroitredwings,lxtevux,2024-11-18 15:51:22,Yzerman keeps the media quiet though. not sure I actually believe he'll fire him though.
detroitredwings,lxs3xd1,2024-11-18 11:54:47,lol. I'm gonna assume I do alright since I don't think one of the people that told me this would have any hesitation in telling me I look like shit. :PSiblings amirite?
detroitredwings,lxsaksk,2024-11-18 12:28:27,Hell yeah friend.
detroitredwings,lxtmbf9,2024-11-18 16:28:41,Yeah that’s a better way of phrasing my question. Was wondering if the materials they used for the numbers were the same
detroitredwings,lxu98kr,2024-11-18 18:32:09,Touché. They desperately need another high pick as well. I’d be okay with either one. We all should know by now that Lalonde is not the answer at this point.
detroitredwings,lxs5zuy,2024-11-18 12:05:20,Honestly it wouldn't feel any different to me. The only game I enjoyed watching this season was the one they played well against the rangers and got shut out. I haven't even enjoyed their wins because they've been so pathetic somehow
detroitredwings,lxs2auk,2024-11-18 11:46:35,People would lose their fucking minds.
detroitredwings,lxsnpb9,2024-11-18 13:34:11,Might as well tank now. What's the point of finishing in the middle and pick 15th. They already have enough bottom 6 players
detroitredwings,lxsh6za,2024-11-18 13:01:26,Didn't you get the email :o
detroitredwings,lxssxp1,2024-11-18 14:00:18,Or maybe it means Murph behind the bench with a hot dog sticking out of his breast pocket so he can sneak bites
detroitredwings,lxt1toy,2024-11-18 14:45:00,yeah I feel like i'm usually on the same page as you. just someone else to try to get a spark. and i'd love to see murph smashing hotdogs during the game while coaching.
detroitredwings,lxrhbgw,2024-11-18 09:53:48,Anyone would be an upgrade over Lalonde at this point. If it weren't for goaltending this team would have like maybe 2 wins on the season...
detroitredwings,lxrikw0,2024-11-18 10:01:02,It's not the coach the team just isn't good
detroitredwings,lxsn3z9,2024-11-18 13:31:13,Isn't that for suites only or am I mistaking that for another similar entrance?
detroitredwings,lxrjxt7,2024-11-18 10:08:50,I concur let gru have the moon in fact fire him right to it!
detroitredwings,lxrgbaz,2024-11-18 09:47:53,Whoever you're replacing Lalonde with you should at the very least expect them to finish out the next season. If you're bringing someone in an outside coach I do want Yzerman to actually think about it.
detroitredwings,lxrjug9,2024-11-18 10:08:18,same.
detroitredwings,lxsz9we,2024-11-18 14:32:06,I've never heard that we were in on Mitchell Miller. That would be incredibly disappointing. Source?
detroitredwings,lxsyzdj,2024-11-18 14:30:37,>Not sure Yzerman can risk firing him any later if it’s a playoff or bust year.Yzerman himself has said this year isn't playoffs or bust. I'd imagine Lalonde is here for the remainder of  the season barring some ridiculous event that necessitates a quicker ousting
detroitredwings,lxszgjg,2024-11-18 14:33:01,Yzerman will not fire Lalonde with time on his contract. Illitch won't pay until the end of the contract.  See Javier Baez.
detroitredwings,lxt8631,2024-11-18 15:17:22,"Stevie's patience is killing me. I would have fired Lalonde last year when he said ""we shouldn't be here"". In context out of context I don't giva fuck. He said it and I'm still pissed about it. The hairless Uncle Fester seems to never stick up for his team. The meek motherfucker always sounds like the voice of reason. Well fuck that lameness. There's a time to be diplomatic and a time to be fiery... I haven't seen fiery yet from Lalonde. His demeanor screams wimp to me."
detroitredwings,lxt0s93,2024-11-18 14:39:44,I mean 95% of the arguments on Reddit are lazy.
detroitredwings,lxtabow,2024-11-18 15:28:22,"Not to mention Kasper and Berggren are already up.  These are all (mostly) depth pieces that will hopefully be a slight upgrade or more of the outgoing veteran ""stopgaps"" Yzerman signed."
detroitredwings,lxth5yt,2024-11-18 16:02:47,I don't know the underlying data but a dump with no intent to pursue (e.g. a line change) is typically not considered part of data for a zone entry analysis.
detroitredwings,lxtz7g9,2024-11-18 17:35:43,That’s not even a strategy - i think that’s just a symptom of getting hemmed in their own zone for a 5 minute major’s worth of time. We’re talking anout it so much now bc it’s (sadly) getting worse
detroitredwings,lxt5xqn,2024-11-18 15:05:51,No I’m saying it’s dumb to only just now become obsessed with his system The dumping has worked extremely well defensively where we punch above our weight. Whether that is worth it with the offensive trade off idk
detroitredwings,lxtcddc,2024-11-18 15:38:47,lol yeah and for me it’s more that blanket saying “system” is like nails on a chalkboard. If someone wants to judge solely off results that is fine it’s kind of the name of the game in sports. But pretending to be about something else is just dumb
detroitredwings,lxt7eks,2024-11-18 15:13:24,The reduction wasn’t even really my point. It was more we’ve been playing the same way for a long while
detroitredwings,lxtahs3,2024-11-18 15:29:14,No… it’s a percentage It could mean you’re forced to dump less aka able to carry the puck in more. But I think that’s unlikely. Honestly the reduction is likely just noise. My point was that with the way people talk you would think it had gone up
detroitredwings,lxt3ci2,2024-11-18 14:52:41,Idk I hear from here that team was really good and 1 point away from the playoffs and had 100 point aspirations coming into this season
detroitredwings,lxt5juj,2024-11-18 15:03:51,We do have a very passive forecheck which is frustrating. However we also have one of the slowest forward groups in the league. Keeping guys high makes sense in that way
detroitredwings,lxt2s09,2024-11-18 14:49:49,Not getting what? And how is he “too big brain”? This honestly reads like you wrote it drunk
detroitredwings,lxt4gs9,2024-11-18 14:58:21,What? I’m saying it’s dumb to be obsessed with it this season and not last(or the year before) lol
detroitredwings,lxrft09,2024-11-18 09:44:54,They love this dude so much when it's so obvious his playstyle is stifling and damaging our players in long run but I'm the stupid one for wanting change ok .
detroitredwings,lxrc9vi,2024-11-18 09:23:27,*6 yrs but still point stands he is too worried about keeping only his close buddies and look where that is going
detroitredwings,lxrvbka,2024-11-18 11:10:32,They just need to stop with the rookie head coach with zero NHL experience.
detroitredwings,lxrrfpb,2024-11-18 10:49:55,I wish I had credible sources... At this point I would take mickey Redmond behind the bench.

detroitredwings,lxrtarw,2024-11-18 10:59:49,Man I do not remember. It was a huge goal.
detroitredwings,lxsf2nk,2024-11-18 12:50:51,Yeah honestly Kane doesn't seem ummmmm likeable. Hahahahaha. Now go score some goals old man!

detroitredwings,lxrc4y8,2024-11-18 09:22:35,I’ll take Hroneks cap hit with his output over the combined cap hit of Copp Compher Petry and Holl though. I think his age plays a bigger part than a million dollar overpayment. He’s literally Larkins age if he wasn’t part of the future it should’ve signaled to everyone Larkin won’t be here to lift a cup
detroitredwings,lxtv9td,2024-11-18 17:14:37,What did he get like $7 million from the Canucks?  For a 40-50 point defender that's steep today but it'll be pretty fair in a couple of years if the cap keeps going up.  If it came down to spending that money on Hronek or Chiarot and Gus I'd probably take Hronek.
detroitredwings,lxrydj8,2024-11-18 11:26:32,Finnie can be put on that list too
detroitredwings,lxsgi9d,2024-11-18 12:57:59,I asked our team captain why we aren't in the A league he seems to think we'd get smoked every game.

detroitredwings,lxsq0gr,2024-11-18 13:45:50,I think it leads to the suites but anyone can get in through that entrance. I remember going that way last year and the suites were through an extra security checkpoint
detroitredwings,lxt78wq,2024-11-18 15:12:35,I tried to find the old sources but I was unsuccessful. Friedman mentioned it once it’s possible it was on his pod and not written which makes it hard. He just said we were among the teams looking into him. It’s also entirely possible we looked into him said he’s a piece of shit and walked away. I just have always remembered that since it involves something that is important to me personally
detroitredwings,lxtdl0h,2024-11-18 15:44:52,"The people saying stuff like that are totally fair weather fans who don't know anything about the ""systems"" in hockey."
detroitredwings,lxtzokg,2024-11-18 17:38:16,"One phrase that I absolutely *loathe* that I've seen for years is ""play a full 60 minutes."" This isn't just a Wings thing I see it all over. Don't get me wrong. The Wings right now do have trouble playing a full 60 minutes. But in a perfectly evenly matched game there's probably about 15 minutes of you getting pressured 15 minutes of you pressuring the opponent and 30 minutes of random hockey shenanigans happening. If you lost that one closely you'd get hit with ""well they didn't play a full 60 minutes.""Anyway I don't know where that rant came from. :P"
detroitredwings,lxts8u1,2024-11-18 16:58:43,Ok yeah that makes sense.

detroitredwings,lxrljer,2024-11-18 10:17:52,It doesn’t have to be that black and white. Yzerman could have not valued Hronek’s skill set and role the same as Hronek does in negotiations. Doesn’t mean he’s not a good player but if Yzerman doesn’t think the fit and contract are right then moving him is the right decision. Our window does not hinge on a player who would be our 2nd pair RD.

detroitredwings,lxrfmiz,2024-11-18 09:43:50,ok ?  I live and breathe this city more than the rest of yall do so idrc. I'm pointing out the common theme of Detroit teams have bad ownership / coaches and as soon as they leave all of sudden team is better. Yzerman is stuck on stupid with who he hires for close to decade now and yall want to say keep waiting . Inexcusable and I expect better so yes both should be fired
detroitredwings,lxrsi9k,2024-11-18 10:55:38,That would be a must watch TV broadcast and NHL history.

detroitredwings,lxqrl3c,2024-11-18 06:54:28,I haven't felt this bad since 2019-2020 honestly.  No hope for the team currently.  I have little faith they will play well on any given day and they keep proving me right.  I don't know how to feel better about it.  I usually am not one to call for firings or big shakeups but I feel like that's the one thing that needs to happen in order for me to have any semblance of faith in this team.
detroitredwings,lxpp8n2,2024-11-18 00:20:53,I'm keeping my expectations low. It's a rebuild so who knows how long it's going to take. After watching the Red Wings for 30 years I knew it was gonna happen sooner or later. Some nights it can be fun to watch other nights not so much. I'm watching to see how the younger players develop. They're not winning a championship anytime soon. Maybe in 10 years they'll be contenders.
detroitredwings,lxpojpv,2024-11-18 00:15:09,I'm happy the Lions can distract me from the Wings right now
detroitredwings,lxr2cv3,2024-11-18 08:18:53,Also from Windsor. Not doing great. It's a good thing the Lions are doing well or else I'd probably go for a swim in the Detroit River. 
detroitredwings,lxpp2tt,2024-11-18 00:19:32,Nah it's been a struggle this year. The vibes were good to end last year and the team just doesn't seem to have their heart in it the same way so far this season
detroitredwings,lxq8yzq,2024-11-18 03:36:58,Nope we're in shambles right now. Need a spark of anything or it's going to be a long shitty season
detroitredwings,lxqlr9k,2024-11-18 05:58:21,Do you want our coach? If not we want him taken to the moon. And when I say taken I mean yeeted there on the back of a nuclear rocket
detroitredwings,lxqvi42,2024-11-18 07:27:46,The lions are what you’re looking for. The red wings are bad rn. Not even fun to watch it’s a real bummer
detroitredwings,lxr6bn1,2024-11-18 08:45:31,Not good. It took me forever but I am finally starting to doubt the Yzerplan. It just seems odd to me that we sign these random “defensively responsible” players to bigger contracts than they’re worth. That is not how Tampa won their cups. Also letting a coach just ruin a team for seasons at a time because you don’t want to fire him I think is the wrong move. Fire the coach and light a fire under everyone’s asses. I am so tired of having a team full of “200 foot guys” with two elite goal scorers who are neutered by the coach’s “low event hockey.” It’s not low event hockey if you’re getting out shot 40-12 every game. So it’s probably time to figure out what system works best with the players you have rather than trying to smash a square peg into a circular hole. We should be playing “our defense is atrocious so let’s pour it on and win 7-6 every game” style of hockey not “okay we’re up 2-1 in the first time to dump and change for the next two periods. Oh shit it’s 5-2 now?”
detroitredwings,lxppj43,2024-11-18 00:23:17,"To quote a favorite show?""Short answer? No. Long answer? Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo."""
detroitredwings,lxpssjq,2024-11-18 00:51:33,The team is old as shit. Up against the cap. And is actually the worst team in the league disguised by beyond elite goaltending so far this year. The franchise has 0 directions and there is no realistic path to contention in the next 5 years besides a player projected to be solid randomly becoming a superstar which happens 2 or 3 times a generation. It’s bad man. It’s really bad
detroitredwings,lxr19jp,2024-11-18 08:11:15,I’m only doing fine because for the first time in my life I’m more of a lions fan than a red wings fan. And we all know how that’s going. I was a diehard watch every game and keep up with the draft Wings fan throughout the whole rebuild because there were reasons to watch and be optimistic. Ever since the season after Seider and Raymond’s rookie seasons I’ve just felt defeated
detroitredwings,lxrcvnr,2024-11-18 09:27:11,"I love Steve Yzerman he was my role model growing up and I was over the moon when he came back to Detroit to bail us out from Ken Holland's trash heap. That said his roster construction over the last 4 years has been awful and this year it looks like the house of cards is collapsing. Our D core outside of Seider and Edvinsson is bottom of the league and it's been that way for his whole tenure. Outside of our top line we have no real offensive difference makers. That poor construction is coupled with the most boring brand of hockey that Derek Lalonde coaches. The system looks to clamp down the game and grind out the opponent and it worked the last two years. This year it looks like the players are burnt out on it and just don't care anymore. It looks like he's going to bear the brunt of Yzerman's missteps but even if he goes I don't know what it will actually do to ""fix"" this team. More and more it looks like Yzerman's tenure is headed in the wrong direction. He's drafted some great players and has built a good prospect system but his construction of the Wings roster has been below average at best."
detroitredwings,lxpok6k,2024-11-18 00:15:15,To answer your question. No. Better to focus on the Lions for now.Also. Yes. Detroit sports are THE SHIT!

Yes they may test my faith sometimes but then I remember back to when we couldn’t buy a win.  And we were responsible for taking hockey back years with the brawls remember those days guys?  I think everyone here would have a collective heart attack if they were witness to those days.Edit:  I think clips of those days are floating around YouTube.
detroitredwings,lxqrjqk,2024-11-18 06:54:08,The Lions are using up all the “good” around here right now and I’m good with that. Tigers had a playoff run and lions are dominating. Of the big 4 sports any year we have 2 contenders I’m perfectly ok with two teams sucking.
detroitredwings,lxqtai8,2024-11-18 07:09:22,Can the wings turn it around? Possibly. Will the wings turn it around? Doubtful. I think Lalonde should have to find a ride home lol the team needs a shot in the arm and he's doing such a lousy job that it's time to just rip the bandaid off.
detroitredwings,lxr3i0a,2024-11-18 08:26:43,I keep hearing and reading that the Wings have the best farm system and prospect pool of any NHL team.  Great!  Maybe it’s time to bring the kids up and let them play at the NHL level.  They cannot do any worse than the current team and maybe just maybe the OJT would get them to the NHL level quicker and we can start getting this team back on track.
detroitredwings,lxr8xjn,2024-11-18 09:02:23,They still have cover from the Lions but come February (hopefully after a Super Bowl win) if there are no signs of life from the Wings I get the feeling there's going to be big problems for Steve and friends.
detroitredwings,lxra6tp,2024-11-18 09:10:27,Agree with someone else: not only we are bad but we are so damn boring to watch. Even the game I went to last month it felt like a pre season game. No energy no care
detroitredwings,lxru37x,2024-11-18 11:04:00,As long as Detroit has an inept coaching staff (Blashill previously and now Lalonde) we’ll never see players at their best.Neither appears to have any functioning system and for the advanced stats and analytics crowd they’re shocked as to how we win any game…The old man that I am still uses the old eye test - we still suck most nights and appear incapable of playing at an NHL level.
detroitredwings,lxpz5t3,2024-11-18 01:51:59,We’re awful and the prospect pool is dull aside from ASP

detroitredwings,lxppkai,2024-11-18 00:23:34,I have no faith right now. If you can get into American football I’d watch the lions 
detroitredwings,lxqx5z2,2024-11-18 07:40:56,So the momentum from last year is just completely gone. It’s the same team that missed the playoffs but slower still outrageously soft on defense and somehow one of the oldest teams in the league.I’m getting the sinking feeling that our little run last year only reinforced bad parts of our team. I think it’s obvious now that Lalonde was never the answer but the depressing thing is that according to a lot of advanced stats he actually has us over performing our team’s outlook. The team is bad and arguably could still even be worse which sets the concern about what the team’s ceiling actually is.I thought our window was opening now but I think it’s clear this team is at least a year or two (and significant roster additions) away from even being better than a .500 team.I think we’re really starting to look at the prospect that whatever team the Wings put together that can compete will be past Larkin’s prime.

detroitredwings,lxs2azm,2024-11-18 11:46:36,We need our coach fired and our depth players to perform and our defensive game to improve and our goalies to be more consistent. Other than that it’s great! 
detroitredwings,lxs64o2,2024-11-18 12:06:00,I've been following college hockey and OHL more than NHL this year lol. Of course one's team can't always win or be good that's not my problem it's just the Wings are so damn boring to watch. I still turn the games on but moreso as background noise.
detroitredwings,lxs67xz,2024-11-18 12:06:28,"Steve's only strategy is ""sit on my hands"" so no nothing will be addressed or changed. Our own coach who has **completely** lost the room is telling our captain to fuck off during games now in front of the entire team and the front office is cool with it so that means there's no desire to be competitive or win games this season. Pretty big kick in the nuts to the fan base after how last season ended."
detroitredwings,lxscmcd,2024-11-18 12:38:40,"The fact that it happened at all is remarkable to me but the regression so far this year after being generally more fun to watch and almost make the playoffs has essentially killed any day to day interest for me.  I'll hop in here from time to time to see what I've been missing but it doesn't look like much.  Maybe the team with sort it out maybe there will be more changes and more time needed to become actually competitive who knows but I'm not interested in watching another slog of an uninspired season where rookies and prospects are overrated and where this team is perpetually ""almost there"".  It's ok though it's just meant to be entertainment and right now I'd rather spend my time on other things than continue investing in this team.  If/when they start winning and/or making things interesting like how the Tigers caught fire at the end of the baseball season I'll jump back on the bandwagon and feel not a single ounce of shame for it lol."

Detroit doesn’t have a roster built for success.  Yzerman hasn’t been as magical as some believe.   This is a what you see is what you get kind of team
detroitredwings,lxpqdb7,2024-11-18 00:30:23,GET OUTTA HERE(I’m fine. I’m fed and hydrated and spent a bunch of time outside today. Any team can turn anything around at any time but it’s not currently Gucci up in here)

detroitredwings,lxpsgmz,2024-11-18 00:48:36,The Habs are no better. I know it may not make you feel any better but I despise the current management and don’t see how they’ll progress any furtherAt least the Red Wings looked good last yearAlso I can safely say that I stood by my claim that the Tigers would make the playoffs back in May and look what happened. I’m hopeful for you guys maybe the team will awaken like the Oilers did last year but I won’t jinx them
detroitredwings,lxssxqb,2024-11-18 14:00:19,Regular season hockey is always boring.
detroitredwings,lxt157e,2024-11-18 14:41:34,At least the Griffins have been great to watch
detroitredwings,lxqqm0n,2024-11-18 06:45:43,Should caption that with Yzerfans.
detroitredwings,lxs43q3,2024-11-18 11:55:41,You can miss quite a lot actually. You can miss the Wings getting into opposing territory passing about 10 times between players both in front of the net and behind the net losing the puck while still in their play zone and having to fight opponents to retain possession losing possession and then watching the goalie have to make a save.That's like... 15 seconds. I haven't even gotten into the defensive players that for some reason will not pass. They just clear the puck out of their zone. I love Detroit but I recently went and saw a Flint Firebirds vs Saginaw Spirit game. I started wondering why Detroit doesn't have some of these players because they do play much more like a team trying to win not just keep the puck. Didn't really even care who won but it was an awesome game compared to a Wings game.

detroitredwings,lxrlqyd,2024-11-18 10:19:01,No kidding the Lions doing amazing and the Tigers surprising us all really makes this all more palatable. Hell even the Pistons are showing a little life.
detroitredwings,lxpu3kd,2024-11-18 01:03:30,Yeah i was really looking forward to carrying the momentum from last year then got hyped with kane re-signing despite the departures. But alas we are getting exposed every game and all the games ive watched most of the time is spent in our own zone and we rarely keep the puck in our offensive zone. Sigh.

detroitredwings,lxt0axd,2024-11-18 14:37:18,Seen them. While they are all each great shows with great writing.. Mad Men is still superior in my personal opinion. There’s something to be said about a show like Mad Men where the theme of the show is definitely not something I would instantly gravitate towards “1960’s era Advertising Agency” yet the cast the character developments the story.. it’s just so damn good that I fell in love with it.
detroitredwings,lxtp975,2024-11-18 16:43:37,That’s true - I’m saying reigning champs into the fourth quarter of this years natty
detroitredwings,lxsf0qv,2024-11-18 12:50:35,Buddy trust me. The future of the Habs is not looking bright. There is so much about the management that I hate: the severe lack of transparency the development the scouting acting like things need to stay the way they are on while on a sinking ship… I could go onI don’t think there’s anything more that Martin St. Louis can do for this team. And I never liked Hughes as a GM. He’s a guy who sees how players are on paper and makes miscalculated moves to bring in could-be’s but never players that actually do. I get scrutinized for liking Bergevin more but the team was actually respectable and made decent acquisitions (not including Drouin)
detroitredwings,lxpvt74,2024-11-18 01:19:30,Hockey “rebuilding” is so messed up. It doesn’t matter how well the management is put together how many good players are prospected drafted traded for or how close you get to clearing cap space it takes eons for results to show. I thought Y had gotten you guys so many good players like Kane Copp DeBrincat Rasmussen Holl Chiarot Petry Tarasenko etc.And again while it may not show I thought Y was building this team up. It’ll be a shame if he gets canned and THEN the Red Wings start playing goodUnfortunately the bulk of success now lies in the little shit State of Florida and it makes me sick
detroitredwings,lxsuply,2024-11-18 14:09:14,I said THE shitThere’s a difference
detroitredwings,lxtjj8n,2024-11-18 16:14:41,Mad Men is great. My comment was not an attempt to refute that claim and you are correct that they totally nailed both a theme and an era that otherwise aren’t largely thought about.
detroitredwings,lxsg5v5,2024-11-18 12:56:16,You guys have better young talent than the Wings it's just not as far along in development yet.  This Wings rebuild is textbook how to be mediocre forever.  Signing duds like Copp Chiarot Holl Petry Compher Gustafsson Tarasenko re-signing Rasmussen etc.  Giving away a 2nd round pick to u load wjat wpuld have been our 3rd best defenseman this season.  Yzerman has killed this rebuild via brutal UFA signings when he should have let the team continue to suck to try and get the offensive talent through the draft that they're still missing.
detroitredwings,lxpvyvb,2024-11-18 01:20:59,lmao holl chiarot and petry. i cannot stand those useless fuckers. edvinsson has his moments but he’s overall too soft for his size. senko was a good pickup but he’s a no show bc the entire team is soft as baby shit

detroitredwings,lxqr2uh,2024-11-18 06:49:55,Lol Tarasenko has been on the decline for the past 3 years and is 33 years old.Basically Perron 2.0And Edvinsson plays with an edge.
detroitredwings,lxr31ud,2024-11-18 08:23:40,Sad thing is Perron > Tarasenko.  We had the right guy and let him go.

detroitredwings,lxs7mc1,2024-11-18 12:13:37,I was going to say seeing his name just above Buch is a little disheartening Gusev was basically useless for the time he was in North America.

detroitredwings,lxqb78z,2024-11-18 04:02:09,If they're low division washouts  they aren't mid. They're bad.
detroitredwings,lxr2saa,2024-11-18 08:21:51,I think it’s less about the strength of the KHL (undoubtably weaker I’ll give you that) and more about his progression as a young player and his potential offensive ceiling. he’s on pace to triple almost his production from last year by rounding out his playmaking. Watching highlights from last year vs. this year his game looks less like a Kaprizov/young Tarasenko and more like a Panarin. Maybe I’m reading into it a bit too hard (similar height and weight) but he looks ready to take a leap. But I hear you about bottom of the barrel competition. My only counterpoint is that it’s still a grown man’s league playing a grown man’s game which should carry weight vs. many junior leagues.
detroitredwings,lxq6dhe,2024-11-18 03:08:03,Yeah KHL is pretty watered down now days.
detroitredwings,lxrvuap,2024-11-18 11:13:17,I think that comparison was before he rounded out his game. I think he’s more of a playmaker that can also finish than a 1v9 sniper type player.
detroitredwings,lxsrs35,2024-11-18 13:54:36,Give me a near PPG guy I don’t care if he is making up most of his points in assists
detroitredwings,lxshdzb,2024-11-18 13:02:25,Let's not go counting any unhatched chickens just yet.  I'm a big fan of the Buchelnikov pick and he's done wel so far but he's still light years away from being in the NHL and producing at a top 6 level(but damn do I hope he can one day).
detroitredwings,lxpczi3,2024-11-17 22:50:27,Try 1-2 years.He’s out performing kaprizov and panarin at his age……

detroitredwings,lxsbvx2,2024-11-18 12:35:01,Comparing a 21 year olds numbers to a 32 year old and saying it’s disheartening is a wild take.

detroitredwings,lxt1zgi,2024-11-18 14:45:48,Maybe disheartening was a poor word choice just that the KHL success doesn’t guarantee NHL success. Gusev was like 27 when he came over also.

detroitredwings,lxrth18,2024-11-18 11:00:43,A 6th round pick? That’s not considered high end. He’s still very much a project.
detroitredwings,lxsvlp0,2024-11-18 14:13:42,He was drafted in like the 6th round.
detroitredwings,lxsguzs,2024-11-18 12:59:44,I'm not convinced MBN won't become the best of he Danielson and Kasper.  None project to be real offensive weapons though unfortunately.  Danielson is the one probably most important to the team to hit his potential ceiling because the Wings need talent at center badly.
detroitredwings,lxpeds0,2024-11-17 23:00:11,No I’m just saying the original commenter may be right as it’ll probably be a little longer than we want until we see him in a winged wheel.
detroitredwings,lxpei01,2024-11-17 23:01:00,I mean 7 years seems a little far out no?
detroitredwings,lxpfbhk,2024-11-17 23:06:44,Yeah I think he was being sarcastic but still I think we’re talking more like 3-4yrs rather than 1-2. But who knows. God knows we need scoring right now.

detroitredwings,lxn0jiq,2024-11-17 14:39:05,Dude’s getting ripped at the Lions game and effing with his phone. Let him cook!
detroitredwings,lxojuqb,2024-11-17 19:47:36,I was so confused like he's already in the ahl contributing 0 to the cap no reason we'd want to waive him again but the player assistance program outputting people into the nhl where they have to be re waived makes sense
detroitredwings,lxn5lc8,2024-11-17 15:06:41,Lol not gunna lie I saw the title but didn't look at the sub and I literally was about to lose my shit
detroitredwings,lxoajvk,2024-11-17 18:53:56,Why would bandwagon lions fans also be on the red wings subreddit?

detroitredwings,lxnw30l,2024-11-17 17:30:00,Damn that’s a rough go for him. Rooting for him to get his career back on track or at least find a good place to be
detroitredwings,lxotz4e,2024-11-17 20:49:21,They reassigned another goalie to the griffins before this so... im not sure what any of it means lol
detroitredwings,lxnk6ps,2024-11-17 16:24:31,I don't think any team is claiming him with 0 games played this season and the way he played last season.
detroitredwings,lxogxys,2024-11-17 19:30:27,What?
detroitredwings,lxox4p4,2024-11-17 21:08:47,No? He was signed during the offseason to the Detroit Red Wings which automatically puts him in the NHL until waived. Yes he was playing for the AHL and then waived for buyout by the Oilers but when signed by an NHL team he becomes on an NHL roster until waived. AHL teams can sign players independently of their NHL affiliates. So he was signed to Detroit and was not waived prior to entering the program. If the team wished they could accept him immediately into their roster or conditioning stint assign him to the Griffins for some practice or as they have done waive him to fully assign to a lower league. It’s unlikely he was ever signed to play in Detroit so being waived was always the going to be the case and as you said there was no contribution to the cap before or after the PAP.Detroit wasn’t forced to waive him a second time and even if they were waiving him a second time it’s immaterial as he isn’t going to be claimed and if he is claimed…………..so what? Cap is gone regardless.
detroitredwings,lxogv82,2024-11-17 19:30:00,I’m a hockey fan first and foremost and don’t give a hoot about football most the time. I consider myself a fan of any Detroit team but I’m not going to follow Football Basketball or Baseball when they’re down so I am in effect a bandwagon fan. (Disclaimer I’m not the type to act as though I was there the whole time and yell from the rooftops but I perk up) So by rights swing the “Jack Campbell” I could get think one particular thing over the other. I’m a obtuse nerd about shit and it doesn’t exactly apply to me but I could see how others might read the name and not see the subreddit posting the news and jump to a conclusion too quickly.
detroitredwings,lxnuuok,2024-11-17 17:23:08,Yeah Blashill had a super impressive resume too.
detroitredwings,lxnsbew,2024-11-17 17:09:06,Don’t take him away from us just yet! He has this Griffins team on a roll right now!
detroitredwings,lxn5ddu,2024-11-17 15:05:30,That's what I'm thinking.I don't see them keeping 3 in Grand Rapids especially with Husso being impressive as fuck.
detroitredwings,lxn8wdz,2024-11-17 15:24:34,I don't think so Bednar Alexander and Gylander are all 22 and under contract with the Red Wings and all need PT.  I don't mind having 3 in GR especially how often Husso gets lower body injuries since St Louis.  I think he might have bad knees or something.
detroitredwings,lxoszzg,2024-11-17 20:43:20,That would be a depressing downfall to a career plagued by issues……. ECHL YIKES! I bet he is loaned to a different AHL team rather than demoted to the ECHL.
detroitredwings,lxnlban,2024-11-17 16:30:40,Certainly likely they don’t. However Kahkonen and Reimer have both been claimed multiple times this year and his contract is fully buriable if it doesn’t work out. I just wouldn’t be shocked if a team took a chance
detroitredwings,lxpgkzd,2024-11-17 23:15:48,That's a fair weather fan not a bandwagon fan
detroitredwings,lxnvsxn,2024-11-17 17:28:26,Blashill dealt with one of the worst rosters in team history. Vast majority of the players under Blashill arent even in the NHL anymore.
detroitredwings,lxogvh5,2024-11-17 19:30:03,Are you assuming that everyone agrees Blashill was a bad coach? Otherwise your comment doesn't really make sense. But that seems like a poor assumption.
detroitredwings,lxnk4b0,2024-11-17 16:24:09,Bednar was not resigned by the Red Wings this past offesason. His contract is with Grand Rapids.
detroitredwings,lxn9kj3,2024-11-17 15:28:07,I don’t think I’ve ever seen playing time abbreviated as PT when PT is so often associated with physical therapy/trainjng. Not wrong though those guys all need to be getting minutes
detroitredwings,lxnetm4,2024-11-17 15:56:03,I'm not super worried about ECHL goaltending one way or the other.
detroitredwings,lxs2rxo,2024-11-18 11:48:58,I would look at Toledo more like a rehab assignment more than a set destination. Campbell hasn’t played in quite a while now can’t just throw him right out there even in gr. Toledo is more open to get him a few games in and see what he has left or not. No point coming back and riding the pine in gr until huasso gets hurt again.
detroitredwings,lxo31qe,2024-11-17 18:09:52,That’s a more than fair point.
detroitredwings,lxohtva,2024-11-17 19:35:39,Not terrible but his resume of winning at every level was touted as why he would be a big part of the solution and wasn’t. I think this team needs a proven NHL coach.
detroitredwings,lxnmso6,2024-11-17 16:38:48,Ahh gotcha he hasn't performed well since being drafted makes sense.  He had a bit of a bounce-back year last year though.
detroitredwings,lxnny1l,2024-11-17 16:45:06,PT is more commonly used in basketball and football in my experience
detroitredwings,lxnggje,2024-11-17 16:04:19,I could care less about Toledo but these young guys are contracted with the Red Wings is what I care about.  They aren't Toledo or Griffin contracts.
detroitredwings,lxsee5a,2024-11-18 12:47:28,I get ya. Makes perfect sense. Let the guy build some confidence.
detroitredwings,lxol0f4,2024-11-17 19:54:32,"Why wasn't he? What do you think he was evaluated on exactly? I'm concerned that your analysis is essentially ""he lost a lot therefore he was bad."""
detroitredwings,lxnn687,2024-11-17 16:40:54,Alexander was a contract throw in it’s looking unlikely he will be an AHL goalie let alone an NHL goalie. I’m not sure I can think of a guy who made the NHL being that bad at age 22. He also hasn’t played this year not sure if that’s injury or just being the 3. Bednar isn’t in the Wings orgA Gylander Campbell rotation would be fine
detroitredwings,lxnygmw,2024-11-17 17:43:31,I dunno I guess I'm just not worried about Carter Gylander's development.
detroitredwings,lxp0hv2,2024-11-17 21:29:40,He's to invested in being friends with most of the players to be a head coach assistant coach serms like a better fit. He put Sheahan on PP1 and the top line with 0 goals in over a calendar season all just to try to get his buddy a goal.
detroitredwings,lxnzd9j,2024-11-17 17:48:42,Lotta goalies are late bloomers.  The only guy to go from the SPHL to NHL was a goalie Scott Darling had a few good years too.  Gotta give them a chance to develop you never know with goalies at that age.
detroitredwings,lxo1ea9,2024-11-17 18:00:20,Yeah but also we have a dozen goalies ahead of him on the chart.
detroitredwings,lxn74a9,2024-11-17 15:15:02,Can we appreciate how productive Cat has been. A really steady bright spot
detroitredwings,lxl1kca,2024-11-17 07:33:11,This is my least favorite version of the Wings. When they were record setting levels of terrible at least I could look forward to the draft. When they were a bubble playoff team at least I had slight hope. Being in the bottom tier around middle of the pack of that tier results in my least favorite sports emotion: Apathy.
detroitredwings,lxlnvq4,2024-11-17 10:12:20,Buch 3 pt game so far. Now up to 26 points in 27 games behind only Tarasenko in PPG for any 21 year old KHLer with a 20 game minimum. Game is only half over.
detroitredwings,lxlrv8k,2024-11-17 10:35:51,We starting the fire newsy chant next home game
detroitredwings,lxmbvkm,2024-11-17 12:27:25,Ok ok. I'm finally on board with firing Lalonde.
detroitredwings,lxmzdas,2024-11-17 14:32:47,Not hockey because daily thread.I started building a breakfast nook in my kitchen in September. I finally put the final trim on today mounted my silly little electric fireplace and started the last step of poly'ing the table. All built from scratch. I am so tired of this project but damn am I proud of it and so happy it's nearly complete.

detroitredwings,lxlfjky,2024-11-17 09:19:11,They're so much worse than last year it's such a bummer. Pretty soon Mick will be telling us about sod just so there's something to pay attention to.
detroitredwings,lxnd2gf,2024-11-17 15:46:54,Dan Campbell throwing a challenge flag when he's up by like 50 lol...ruthless
detroitredwings,lxl7vyr,2024-11-17 08:24:23,I try to stay positive and look for the little things (hence the side quests) but this team really is a tough watch at the moment. Last night's side quests: X  1. 20 shots on goal 2. Larkin goal or assist 3. Less than 3 minor penaltiesX  4. Ed healthyX  5. Mo or Ray get a pointX  6. Berggy scores
detroitredwings,lxl62ty,2024-11-17 08:10:26,This team plays like a bottom 5 team and I look forward to our bottom 5 pick. At least it’s the plug veterans and coach who are massively underperforming and not really the kids. Throw in even more kids at the trade deadline (Mazur and danielson get looks?).Let the fire burn us down and use the disaster season for positive change. High pick 2-3 rookies again next year 20M in space for *non plugs* (don’t fuck up the pro scouting this time please) and a new coach in the off-season would do us wonders. Everyone is always crowing about elite talent. Well here’s another shot at it. Cause boy does the system help us stink. I don’t think another coach makes this team a playoff team but I do think they get us out of the bottom ten. So why bother making the change this year? We’re already in the bottom 10 and that’s us *over-performing* our performances. Give me one final shot at elite talent here. And then use the disaster as a catalyst to change this team for the better. The country club ends now.

detroitredwings,lxleyix,2024-11-17 09:15:12,The vibes were not good last night. The boys faces looked defeated before the puck dropped. I still find it hard to scapegoat lalonde for everything so far this season but last night was not a good sign for him. Maybe it was a blip on the second night of a back to back but it looked to me like the boys gave up/lost confidence and if lalonde loses the room I don't think it will matter who else is available on the coaching market.
detroitredwings,lxlzoxx,2024-11-17 11:20:10,Poor Larkin man. I wonder if he ever sees the postseason again in Detroit
detroitredwings,lxl42f7,2024-11-17 07:54:39,Fun fact we've been held to 1 or fewer goals for 25% (roughly) of the season.I don't think that's good
detroitredwings,lxl44ea,2024-11-17 07:55:07,I figured we would have 2 points at this stage of the trip (a win over Ducks). But I was so hopeful when we beat Pitt and took that 3-1 lead in Anaheim. Wins and losses aside we are not passing the eye test with our on ice play. There are games where we look like a beer league team: passes in the skates blown coverage and at times lack of effort/conditioning. You'd think we would have developed some consistency after 15-16 games. There are games that it looks like we don't even practice together and just lace em up and play freestyle pond hockey. I wonder if they're either trying too hard to play Newsy style hockey (and failing)  or they don't givashit and it's the players passive-aggressive way to give Newsy the finger and get him and his bullshit system fired?
detroitredwings,lxljdc1,2024-11-17 09:44:30,I was admittedly a Lalonde apologist last year and through the first month. But boy oh boy... It gets harder every day not to believe that a new coach would be a really good thing. I still love Uncle Fester he seems like a cool dude but something has to change. You can analyze it to bits but the end result is still the same: it's not working
detroitredwings,lxm37f1,2024-11-17 11:39:27,"Me sometimes: I think I can get why we should consider being more free to post things outside of the daily discussion.Me last night after there's 5 different posts which are really just variations of ""Lalonde bad"" after last night's game: Actually nevermind."
detroitredwings,lxm6w5t,2024-11-17 11:59:42,Griffins are looking great. Lombardi Danielson and Hanas all starting to breakout. Snivley & Watson looking like great veteran additions. Cossa & Husso playing great. Future is bright

detroitredwings,lxp6ukd,2024-11-17 22:09:34,I’m depressed
detroitredwings,lxkyui1,2024-11-17 07:07:54,Hate me all you want. It's either win in amazing fashion on monday or Lalonde shouldn't be allowed on the plane after.
detroitredwings,lxl9kgn,2024-11-17 08:36:46,Even my optimism is starting to fade. I intentionally didn’t watch the game last night and I’m happy I didn’t. Sounds like it was another wet blanket of a game.I’m starting to be on the fire newsy camp I know he didn’t buy the ingredients but they need someone now who can make the most of them and I’m certain newsy isn’t that guy.

detroitredwings,lxopkdh,2024-11-17 20:22:15,The Pistons are now one game out of .500 (7-8) and the Lions are tied for the lead in the NFL. Wings cannot lose tomorrow they have to play like their season is on the line.
detroitredwings,lxlb9m5,2024-11-17 08:49:08,Sometimes certain games just take the wind out of your sails a bit and last night that was kinda night. I’m still constantly saying it’s still pretty early but sooner than later it won’t be early anymore. But still a bit of time. At least the younger guys have looked good.

detroitredwings,lxlhvxh,2024-11-17 09:34:51,This season is miserable to watch. When Lalonde first got here and even last year this team had no quit.We would often come back and even if we didn't we played hard .Now we pack it in after being down a couple goals.This team is broken.Getting so close to the playoffs and coming up short has done a number to this team.We definitely need a new voice.It's like the last Blashil seasonEveryone looks checked out and there's no light in their eyes.We all know Lalonde needs to go but chances are he'll be here till MarchSteve will let this team bottom out and hope we can win the lottery.We'll waste another LarkinSeider and Raymond season.

detroitredwings,lxmhs90,2024-11-17 13:00:06,"Rant to a bunch of people who I'm sure already know this.In the thread where that one guy was hyping up Q as coach one thing I saw suggested a bit is firing Lalonde and bringing in a coach from outside the system ""until the end of the season.""That's not a thing. No coach is going to a team for just a few months. If you're going to have an interim coach it's gonna come from inside. McLellan isn't going to move his family coach in Detroit for a few months and then happily get kicked to the curb lol. If you're hiring a coach now and not just using an interim you should *at least* expect them to stay until the end of next season. Yeah you can always fire him but that isn't a good look when you're trying to get the top-notch coaches of the world when it matters most.Anyway carry on. :P"
detroitredwings,lxmpuxz,2024-11-17 13:42:53,No amount of red wings losses will disappoint me more than my dynasty football team. 6 years in the league… 5 years of rebuilding… 3 wins this season.

detroitredwings,lxmdory,2024-11-17 12:37:29,I think if this season ends up being rocky like this all year long it won’t be detrimental to our progress. I don’t think just because we have a bad season this year that it means we will be bad next year. Just need Yzerman to make some really big moves this offseason and a coaching change. If we keep blowing leads or getting shutout like we have been then the coaching change will need to come sooner than later.

detroitredwings,lxmgzwt,2024-11-17 12:55:47,Time on ice last night has some oddities. Kane led all forwards with a touch over a minute more than Larkin and Debrincat and almost 2 minutes more than Raymond. Mo unsurprisingly had 25:29 but somewhat surprising is only a -1. Kane somehow was even. And Larkin DeBrincat and Raymond all -2 I know plus minus isn’t much of a stat but it can be interesting to look at occasionally

detroitredwings,lxlurfu,2024-11-17 10:52:27,One thing with these stop gap contracts that really gets me is that none of these guys seem like leaders. None of them strike me as example setters for the young guns to guide them to be everyday pros in the NHL. Besides the whole marinating in GR for too long thing I worry about the development of some of the young players on the Wings not getting the proper mentorship from the vets. Think of Nick Foligno on the Hawks a team who is supposed to be bad but has some very promising young players. He seems to be doing a decent job setting the example for those kids to grow into the league. Do any of our stop gaps appear to be doing the same here? I don't think so.
detroitredwings,lxmue20,2024-11-17 14:06:27,On a positive note Griffins had a good game last night against the Admirals. They’re now top of their division by 4 points and tied for second in the league.
detroitredwings,lxms7nj,2024-11-17 13:55:13,I keep seeing a lot of Tanguay as interim coach but I’m not so sure. He’s obviously having some powerplay success and I don’t know if they’d want to split his duties off from that. I could see Boughner getting the Interim title and leaving the powerplay alone. I don’t think Boughner is it but  he’s coached the NHL level before and is above Bettman .500 (147-147-45) I don’t know though I’m just some idiot online. I just don’t know about fiddling with what is a small bright spot of the team in the powerplay systems.

detroitredwings,lxl9hsb,2024-11-17 08:36:11,I kind of want Kane off this team
detroitredwings,lxlookt,2024-11-17 10:17:08,Well at least I can watch football all day and pretend this team doesn't exist for a while.
detroitredwings,lxmmbk7,2024-11-17 13:24:31,I feel bad but man I’m grateful for a night off more than usual lol
detroitredwings,lxmnzjb,2024-11-17 13:33:18,My best guess as to what happens next is that Steve lets go of Lalonde no later than the first week of December in an attempt to try and salvage the season. Illitch won’t support the funding to pay two head coach salaries so I think that Steve will promote Alex Tanguay to interim head coach to try and give us a jolt. If Tanguay does great then it helps his position to land a permanent job here or somewhere else. Not an endorsement per se but just a thought on what might happen.
detroitredwings,lxnir7t,2024-11-17 16:16:40,The Bears looooool.
detroitredwings,lxnnbeh,2024-11-17 16:41:40,Jets or bears what fan base had it worse today.  Haha
detroitredwings,lxmtv6e,2024-11-17 14:03:43,Yzerman is still preaching patience 5 years later. Hes still telling everyone we're not there yet. That it takes time to build the foundations for a team with a long window. I don't think for a second that someone as competitive as Stevie who wants to win as badly as Stevie would be content with us meandering through what seems to be a losing season without making changes unless it's intentional. if Stevie thinks we should be legitimately pushing for the playoffs and this poor play continues we will see a move whether that's with coaching or roster moves. If he doesn't think we're there then we're not going to see anything significant during the season regardless of the play. I think Steve has a different view of this team our trajectory and our timeline and that's why he basically hasn't changed his messaging in 5 years despite us fans having increased expectations that maybe aren't reflected internally. Steve is still preaching patience even if the fans are running out of it. You can disagree with him but I think it's more closer to a difference in perspective of where we're at rather than front office incompetence like more and more seem to be suggesting 
detroitredwings,lxm6pvk,2024-11-17 11:58:44,"So I know most everyone is focused on Lalonde and that's fair. I do see a bunch calling for Stevey though and sure he needs to shoulder some blame too. But when it comes to FA signings and people saying we should have got this guy instead of this guy or signed ghost instead of letting him go... You do all realize that just because they're a FA doesn't mean they have to sign here right? They're free to go and sign with whoever they want for whatever they want.Sure we can pursue someone and offer them more than another but that doesn't mean they need to take our offer.With ghost at least I'm sure Stevey offered him a decent enough contract but did everyone forget that we hadn't yet signed Raymond or seider yet? Sure hindsight says maybe we could have afforded him but then it'd cause issues in cap available for those two. Or issues with signing Kane again. There is a lot to consider when signing FAs and again at any point a FA might just say no because they want to sign in Florida or Cali or go west coast be closer to family.I hate seeing these comments about FAs that we ""missed"" out on because they signed elsewhere when the contract they signed clearly wouldn't have fit our cap space or maybe that player straight up did not want to sign with us. Some of them I'm sure Stevey didn't bother trying seriously but if you or I can see someone that would benefit the team and could be a good signing I'm sure he at least tossed an offer or opened up some form of communication. If the player refused or had other desires then that's not on Stevey.Again I'm not blind here and saying he hasn't made mistakes because he absolutely has. But some of the signings might be a bit reactionary because the desired player didn't want to sign with us for whatever reason and we need ""something""."

I truly don’t understand why people expect Yzerman to have done this faster is it that people are counting the wasted Holland years? Or they’re blinded by something like the Rangers being gifted a perennial Hart candidate and striking gold on a top 3 goalie in the world? I have gripes with Yzerman but those don’t really relate to us being good or bad now they’re more about longevity. Last night was horrid and I would be ok with a coaching change at this point because that’s the NHL cycle. But the level of obsession with Lalonde or thinking a coaching change with morph us into a team that we’re not is frankly stupid
detroitredwings,lxlt0v0,2024-11-17 10:42:29,Does anyone know where to buy those red wings shirts that look like political campaign shirts? I’m sure there are several varieties but one might be like “Yzerman & Lidstrom ‘98” in big block letters. I really thought they were from Vintage Detroit but I couldn’t find them on their website
detroitredwings,lxmo6bw,2024-11-17 13:34:18,I’m thinking of moving on from Hulu live to YouTube TV but am unsure if I can get most Wings games on it. Does anyone here use YouTube TV? The wings games are the most important to have for me.

detroitredwings,lxo04sn,2024-11-17 17:53:02,People really don't seem to understand that guys like Copp Compher Chiarot etc etc were never meant to be part of a winning core. They are the insulation until the core arrives. Their contracts really don't matter in the grand scheme. Same with Lalonde. It's about development and not being a complete dumpster fire in the meantime so our prospects can have a somewhat semi-positive environment to develop in. Thats the goal more so than being immediately competive. Would sneaking in the playoffs be good for our young players? Yes it would be great. But we're not spending assets in the short term to rob the long term of its goal. In general we have been accomplishing that. Yes this year has been disappointing but our development is still trending in the right direction. Whether anyone wants to admit that or not.
detroitredwings,lxn1a37,2024-11-17 14:43:07,Campbell despite knowing little about hockey would be a better coach than Lalonde.Talking about how despite being way up on the opponent pretend like it's 0-0 and don't change what you're doing.I'm so sick of games being pissed away playing turtle hockey
detroitredwings,lxoyv9v,2024-11-17 21:19:33,Will be down voted for this but idrgafNewsy is only a minuscule part of the problem Reality is last year we over performed r PDO% and had a pp qb and Jake Walman… this year we are 0/3 from the field. If you want to place blame look no further than the pro scouting department.

detroitredwings,lxm6qm9,2024-11-17 11:58:51,What really burns me is that I gave Lalonde the benefit of the doubt the past 3 years buying into the “we’re in a rebuild phase” and now I feel totally played.  We wasted 3-4 years now and I don’t think the rebuild has really even started.

detroitredwings,lxlwxz8,2024-11-17 11:04:54,Okay so clearly Lalonde needs to go but what should our lines be? What I would move them to for the SJ gameRaymond Larkin CatKane Kasper BergsSenko compher veleno/motteRas Copp FisherEd SeiderPetry ChariotHoll AlJoI actually don’t mind the first second and fourth lines. Second line might get shelled but I felt like in the small sample size we have Kane showed good chemistry with Kasper and I would rather get shelled with young guys who are growing than with vets whose best days are behind them. I also think long term if the season falls apart this would help Kane get more points (instead of playing with the Compher Copp black hole) making him a more valuable trade piece at the deadlineHopefully that fourth line can turn back into a decent grinding line. The Copp experiment is over lower him back to 4th line where he belongs.The third line is an abortion and I would say any of those guys could sit a game if they play poorly… what the heck has happened to Compher this year?On D I actually don’t love Seider and Ed together just because that’s 30-40 minutes a game where one of them is not on the ice but I feel like leaving either on an island could stunt long term growth. Our second D pair is an abortion but we are kinda stuck. Finally they can go ahead and shootGus into the Sun at this point.Now if we are completely out of it in March/April this is the YOLO lineup I would do (assuming SHL year is over)Raymond Larkin CatKane Kasper bergssenko danielson Lombardi4th line can be the leftover of whoever is playing well at the timeSeider EdASP ChariotAlJo Petry/HollOne note if we do this I would NOT bring up Cossa this team could be fun but defensively likely gets shelledThird line is clearly a futures play but we could shuffle guys on second and third line if Kane is tradedOn D I would give ASP the green light to chip in at any point and also make him second team PP so we can see how his game translates to North American ice

detroitredwings,lxmzqrw,2024-11-17 14:34:44,I don't understand why any assistant coach would be slotted directly into an NHL head coaching position. IMO get them down to the AHL and give them a year or two just like we do with players.  If the Griffins head coach is doing a bang-up job then bring him up and put Lalonde on waivers.
detroitredwings,lxsb3gc,2024-11-18 12:31:02,It’s hard to care about this team right now when there are more exciting teams (Lions) to focus on and support with my money. Even the Tigers gave us more. I was going to buy a DRW sweater for my husband’s birthday but the other day he said he’s embarrassed of the Wings right now. I got a Lions sweater instead. I hope Chris Ilitch learned from the Tigers and understands that a good team = more eyeballs and money in his pocket.

Let the team tank and get rid of some of the deadweight this off season/TDL. The only reason to keep Lalonde around till year end is because there will be a lot more options available at the end of the year. If we keep playing this bad there is no way things don’t change in a big way.

But with these lines at least our first and second could get some fresh life into them feel like our first line has not lived up to their expectations 5v5.. our second line is .. dead. This third and 4th line could stay above water perhaps not the biggest threat offensively but still.

detroitredwings,lxmomyd,2024-11-17 13:36:37,The timeout thing is (and was) a giant nothing burger. NHL timeouts are so unimportant that most teams rarely use them and I couldn't even find a site that tracks them as a stat. Taking every one of our available timeouts would not have affected our record at all.There are so many bigger issues with this team and the coach that this is a pointless topic. It's like complaining about peeling paint on a burning barn.

It was immediately after he scored and headed towards the bench.EDIT: i just watched it they do not show it. Essentially he's skating back to the bench and makes the TO gesture with his hands presumably so the coaching staff calls one and they can catch their breath but Lalonde decided against it for whatever reason.

detroitredwings,lxnyw4b,2024-11-17 17:45:58,"I thought the worst loss in Jaguars history was the day Shad said to his idiot son; ""I'm going to buy an NFL team so stop talking about wrestling for five fucking seconds."""

detroitredwings,lxo7drn,2024-11-17 18:35:26,An actual Zamboni or the gravy boat? 
detroitredwings,lxoj5w4,2024-11-17 19:43:33,Passer rating is so broken. Secret Base had a good video explaining the stupid rules behind the maximum and minimum scores.
detroitredwings,lxm3qhk,2024-11-17 11:42:20,If Ken Holland had signed half of the FA contracts Yzerman has this sub would have been insufferable about that for the last 2+ seasons.
detroitredwings,lxmsn99,2024-11-17 13:57:24,The Boogeyman is my choice of we're sticking with Wings staff only.Hell the Zamboni driver could be a better option than Lalonde.
detroitredwings,lxp8l7g,2024-11-17 22:20:52,fuck cancer
detroitredwings,lxlvv7v,2024-11-17 10:58:49,If the coach doesn't care and the front office doesn't care it's not a surprise the team doesn't care.I hope the team goes full PLD and just aimlessly skates around next game
detroitredwings,lxlm77p,2024-11-17 10:02:12,I don't agree with it but he knows we weren't going to win the Cup anyway so us getting a better draft pick and potentially winning the lottery is a solid gamble.I don't think there is any real danger about our long term pieces wanting to get traded.Kane probably doesn't come back but he hasn't exactly been a world beater anyway.Maybe he fires Lalonde 3/4 through the season to kick the team in the butt while securing a top 10 or even top 5 pick
detroitredwings,lxndpns,2024-11-17 15:50:15,Gallant has consistently shown that young guys aren't his jam so I don't want him in charge. As far as Q is concerned the last thing an organization needs during a rebuild is self-inflicted drama. Let some other team be the one to weather that storm.
detroitredwings,lxncndn,2024-11-17 15:44:46,Q and Gallant are terrible options.I don't see why amateur scouting needing a shake up is a controversial take.We really have nothing to show outside of the 1st round and there are teams Dallas that consistently pick up late round gems.Pro Scouting needs work too. Far too many pieces that just aren't clicking and that's not considering the guys we picked up then abandoned like VranaSunny and Walman
detroitredwings,lxnsv6p,2024-11-17 17:12:08,I don't think the Campbell should be the coach comments are actually serious.
detroitredwings,lxnmfi1,2024-11-17 16:36:48,They understand puck go in net make happy more puck in net make happy.What they don’t seem to get is the NHL is hard the best teams play good defense and Yzerman is confined by the FA market and draft which he’s been hamstrung by.I think the goalie situation looks good very well settled there defense…having Mo and Ed playing together for some reason gets taken for granted on here and they’re playing so well. Ajo looks like he’ll be a top 4 D as well he’s done well there. Forwards…I don’t know shit about the wizardry they do and how that works I was a goalie. Coaching seems to be the most obvious and changeable thing. I definitely think fire newsy bc it’s the easiest way to shake up the team.
detroitredwings,lxngefx,2024-11-17 16:04:00,so enlighten us mr. big shot what would you do?
detroitredwings,lxnyf4h,2024-11-17 17:43:17,There needs to be a texting service to remind me of all these great celebrations.  I'll never forgive myself for missing out on celebrating National Reuben Day.
detroitredwings,lxnu30x,2024-11-17 17:18:57,I just want a good corned beef sandwich. Miss me with all that sauerkraut and salad dressing
detroitredwings,lxoqwxd,2024-11-17 20:30:31,Fuck me. Guess I’ll just have to celebrate tomorrow.
detroitredwings,lxokcu5,2024-11-17 19:50:36,Yeah.  I was watching the Blues - Canes game and it was making me pretty grumpy to watch Ghost and Necas score at will.  
detroitredwings,lxotgjo,2024-11-17 20:46:09,There's always going to be an 'if only' move at the draft but looking back on Lindstrom over Robertson still stings.  Taking a skilled forward with some work to do used to be the type of pick that the Wings excelled at instead we went with a guy with third pairing potential.
detroitredwings,lxphqty,2024-11-17 23:24:03,I agree that we could have had him but am not sure whether we could have developed him properly in our system.
detroitredwings,lxojh4o,2024-11-17 19:45:23,Holland and company really did us dirty.Not giving Steve a free pass by any means but if we had NecasRobertson and Hughes we'd be way better off.
detroitredwings,lxqdbp7,2024-11-18 04:26:08,> If my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bicycleWat
detroitredwings,lxmsp5u,2024-11-17 13:57:41,Report that shit to the FCC when it happens. It’s a law for tv broadcasts but if enough people make a stink about it for streaming it might be addressed sometime in the next 25 years
detroitredwings,lxm1mng,2024-11-17 11:30:46,After the goal Larkin visibly signaled to the bench for a timeout.  They didn’t call a timeout.  So yes Lalonde ignored his team’s captain there.I genuinely don’t understand what the guy has against calling timeouts.
detroitredwings,lxm2q43,2024-11-17 11:36:48,Yeah. It’s easy to see why the boys have no drive to play for this clown. I wouldn’t listen to anything he had to say if he’s literally telling my own captain to fuck off during games. 
detroitredwings,lxm4jxl,2024-11-17 11:46:49,Yes but also maybe no? It looks like he calls for a timeout making a T with his hands but to a fidgety person like myself it also looks like he could’ve been tapping his gloves into position. I’ve never played I don’t know how gloves fit but when I’m at work I’ll adjust my tight fitting gloves often. Pushing them deep on my fingers or kicking my boots against one another to adjust them back and forth. That’s probably just the optimistic side of me. It looks like he calls for Time but tried to be sly about it.
detroitredwings,lxohzd3,2024-11-17 19:36:32,We're already off the map.We lost to the fucking ducks after leading most of the game and barely beat the Penguins.We struggle against teams with a winning record and can't reliably win against teams with a losing record.This team is cooked unless something changes.
detroitredwings,lxl9qxw,2024-11-17 08:38:06,Agreed. He's been terrible this year however on a different team he can still be a positive addition. He'll be traded I believe. Only a matter of time.
detroitredwings,lxlef62,2024-11-17 09:11:27,Yes. He can only play in the o zone but we never get there with any sound possession
detroitredwings,lxlm8rx,2024-11-17 10:02:27,Love him on the pp but his 5 on 5 has really deteriorated.
detroitredwings,lxmpsev,2024-11-17 13:42:32,I think Chris can afford paying two coaches. Especially after he slapped on the Trash Patch
detroitredwings,lxn6wu0,2024-11-17 15:13:56,Too bad nothing will change. No game changers on this roster or in GR
detroitredwings,lxnskhr,2024-11-17 17:10:28,The bears at least have hope the jets are a joke.
detroitredwings,lxnykm1,2024-11-17 17:44:09,Jets. Reasonably sure that Peyton and Jeff transfer the Bobby Lane curse to the Bears when no one was looking.
detroitredwings,lxmwjmc,2024-11-17 14:17:40,He was one who run out of patiance not fans.
detroitredwings,lxn5x5l,2024-11-17 15:08:29,Look what they've done this isn't a wait and see roster. You don't burn picks to move guys and regain cap then spend the cap if your content to just play the kids and see what happens. They think this is a playoff team and it's ridiculous you put that blue line out there and think you can win.
detroitredwings,lxmuv1k,2024-11-17 14:08:52,Disagree. If that was the case we wouldn’t have our roster taking up 100% of our cap space
detroitredwings,lxo6aqk,2024-11-17 18:28:57,I definitely would have offer sheeted Necas instead of signing Tarasenko but that's all water under the bridge now.
detroitredwings,lxnblhn,2024-11-17 15:39:11,I saw it on puckpedia reported as an upper body injury and expected back for tomorrow
detroitredwings,lxn787v,2024-11-17 15:15:36,I saw that in the Reddit but I didn't actually hear the broadcasters say he was/wasn't hurt
detroitredwings,lxo5wyl,2024-11-17 18:26:42,I don't think we could ever say that honestly
detroitredwings,lxmwvbt,2024-11-17 14:19:23,I don't think a coaching change would make us a lock for the playoffs. I'm more concerned with the mentality in the locker room and development of our players. It looks like no one cares to play any more.
detroitredwings,lxnpefu,2024-11-17 16:53:05,I start to give coaches slack (from a how good are they perspective) if they've been coaching a team for more than 1.5 seasons. Especially on teams that aren't built to be contenders.On that same note I'm not a fan of all the people putting down Lalonde saying he can't motivate a team after what we saw last year. It can be possible for Lalonde to not be an effective coach for the Red Wings at this point and also be true that he's a perfectly fine coach. Jay Woodcroft only made it a  year. :P
detroitredwings,lxlvh03,2024-11-17 10:56:34,Got it! It was champagne athletics in case anyone was curious
detroitredwings,lxmonh7,2024-11-17 13:36:42,YouTube TV does not have Fanduel Sports Network. So no it will not fit your case. I use YouTube TV and a direct sub to FDSN been considering looking into a more one stop solution but haven’t seen anything cheaper as a whole
detroitredwings,lxn61v5,2024-11-17 15:09:13,Fubo says they have FDSN included at their $80 tier.
detroitredwings,lxmvd8n,2024-11-17 14:11:30,Nice to see that he's back from Player's Assistance.Curious if he plays for the Walleye.There's no way Cossa is the 3rd goalie in GR.
detroitredwings,lxmv533,2024-11-17 14:10:19,Wow huge move
detroitredwings,lxo6eck,2024-11-17 18:29:33,https://preview.redd.it/4jqg8strqj1e1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5daa5ed99e187011af834e78f8f8b312b1c45506
detroitredwings,lxnyojt,2024-11-17 17:44:47,Don’t disagree. But it also drives home for me how much more difficult it is to turn around a team in the  NHL than it is in the NFL.
detroitredwings,lxno3a0,2024-11-17 16:45:53,i think he's coming to a deep realization
detroitredwings,lxo6avi,2024-11-17 18:28:58,I agree with your general point but we did have to pay a 2nd and 4th to clear space this summer largely because of those bloated contracts
detroitredwings,lxoe2uj,2024-11-17 19:14:23,You're signing guys for 4 and 5 year deals for bad money just to wait for the real guys. No man.
detroitredwings,lxo1wde,2024-11-17 18:03:11,There's also a problem with role and deployment.  Copp was a two way buzzsaw in his years in WPG like a better scoring version of Helm.  I don't know why a guy like that ends up used as a passive shutdown center.
detroitredwings,lxoyr3d,2024-11-17 21:18:49,"Would you really call what is going on a ""semi-good environment"" with these guys? The team seems miserable and these guys don't seem to be stepping up. The one guy that did left last year to join an up and coming division foe."
detroitredwings,lxp9pwy,2024-11-17 22:28:19,Argument has always been about progressionThe process is working. The Yzerplan is on track blah blah blah yadda yadda yaddaNow comes the Yzerfans defending the regression not hyping the progression.So it's all Hollands fault right?How many years does Steve get anyway?8...9....an entire decade?Because with all those guys you just mentioned we aren't making the playoffs next year either.
detroitredwings,lxq7do8,2024-11-18 03:19:11,Amount of copium in this comment lol
detroitredwings,lxp1e0n,2024-11-17 21:35:15,Our PP is currently performing better than it did last year. You'll be downvoted simply for a bad take. This team is not a Jake Walman away from being good. The PDO argument is valid no doubt but a coach who seems unable to get these guys to raise their game in a pivotal season isn't a minuscule part. Again it's not just 15 games this season; it's going back to the Florida game back in March of last season. We're talking like 30+ games of this team being in a funk when it matters most. This coach doesn't seem to have an answer.
detroitredwings,lxp4h9e,2024-11-17 21:54:21,This team is arguably better minus the 2nd pair D. Forwards are the same or better + goalies are better. Fire Lalonde and get a 2nd pair d and this season can still be saved without a doubt in my mind. Depends if yzerman has the balls to do what is necessary
detroitredwings,lxpu3q8,2024-11-18 01:03:32,I knew my animosity towards Cleary would be rekindled just not so soon.
detroitredwings,lxmzbao,2024-11-17 14:32:29,There’s a Shel Silverstein song with a very good piece of advice that I’m going to pass on“Beware of being the roller when there’s nothing left to roll”
detroitredwings,lxmwonl,2024-11-17 14:18:24,Would you be my adopted son?
detroitredwings,lxmfsdh,2024-11-17 12:49:10,Past 3 years? He's coached the team for two seasons.
detroitredwings,lxmcngo,2024-11-17 12:31:45,The team is definitely different than when Holland was GM but it's hard to say that it's better or any closer to a Cup
detroitredwings,lxml2yf,2024-11-17 13:17:55,The rebuild has loooong started. Whether it's working is in question but things are in a dramatically different place than they were pre-Yzerman even early Yzerman. Very much so.
detroitredwings,lxsrv0t,2024-11-18 13:55:00,We lost Simon. Gonna be a tough battle
detroitredwings,lxnkhim,2024-11-17 16:26:11,Ditto but I don’t think they are ready for Anthony Richardson. 
detroitredwings,lxog2g3,2024-11-17 19:25:36,I don’t think you have to worry about that too much…. Because they’re hanging 60 on the board next week.
detroitredwings,lxny82i,2024-11-17 17:42:09,Isn't he on IR?
detroitredwings,lxmm1fi,2024-11-17 13:23:02,"I spoke about this a little bit yesterday in hindsight it looks like Yzerman ""made a move"" so to speak when he hired Lalonde but if Jeff walked and didnt want to be back it doesnt look like Yzerman ""made a move"" as much anymore in my opinion. He just took someone in to continue with what Blashill had already started or was doing.It would be different if he had gone after a Peter DeBoer type of coach that would signal to me that he is going for something.But he basically hired a stopgap in my opinion."
detroitredwings,lxn15r1,2024-11-17 14:42:26,>I don't understand why any assistant coach would be slotted directly into an NHL head coaching position. IMO get them down to the AHL and give them a year or two just like we do with players.  If the Griffins head coach is doing a bang-up job then bring him up and put Lalonde on waivers.He was literally a head coach in the AHL (Iowa) for three years before coming to the NHL to be an AC in Tampa...You don't have to like him but at least Google before you fling hot takes
detroitredwings,lxn5ame,2024-11-17 15:05:05,He was qualified from a resume stand point. The thing is was he the best coach for the team or just the guy Yzerman wanted.
detroitredwings,lxmznp1,2024-11-17 14:34:17,Well…95%
detroitredwings,lxlmc50,2024-11-17 10:03:02,That season had no expectations and a roster much worse than this one. It was easier to shrug off the losses then.
detroitredwings,lxlm94g,2024-11-17 10:02:31,Well there's a difference between expecting to be terrible and expecting to be competitive for a playoff spot.  You just kinda accept awfulness and run with it and good performances are a pleasant surprise (sauce: am Lions fan).  Last season got a bunch of us feeling optimistic about our team finally turning the corner Lions-style (man that still feels weird to say) and instead we've taken a pretty dramatic step back.  I'm back to feeling surprised when we win instead of feeling like we're never out of games and that feels like we've all been faked out of what seemed like tangible progress on the rebuild.
detroitredwings,lxlmtgs,2024-11-17 10:05:54,Lol you think we picked up most of our fans in the seasons after? Have you watched the team since then?Get a grip
detroitredwings,lxlqkmb,2024-11-17 10:28:17,Oh gate keeping? Leave then.
detroitredwings,lxlm34d,2024-11-17 10:01:31,I miss those days for this sub. So many of us have stuck around yet diluted by the idiocrasy
detroitredwings,lxm6f60,2024-11-17 11:57:06,Username checks out!
detroitredwings,lxohv2t,2024-11-17 19:35:51,Hypothetical Larkin trades are fun. Teams missing centers would line up for him. I'm sure Dylan will love Salt Lake City or Seattle.
detroitredwings,lxqor8n,2024-11-18 06:28:29,"It's genuinely felt like we are on the Yzerplan track. Everything seems to coalesce around the 25-26 season with several contracts coming off the books. We're projected to shed $13+ millions and our prospects were estimated to start entering the team this year and next.Lyon and Husso will be replaced by Cossa in tandem with Talbot.Petry will make room for ASP.Motte Kane and Fischer can be replaced by several GR up and comers but probably Mazur and Danielsson. By the time Copp's contract runs out Lombardi and MBN will be fighting for a roster spot. It really depends on what position the rookies can play.I personally saw last season as a ""fuck it we may as well *try* to go to the playoffs"" and then this off season felt more like prepping a throwaway season where so many of our hot pieces were replaced with historically not so hot pieces. A stealth tank if you will for one last crack at the lottery before our future players starts rolling into the league.Like look at the players that were removed and what expectations you could possibly have for their replacements. Fire Wally and bring in Gustafsson... So we lose out in both offense and defense overall. Fire Ghost bring up a rookie defensive Johansson... So we lose offense but gain valuable experience for the future on a potential high-ceiling D man. Remove Maatta a well established third pair so we can fit Edvinsson for valuable experience.Like everything seems purposefully done to get our future players experience but tank the team overall because our ""real"" playoff team will arrive then.Of course I could be totally wrong but it's hard to imagine Larkin would even entertain the idea for another couple of years"
detroitredwings,lxo6522,2024-11-17 18:28:02,Toronto would never give up that for Larkin. Cowen is very promising knies is really developing into a great power forward. They could use a 3 C however
detroitredwings,lxo9ph9,2024-11-17 18:49:00,If we get to Thanksgiving and things haven't turned around it might be time to go full Trotz. Open call to make an offer on any current player not named Mo Ray Ed Cam or Marco. All serious offers will be entertained. 
detroitredwings,lxp3cls,2024-11-17 21:47:18,Free Dylan Larkin
detroitredwings,lxplcfy,2024-11-17 23:50:08,The real question is would Dylan want to play for any other team?
detroitredwings,lxosjr7,2024-11-17 20:40:33,With respect fuck off whining about your back to back Superb Owl champs being 9-1 after a loss to Buffalo Now is not the time nor place in this sub full of despairE: for people not reading the op comment the same as me I think it was tongue in cheek about the chiefs loss and not a serious complaint.
detroitredwings,lxon3i4,2024-11-17 20:07:09,At least Lalonde's football team managed to win a game to a superior opponent.Maybe he'll learn something.Probably not though
detroitredwings,lxle8uc,2024-11-17 09:10:14,Fuck Jamie Benn
detroitredwings,lxljm3u,2024-11-17 09:46:04,“Hey Larkin remember this toolbar that broke your neck and caused you to spend an entire offseason in a brace? Yeah we signed him aren’t you excited?!”No thanks
detroitredwings,lxljpd7,2024-11-17 09:46:39,Trolling much?
detroitredwings,lxm6dad,2024-11-17 11:56:48,We'd be fools to not offer him 7 x $7 million.  I like you in the depths of all this weirdness today you played the perfect card to get people riled up.
detroitredwings,lxlk1a1,2024-11-17 09:48:44,If he's cheap they'll consider it
detroitredwings,lxmnsm5,2024-11-17 13:32:17,He never lost with Columbus!
detroitredwings,lxmpshu,2024-11-17 13:42:32,He could make Kasper write out a list of the top 3 and bottom 3 hard workers on the team and then expose the list to the whole team.  If that doesn't light a fire under some asses I don't know what will.
detroitredwings,lxmn4zw,2024-11-17 13:28:53,I know right
detroitredwings,lxnisgu,2024-11-17 16:16:51,Thank you! I am very happy with the way it's turning out
detroitredwings,lxo8br1,2024-11-17 18:40:57,And ginger ales! Gotta figure out if I can mount a TV somewhere nearby for watching games too.Thanks!
detroitredwings,lxncyhk,2024-11-17 15:46:21,And I'll exclusively use lines that are suggested here.
detroitredwings,lxnibhp,2024-11-17 16:14:18,The man plays every down like it is a 0-0 game.  
detroitredwings,lxlls71,2024-11-17 09:59:39,Nah the curse of six oa probably.This team isn’t getting anywhere close to PO and thus not in the teens.
detroitredwings,lxl3oxj,2024-11-17 07:51:32,I get not wanting to break up the 1st line but Copp neuters any line he is on offensively and Compher isn't a 2nd line center.Kasper or Danielson HAVE to be our 2nd line center one of them does and the sooner the better. If Raymond can't live without Larkin we are in trouble anyway.
detroitredwings,lxltzp1,2024-11-17 10:48:04,First line really hasn't been performing tho their 5v5 has looked abyssal.
detroitredwings,lxl86mp,2024-11-17 08:26:37,April.I hear the guys are already planning their annual golf vacations
detroitredwings,lxlappw,2024-11-17 08:45:09,Yeah that's why I threw in 1 or fewer.I could have done 2 or fewer but I didn't want to inflate the stat We've done a decent job playing spoiler while not being competitive at all in said games
detroitredwings,lxmc0nb,2024-11-17 12:28:14,Fire Sale! 
detroitredwings,lxnjj6c,2024-11-17 16:20:58,That was the biggest loss in Jaguars history. That's a high bar.
detroitredwings,lxlgv66,2024-11-17 09:28:04,We've been down before but this season is different.We had no quit last year.Even if we were down we played hard and had a ton of comeback victories.Now after the 3rd goal is scored it's time to pack it in and skate around for 30 minutesThis team is fundamentally broken and it's miserable to watch.
detroitredwings,lxmiwq0,2024-11-17 13:06:14,Right!? It’s at least an attempt to show your team you’re still in it. Last night there was a minute and a half left down by two and Gru had already accepted the loss. I feel that shit energy as a fan I can only imagine how it is in the locker room.
detroitredwings,lxljjdm,2024-11-17 09:45:34,Actually I think we were in a playoff spot the last two seasons at Thanksgiving and didn't make it.This season is a disaster as in rebuild stagnating disaster and as someone else pointed out with all.those bad contracts won't end anytime soon.We aren't making the playoffs next year either.
detroitredwings,lxlfptj,2024-11-17 09:20:22,They were an actual good team though.
detroitredwings,lxlk5rk,2024-11-17 09:49:33,Yeah but if your hoping for the once in a 100 year outlier to happen you're screwed.
detroitredwings,lxmkjpc,2024-11-17 13:15:05,I think you can trade in ten unused timeouts for one  hot and ready. He's almost there.
detroitredwings,lxo1lkx,2024-11-17 18:01:29,Well that didnt look like much? He didnt even look to the bench when he did what-ever it is he did.
detroitredwings,lxljfja,2024-11-17 09:44:53,You got me there lol
detroitredwings,lxlx4tf,2024-11-17 11:05:58,I keep going back to losing Perron as well. He was frustrating at times but always seemed to show some heart and fight. We should have kept Perron and Ghost even if it meant staying about same last year. Re-signing Kane and then signing Tarasenko sure hasnt panned out.
detroitredwings,lxmo02r,2024-11-17 13:33:23,Thats really all Perron was though a voice in the locker room.   And if anything thats further proof that a coaching change is needed if what this team is missing is a voice in the locker room.   It's not like the one they've currently got is working.
detroitredwings,lxmmi8u,2024-11-17 13:25:31,I'd rather have a new voice.
detroitredwings,lxmqilg,2024-11-17 13:46:17,I've never been a fan of simply promoting the assistant when a coach is fired. Different situation when Dave Lewis took over but in general it seems uninspiring to me.
detroitredwings,lxmtuza,2024-11-17 14:03:41,I think Watson is fine with where he is. As I recall he turned down promotion offers previously to stay with the Walleye and was actually commuting from Cleveland to not uproot his family. In fact if I recall right his first year with the Griffins he still didn’t uproot his family but got an apartment to not avoid the commute. I’m not sure if the family has been moved yet or not but if they have I’m not sure he’d like moving again even for the prestige of an NHL job. He very much seems like a person that goes at his own pace and terms. (Though a NHL sized salary can have ways of swaying a person I’m sure.)
detroitredwings,lxmqqsw,2024-11-17 13:47:28,And Tampa Bay
detroitredwings,lxn7qai,2024-11-17 15:18:19,Larkin's a 2C anyway. His prime is not that important 
detroitredwings,lxmi5w0,2024-11-17 13:02:11,Is a -6 sub PPG #1 Center really a player we should mortage the future for? I'm sure he will do better once the calvary comes and he will get easier matchups while still being in his prime.
detroitredwings,lxmmtnc,2024-11-17 13:27:12,Pretty sure the last time he scored a goal was when he was 15 playing high school hockey. Absolutely unreal that he was a 2nd lolObviously you’re not drafting a defensive defenseman for their scoring but if you’re going to be in the NHL generally you’re good enough to get at least a few in junior/college lol
detroitredwings,lxmlowm,2024-11-17 13:21:10,I didn’t think so. Was a long shot when he was drafted. Seems like they drafted him for his frame hoping they could mold him into something useful.
detroitredwings,lxlbpjb,2024-11-17 08:52:20,This is the final year of petry Kane and husso’s contracts. And I reckon several of those other contracts will be off the books before next season.
detroitredwings,lxmnmjp,2024-11-17 13:31:23,In some fairness there’s more than a few guys out there missing the simple plays. I think some of it is coming down to usage like Seider being out there so much and in the hardest deployments and some is possibly the mental playmaking equivalent of gripping the stick too tight. Just trying to force something good to happen out there and flubbing things that normally wouldn’t be an issue.
detroitredwings,lxoxcgp,2024-11-17 21:10:07,Oh boy now I have to dig for mine no idea where that went
detroitredwings,lxol61j,2024-11-17 19:55:28,That rules.
detroitredwings,lxo93vt,2024-11-17 18:45:27,A big fat unit of a Zamboni.
detroitredwings,lxojhoh,2024-11-17 19:45:28,"Yeah it's dumb. I was actually referring to the fact that he had a ""perfect""/max QBR but either way they're a bit challenged."
detroitredwings,lxm8bdv,2024-11-17 12:07:35,In hindsight I would've really like to have kept Perron. $4M is a little steep for his on ice value however I think a vet like him who has won in this league was a good mentor for the younger players and seems like a dude who was all about passing the torch. Unfortunately we're up against the cap with all these other overpaid players who don't provide much value and can't be moved because of said poor value.
detroitredwings,lxmt357,2024-11-17 13:59:42,Yeah I just haven’t seen most people mention him while a fair amount are talking up Tanguay. Honestly either is a good option I’m sure and every head coach has to get a start somewhere
detroitredwings,lxm1rkn,2024-11-17 11:31:31,It would be hard to care when you’re not viewed as an equal to leading your team **as the fucking Captain** and embarrassed in front of your boys and GM. 
detroitredwings,lxls15h,2024-11-17 10:36:49,The problem is we are quite literally running Seider into the ground making him play ridiculous ice-time with tons of defensive zone starts. We may have permanently harmed his development as a 2-way D with our bullshit systems and roster construction. Even if Lalonde is helping our draft position with his ineptitude can we really afford to just throw away a season of Ray Seider and Ed as core developmental pieces?
detroitredwings,lxo351k,2024-11-17 18:10:24,Good thing we're such an old team.
detroitredwings,lxnevpi,2024-11-17 15:56:22,Seider and Raymond are centerpieces of our team and Edvinsson is looking like he’s going to be as good as Seider. If ASP hits and Ed continues on as he has been our defense is sorted. Doesn’t matter who we surround them with as long as they can actually play at the NHL level.Mazur will be on the team at some point this season and Johansson is already here both picked outside the first round. Wallinder Lombardi Buium and Buchnelikov are all probably playing games for the Red Wings in the future all picked outside the first round. Finnie looked like a beast in the preseason and he’s doing great in the WHL and we picked him in the seventh round! The fact that we’re even talking about the possibility of the seventh round pick making the NHL roster is incredible.So no I truly do not understand the criticisms of the amateur scouting team and I think the people who are whining about it seriously lack perspective. People aren’t just saying we have one of the best prospect pipelines for no reason.
detroitredwings,lxnfq53,2024-11-17 16:00:35,Amateur scouting under draper has seen us get seider Raymond edvinnson cossa first round in our first 3 years under him and all of those guys are or look like they can be top end guys. Less runway for the closer picks but ASP is a potential star kasper/Danielson/mbn at the very least look like potential top 6 forwards. A 100% hit rate in the first round is insane if the newer picks keep developing.You can argue with our philosophy especially in the mid/late rounds but as of right now we have buchelnikov who's one of the best forwards in the khl at 21 currently on pace for the 2nd best age 21 season ever augustine is the best goalie in the ncaa Lombardi is having a breakout season in the ahl mazur has looked like atleast a middle 6 winger with room for more wallinder has looked like a potential top 4 D finnie is crushing the whl as a 7th rounderAnd that's just the standouts which doesn't include guys who are doing well like buium kiiskinen Anton Johansson plante etc.We have a top 5 pool in the league despite having 3 top line/pair players graduate from our system the last few years. Shaking up our amateur drafting would be a giant mistake and I don't really think it's arguable
detroitredwings,lxo0ks5,2024-11-17 17:55:38,I don't see anything in AJo that says top 4 d. I'm all for playing him and giving him time but he isn't exactly running away with the job.
detroitredwings,lxnw5n8,2024-11-17 17:30:24,Yep. Something absolutely has to change. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity. Shots per game isn't the best measure in many situations. But we have been getting out shot and out chanced by a wide margin this season. Our players consistently do not show up on time and that is a trend that goes back to last season. They rarely ever show up for a full 60 minutes. I've been patient but the product that we have on the ice is terrible and an embarrassment for an original 6 team. I honestly don't see how LaLonde makes it past Thanksgiving.
detroitredwings,lxnk3z9,2024-11-17 16:24:06,Well for one thing I’m not gonna sit here drooling all over myself asking for Steve to hire Joel fucking Quenneville that’s for sure
detroitredwings,lxq70jb,2024-11-18 03:15:09,Our best player is drafted by him lol
detroitredwings,lxon3yc,2024-11-17 20:07:13,Steve’s picks haven’t exactly been home runs
detroitredwings,lxm1tm5,2024-11-17 11:31:50,I hear a time out murdered his family and he has severe PTSD about calling a time out
detroitredwings,lxm2184,2024-11-17 11:33:00,Between disconnects like that and the fact that they're not showing the coaching staff on the bench during the broadcast as much as before makes me wonder if some shit is going on there
detroitredwings,lxma4u1,2024-11-17 12:17:46,I just watched it again and he tells the guys on the ice with him to look up at the clock. He looks up again while skating to the bench and definitely motions for a timeout.As for how gloves fit you can usually readjust them with a quick wiggle of your hands. They're bulky and loose compared to basically any other kind of glove.
detroitredwings,lxld78d,2024-11-17 09:02:55,I doubt it. He’s lost his touch and is a black hole all over the ice. Slow won’t body check loses almost every battle
detroitredwings,lxlnmod,2024-11-17 10:10:48,He’s not being utilized correctly. It’s clear with the hip and his size he can’t/won’t go to hard areas. Needed to be paired with some guys that could go to hard areas and drive possession. Needs to be on a possession team. Instead we deploy a boring safe dump and chase style that requires high effort in hard areas to score greasy goals. None of that is Kaner.
detroitredwings,lxmqqnr,2024-11-17 13:47:27,Everyone's 5 v 5 play has deteriorated its not just Kane.   Besides the style of hockey we're trying to play is the antithesis of Kane's natural game.   Whoever sold him reasons to stay in Detroit really fucking mugged him because I dont feel they've been honest with him.   There's no way he would have chosen to stay if he knew he was going to be playing this shit show style of hockey.   They probably told him it was going to be more of last season.
detroitredwings,lxmqexw,2024-11-17 13:45:46,He totally can we know how much of a cheapskate he can be though
detroitredwings,lxncgdb,2024-11-17 15:43:47,I think if that was true we would have seen different messaging from management and would have seen a push for any of the bigger fish in free agency the last couple of years. Larkin cat Raymond seider are the only large and/or long contracts we've signed three of which are home grown. Cat is the only actual large move that involved giving up serious draft capital and he's a 26 year old former 40 goal scorer. If Steve had run out of patience we would 100% be trading away prospects for veteran help and or signing guys in their 30s to 7year contracts in free agency. I don't quite agree with you there. To me the moves and messaging suggest most moves have been stop gaps
detroitredwings,lxmxg2p,2024-11-17 14:22:24,It’s a good thing our roster isn’t taking up 100% of our cap space then eh?More seriously we aren’t a tanking team and we aren’t a poor team. I don’t care about saving Illitch money
detroitredwings,lxmvrwj,2024-11-17 14:13:37,It's starting to look like the Harrold Ballard school of ownership.Ice a barely competent team and make sure the arena is sold out every night. It literally doesn't matter if the team is actually good cause suckers will keep showing up to games if you string them along.I am in the list of suckers still going to games. We went to Buffalo and we're going to NYE
detroitredwings,lxo65uw,2024-11-17 18:28:09,It's been awhile.In the late 80's/ very early 90's the Lions were a playoff team and it was the Dead Wings era at the Joe
detroitredwings,lxmz2u3,2024-11-17 14:31:12,And if Steve feels Lalonde has lost the locker room then he should make the change. As fans we have no clue what is actually going on. And personally I think ability is often confused with effort and vice versa. Last night was certainly a stinker though that’s for sureAlso player development is a pro of Lalonde our young guys have done well if you don’t overrate depth guys like AlJo. This sub is in for a bad realization if Yzerman decides to go with someone like GallantPeople read into various sentences in pressers or Larkin wanting a timeout last night and make a lot of assumptions. Do people think Yzerman just doesn’t notice or is unaware of the current team mentality?
detroitredwings,lxn1epk,2024-11-17 14:43:49,Bummer. Thanks!
detroitredwings,lxmvbnd,2024-11-17 14:11:16,The move we've been waiting for! 
detroitredwings,lxmyvar,2024-11-17 14:30:05,It just means he is out of the assistance program and they’re about to assign him to a minor team rather than keep him in the NHL. It’s just a move no reason to be sardonic about it. Or would you rather he slot into the goalie rotation?
detroitredwings,lxntcqt,2024-11-17 17:14:52,Today an NHL GM on cannabis realized that all players are merely humans dancing on the ice like a slow gyration that they are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively there is no such thing as offense the game is only a dream and the players are the imagination of themselves. Here's Newsy LaLonde with the Weather.
detroitredwings,lxo8u8a,2024-11-17 18:43:54,You're not wrong. Mistakes have been made. We're also not privy to all the information in particular the Walman situation. Something clearly happened that made Yzerman act fairly rashly.  The Kiiskinen/Gibson trade did soften the blow.  Regardless it hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows but I do like the overall direction I'm seeing for the future.
detroitredwings,lxojqgw,2024-11-17 19:46:55,Yep. Eventually the signings we make in free agency will matter and might even make or break our ability to be a playoff contender. This little practice run hasn’t exactly instilled a ton of confidence.
detroitredwings,lxo65tn,2024-11-17 18:28:09,He lost foot speed after his core surgeryHe also was given a whole season as the 2C here as well and has played multiple roles this season alone
detroitredwings,lxpdbke,2024-11-17 22:52:45,Can easily buy one of them out next year if we have someone better to put in their place.
detroitredwings,lxq07zi,2024-11-18 02:02:37,I understand the argument for pp but ghost did more than just be a pp qb he also was a good offensive contributor 5v5 and gave secondary scoring lines a competent offensive player to generate offence with and eye test is not pretty for seider QB’ing and a lot of r inflated GX on the PP can be attributed to seider not getting that many touches Bad take my ass read a book
detroitredwings,lxp7ipb,2024-11-17 22:13:55,Couldn’t agree more. Our F group is just as good if not better and same with our G. We need a D that can carry Ben Chariot as a 2nd pairing and take up minutes on the PK. That’s where Yzerman F’d up this offseason. Don’t sign Gus give an extra mil or 2 to a sound D on a short term deal.
detroitredwings,lxqt04s,2024-11-18 07:06:54,There is no fixing the 2nd unit d in season. No cap space for it. That’s an offseason fix as long as Lalonde has the locker room I think he keeps the job. That being said Kane doesn’t seem happy with the system and that Larkin timeout thing didn’t look pretty. A couple more rough games and he could easily lose the players if he hasn’t already.
detroitredwings,lxo61pk,2024-11-17 18:27:29,It feels so much longer though
detroitredwings,lxtjjlh,2024-11-18 16:14:44,Do we know how long he's out for yet?
detroitredwings,lxnycw1,2024-11-17 17:42:55,Nope he's back and got an assist his first game back
detroitredwings,lxmnf3e,2024-11-17 13:30:20,I always figured Lalonde would get us to the playoffs but he's not the guy to get us a Cup. Now I wonder if he'll even manage playoffs
detroitredwings,lxmq76u,2024-11-17 13:44:38,A stopgap with the ability to forge his own destiny essentially is what happened.
detroitredwings,lxn30b7,2024-11-17 14:52:34,I think they meant Tanguay who funnily was also an assistant coach for the Iowa Wild for a time (Post Lalonde)
detroitredwings,lxn8j9o,2024-11-17 15:22:37,good point. I guess success in the AHL isn't a good indicator then. my bad.  We should still send him back down.
detroitredwings,lxn07x7,2024-11-17 14:37:17,Give me 0.5% of our cap and the standard Red Wings training regimen and I'll do at least as much as Jeff Petry
detroitredwings,lxmn7br,2024-11-17 13:29:14,Bingo.
detroitredwings,lxluko8,2024-11-17 10:51:23,"Not gonna argue about what/if gatekeeping is happening here but it's no secret that the vast majority of social media has been significantly diluted in the past 4-5 years. This sub is no exception.And taken in context it's no outlier. Volume is up so trash takes are to be expected as much as ever. But there's also still some wonderful clientele here and great conversations. I follow gameday/in-game threads for a few different sports teams in very different walks of life and the most consistent thing across all of them are laughably over-reactive takes every second of every play. Wild swings in emotion and sentiment. High amounts of myopic and diluted angst. Etc. It's no surprise since this is really what the purveyors of most social media platforms benefit from having: frustrated engagement outlets and ""them vs us"" polarization on nearly every topic. Someone always has to win..someone has to be fired. Someone has to be the idiot. Someone gotta be louder. Momentum over understanding. Arguing over empathizing. A few decades ago sports were more often than not an outlet of human emotion. Now they're just a reflection of it."
detroitredwings,lxlswdi,2024-11-17 10:41:47,At least we expected to suck back then. It was fun watching Larkin and Hronek and Bert and Mantha and AA. I cheered my heart out for that team. This team is just literally poopy
detroitredwings,lxm9h3l,2024-11-17 12:14:03,A lot of people were nicer back then
detroitredwings,lxm6iu0,2024-11-17 11:57:40,Bring back Babs
detroitredwings,lxoa5b0,2024-11-17 18:51:33,Treliving maybe not but if it was Dubas leafs yeah probably. Larkin could easily be a super dependable 2/3 center or winger for them with top line fill in. And honestly if it meant a cup Knies and Cowan are a small price to pay The bigger issue for the leafs would be as always cap. Even at 50% retained Larkin would push them over.
detroitredwings,lxpit0y,2024-11-17 23:31:46,I mean plan A is get a serious coach and ice a competent rosterPlan B is free Dylan if we're absolutely shackled to the idea of not making the playoffs for another 5-7 years
detroitredwings,lxoxait,2024-11-17 21:09:47,3 Super Bowl wins in 5 years and they’re crying about their 9-1 Chiefs. Talk about bitching for the sake of bitching.
detroitredwings,lxon940,2024-11-17 20:08:07,Maybe he'll be in a good mood and take a chance on some rational line combinations
detroitredwings,lxlh8nl,2024-11-17 09:30:36,Fuck Jamie Benn
detroitredwings,lxlq86m,2024-11-17 10:26:15,I mean we kept signing guys that fucked up Mantha so there's precedent lol
detroitredwings,lxm81ei,2024-11-17 12:06:03,We like to have fun around here :)
detroitredwings,lxmseev,2024-11-17 13:56:09,He did however speedrun losing the room. Put that shit in the Guinness book of records
detroitredwings,lxmq6z1,2024-11-17 13:44:36,Don't forget about making everyone turn in their phones so Babs can look at their private texts and pictures.
detroitredwings,lxo4q0r,2024-11-17 18:19:46,Rasmussen Kane Petry
detroitredwings,lxnriwz,2024-11-17 17:04:45,Man if only we could play like that.
detroitredwings,lxl4ek3,2024-11-17 07:57:25,More or  less Kasper shares the center duties with Compher and eventually takes the reigns.Not sure he's ready to play 2C for the next 60+ games quite yet.Hate to say it but it is what it is on the 3rd line we don't have the depth to have a better option than Copp.
detroitredwings,lxlm3a0,2024-11-17 10:01:32,Who's gonna be the future 1C?
detroitredwings,lxmh6tf,2024-11-17 12:56:50,![gif](giphy|tMOyj4hkcxSfe)
detroitredwings,lxmfyyf,2024-11-17 12:50:10,..and we were led by the spirits of a griddy Perron ...
detroitredwings,lxmn4vr,2024-11-17 13:28:52,I see the timeout as an opportunity to reset whatever is happening. If you give up two or three quick goals the guys obviously need a second to collect themselves. The SJ game last season is the most glaring example. 4 goals and they never could recover ultimately missing the playoffs by a single point that they may have collected had the guys taken a moment to breathe and reset after the second or even third goal. But nope just keep rolling the lines like nothing has happened.
detroitredwings,lxljpwd,2024-11-17 09:46:45,Yeah that's what I was trying to say
detroitredwings,lxljdym,2024-11-17 09:44:37,"A lot of people are saying we are a good team also on paper and that the second we fire Lalonde we will be a cup contender i dont agree but there are so many in here who goes ""TARASENKO???!?! SUPERSTAR?!?! KANE??? SUPERSTAR!!""There are a lot of solid names on the roster who very long time ago was something"
detroitredwings,lxltk5b,2024-11-17 10:45:33,"This is what he said that i responded to>I’m still constantly saying it’s still pretty early but sooner than later it won’t be early anymore.Too me ""wont be early anymore"" is January.I know that the general consensus is thanksgiving."
detroitredwings,lxo4e6c,2024-11-17 18:17:49,That’s kind of what I was leaning towards. On one hand I can see what appears to be the “timeout” hand gesture but on the other hand it looks like he could’ve just been pumped up and clapping at his team to get going.
detroitredwings,lxn3egb,2024-11-17 14:54:41,Perron's skating fell off badly last year to the point that guys just skated away from him and he'd be out of the play in a few steps.  Once that happens to a guy in his mid to late 30s it's usually time to move on.
detroitredwings,lxn2obm,2024-11-17 14:50:46,With most of the available candidates being well traveled members of the NHL's old boy's club I don't think a McClellan Q or Gallant would actually accomplish that.  To varying degrees they all seem to chase what made them successful years ago.  And at that point we're just exchanging one inflexible tactician for another.
detroitredwings,lxmvtjm,2024-11-17 14:13:51,Personally I would've gone with Barry Smith as Bowman's replacement but Lewis probably would've been better off taking a head coaching job anywhere else and had a longer run.  In another situation without a cup or bust goalpost and fewer Hull/Hasek/Cujo/Shanny egos to manage he probably wpuld've been a lot more successful.
detroitredwings,lxn82d7,2024-11-17 15:20:10,Well unless you think we're going to sign a superstar in the near future he's our 1C. Maybe by the time he's in his mid-thirties he'll be at 2C but what happens in the years between? Are you imagining just season after season of mediocrity?
detroitredwings,lxmibtb,2024-11-17 13:03:04,Oh cool now we have people here doubting Larkin? Thought we got over this last season.
detroitredwings,lxmredb,2024-11-17 13:50:55,One of the biggest wastes of a 2nd round pick I can ever recall.
detroitredwings,lxmqve2,2024-11-17 13:48:08,Gambling on a long shot third pairing defenseman in the 2nd is one of Draper's stranger decisions.
detroitredwings,lxmgmkt,2024-11-17 12:53:45,OMG... I didn't see that these yahoos are here for another year!!!!  Unbearable. Starting to think SY is the first number on GM's speed dials..
detroitredwings,lxoa94b,2024-11-17 18:52:12,I can give you 30 CCs of gravy take it or leave it
detroitredwings,lxoata1,2024-11-17 18:55:28,I thought you were trying to bribe one of us into going to the Turkey Day game so you could get the sweet Zamboni boat without having to watch them play.  /s  
detroitredwings,lxmtddg,2024-11-17 14:01:10,I think his stock dropped now that our PK is dog shit and our overall defense is questionable at best.
detroitredwings,lxlwjei,2024-11-17 11:02:39,Mo doesn’t have ridiculous ice time at all for a 1 D he’s 18th in the league. He does play the hardest minutes but I think it’s alarmist to wonder if that has permanently harmed him. He will also play extremely hard minutes with any coach since we legitimately might have the worst 3-7 defenseman as a whole in the league
detroitredwings,lxlsa7c,2024-11-17 10:38:15,Like I said I don't agree with it but I can see what Steve is going for.I think it's a mistake to keep Lalonde around and we need to make a trade yesterday that can ease the deployment of Seider.
detroitredwings,lxlwt4n,2024-11-17 11:04:10,> The problem is we are quite literally running Seider into the groundOh cmon now there is no indication that this current situation is harming Seider in any way.Larkin played on some of the worst rosters in team history and he is doing just fine having a career year last year. Jack Eichel/Sam Reinhart played on some really fucked up Buffalo teams and they are both having a career year.
detroitredwings,lxnibu5,2024-11-17 16:14:22,I don't think Mo or Lucas are really top-end guys yet. They've both had great breakout seasons at one time or another but I don't think either sniffs an All-Star team. They might need better coaching to get there.
detroitredwings,lxnlkru,2024-11-17 16:32:07,so no answer. i guess you like lalonde?
detroitredwings,lxonn38,2024-11-17 20:10:30,At least at this point there aren't any glaring misses.It's far too early to tell.Raymond and Seider definitely look like the best picks available.I can see Kasper Danielson and MBN being questionable but it'll take a few more years. Not everyone has linear development.Laf looked like a bust but with the right coach and deployment he's starting to look like the player the Rangers drafted.
detroitredwings,lxmeq4t,2024-11-17 12:43:15,That’s about what I figured. Like I said that was the optimistic side of me.
detroitredwings,lxll7uj,2024-11-17 09:56:10,Last year we had more depth up front and could work around his deficiencies. This year we can't and it shows. He doesn't look nearly the player he was last year and I hope he decides to leave and chase a final cup.  I really hope we don't sign him again next year.
detroitredwings,lxlpns4,2024-11-17 10:22:56,He can be a net benefit to a team with sheltered 5v5 minutes  with a PP merchant role. If you're expecting Kane to bring speed and physicality then idk what to tell ya
detroitredwings,lxmpubk,2024-11-17 13:42:48,Nah he's just a bad fit for the shit show style hockey we're trying to play.   It calls for defensive 200ft players.   Kane looks bad because the system is a bad fit for him not because he's done.   He'll get a trade if he can find the right team.
detroitredwings,lxlqj4b,2024-11-17 10:28:02,That's why I think Kasper needs to be with Kane.Kasper is a tenacious little fucker and would do well in that role.Kane Compher Kasper should be a regular line starting next game
detroitredwings,lxnmrwu,2024-11-17 16:38:41,Cat aint 26 and you dont singn 3+ year contracts for stop gaps.
detroitredwings,lxmwqzc,2024-11-17 14:18:45,This is bs. During late Holland years and early Yzerman years we pretty much sold out every home game.
detroitredwings,lxo72fw,2024-11-17 18:33:34,The Dead Wings era was the Harkness under Darkness and pre-Demers era. The Lions were decent from 91-97 but the Wings were already on their way up by 93 (damn you Nikolai Borschevsky).
detroitredwings,lxnu2px,2024-11-17 17:18:54,"Yzerman: *Takes a too-strong edible**Frost spreads on the field starting on one side of the field and crystalizing towards the other.* *The football players mold into hockey before his very eyes.**Human by The Killers starts playing.*""Drapes are you seeing this shit?""*We all realize Kris Draper was just a figment of our imaginations.*"
detroitredwings,lxnym13,2024-11-17 17:44:23,Newsy:   Thanks Merk!   Okaaaay.   Here we have a warm front coming in from the east and that means there's gonna be a lot of looks out there.   We can expect to get plenty of bodies to the beach  and just some really good analytics there.   Out west I dont really love how its looking but trust the process plenty of sun screen  get the bodies out there should be fine.
detroitredwings,lxnx70y,2024-11-17 17:36:14,"""look at my furrows of worry"""
detroitredwings,lxnyf05,2024-11-17 17:43:16,Prying open his third eye
detroitredwings,lxog5tm,2024-11-17 19:26:08,That's what I mean.  Lalonde's gameplan holds our forwards back to defend constantly.  When Copp's playing a more aggressive game he's far more effective.
detroitredwings,lxqkpyd,2024-11-18 05:47:34,Ghost was terrible 5v5. It’s why Yzerman let him go. He was only valuable on the PP. And again the PP is better now than it was last season so Seider is doing better than Ghost. I’d love to have Ghost but your argument of his strongpoints is like that of an uncle on Facebook. Lol read a book is that the new “touch grass”  just give a better argument and you’ll be fine. It couldn’t be any easier or more popular to talk shit about this team right now and yet you somehow failed. Go back to the drawing board chief.
detroitredwings,lxqtql4,2024-11-18 07:13:08,Last year we had a bad defense yet could afford to scratch petry here or there and Holl barely saw the ice…this year we downgeaded ghost with Gus and are relying heavily on Holl and petry…that says a ton about how poor this years d is. Ed is an overall improvement over Walman but also an offensive downgrade. Petry and chariot as a 3rd pair would be alright if there was a “average” 2nd pair above them. AJo is a find 7th guy. But Holl petry and Gus need to go. Thankfully petry is on an expiring we can buy out Holl and then just eaive/demote gus in the offseason. 10-12 million in cap will open up. Invest every cent in that 2nd pair defense..
detroitredwings,lxtmuk7,2024-11-18 16:31:22,Somehow he might still play against SJ. We will see
detroitredwings,lxmsrmz,2024-11-17 13:58:03,> I always figured Lalonde would get us to the playoffsSo did you think hiring him would be what was needed to get us to the playoffs or that he would just be the one that would be here when we got there?
detroitredwings,lxmtkv2,2024-11-17 14:02:15,He is also brand new as a coach so he cant really set any demands on Yzerman in terms of what the team is going to look like and how far they will go. I can imagine if you hire someone more experienced that coach will not want to be a part of a long rebuild.Its why Jeff was a good fit also he knew Yzerman knew we all knew; And we all accepted it.
detroitredwings,lxnc7m7,2024-11-17 15:42:29,Idk seems from the response like it was lalonde. I read assistant (Lalonde in Tampa) slotted into NHL head coaching role (lalonde in Detroit) as the criticism in question so pointed out that Lalonde was in Iowa for three years. Tanguay hasn't been a HC so i wasn't tracking that way. But happy to retract my statement if that was the intention.
detroitredwings,lxniep2,2024-11-17 16:14:48,I mean there are tons of factors. It's all good. He's probably got still some work to do himself. And he's not been given a lot of holes to cover up by Stevie. I mean Petry and Chiarot are legit bottom pair at best on ⅔ of the teams in the league. And we have the Motte/Veleno/Fischer/Ras conundrum of having four 4th line wingers when a team really should the more than 2 maybe 3 on a 23 man roster in our situation.
detroitredwings,lxn25zg,2024-11-17 14:47:58,Unfortunately that brings you below league minimum which is .88% of the cap. You’re gonna have to accept this counter offer or give up on your dreams of supplanting Jeff Petry(.5 works out to 440K)
detroitredwings,lxlxj7z,2024-11-17 11:08:11,>I follow gameday/in-game threads for a few different sports teams in very different walks of life and the most consistent thing across all of them are laughably over-reactive takes every second of every play. Wild swings in emotion and sentiment. High amounts of myopic and diluted angst. Etc. This has been the case for 8-10 + years in this sub. Or any sports/team subs. This isnt anything new.
detroitredwings,lxobact,2024-11-17 18:58:15,I'm sure we could figure something out if the price was right.Domi is making 3.5 and would be redundant.There's always the 3 way trade though not sure how much that would help
detroitredwings,lxoxuro,2024-11-17 21:13:17,I think it was more tongue in cheek complaining which is why I still upvoted but made my own whiny comment
detroitredwings,lxp0zvu,2024-11-17 21:32:48,People keep acting like their record matters. They were always going to make the playoffs. It's the way they get there that I care about. They're almost as frustrating to watch as the Wings. But at least the Wings don't have the best player in the league on their team.
detroitredwings,lxlru6y,2024-11-17 10:35:41,We signed guys that Mantha fought that’s a touch different from a dirty player cross checking someone’s neck
detroitredwings,lxmzsmh,2024-11-17 14:35:00,Also got the NHLPA to do something so that was kinda neat.Although that might have just been a new guy making sure everyone knew he meant business.
detroitredwings,lxl5i4s,2024-11-17 08:05:57,The problem with that 3rd line is that veterans are not held accountable on this team.All of the blame it gets for being old and slow and then lit the hell up will be leveled at Berggren and any remaining value in him will be gone.He has not been a defensive liability this season and is still trying to be creative offensively and he seems to be more eager to play the body.He doesn't deserve the blame he is going to get because Tarasenko is washed up and Copp was never good to begin with.
detroitredwings,lxlop6g,2024-11-17 10:17:14,After Larkin I have no idea.It won't be Kasper or Danielson though.
detroitredwings,lxm34oo,2024-11-17 11:39:01,>A lot of people are saying we are a good team also on paper and that the second we fire Lalonde we will be a cup contenderIf by “a lot” you mean “no one”.  I haven’t seen one person claim this team is a Cup contender.  You’re just trying to paint a picture that people complaining about Lalonde and the team’s results are being totally unreasonable.The most people (including me) have said is that this team has the potential to be competitive and compete for a playoff spot.  That’s not the equivalent of saying this team is a Cup contender not by a long shot.
detroitredwings,lxn3dbo,2024-11-17 14:54:31,I wouldn't mind seeing Sutter here.Calgary was pretty fucking solid under his tenure had high flying offense and solid goaltending.There were some high profile departures though I'm not sure that was completely related to the coach or just that some American players didn't want to live in the middle of nowhere Canada.I don't think the team collapsing was on Sutter but more on the GM not getting back a roster comparable to what he lost with Gaudreau (RIP) and Tatchuk
detroitredwings,lxnfzkk,2024-11-17 16:01:52,Apparently Smith was Bowman’s first choice to replace him as head coach.  But for whatever reason whether it was because Smith didn’t want the job or because the org preferred Lewis due to him being around for longer (and him being more of a player’s coach) Dave got the nod.I wonder how things would have turned out if Smith took over.
detroitredwings,lxo55v4,2024-11-17 18:22:20,You never want to be the guy after The Guy
detroitredwings,lxn9c7f,2024-11-17 15:26:55,Without a true 1C yes it will be mediocrity. This team needs elite level talent. I know it's hard when you can't draft it but it's the only way to win. Larkin is good but not elite
detroitredwings,lxmiujg,2024-11-17 13:05:53,I'm posting stats that are reality and then I'm being optimistic that he will do better once we have our defensive centers come. Freeing him up with easier matchups.I'm just saying Larkin isn't a nuclear weapon that makes your roster a contender just from his existence on the team.
detroitredwings,lxnkvvc,2024-11-17 16:28:21,And getting pretty good players in that range should be expected anyways. You always like to not miss but that’s the easiest part of the draft.
detroitredwings,lxnm49s,2024-11-17 16:35:07,Did you miss the part where I said I’m down for a coaching change to see if that shakes things up? It wasn’t a very long comment But I have no strong feelings toward Lalonde one way or another. I certainly don’t think that replacing him is going to be some cure all for this team like a lot of people have apparently convinced themselves.
detroitredwings,lxopxsk,2024-11-17 20:24:32,Also Kasper is on pace for 5 goals in his D+2. Just not good no matter how you cut it.
detroitredwings,lxops1u,2024-11-17 20:23:33,I used to agree on your assessment with Seider and Raymond but less so now. I think Boldey Caufield and Harley are now looking better than Seider while Sanderson and Jarvis look like better picks than Raymond.
detroitredwings,lxlmin8,2024-11-17 10:04:06,I doubt we’ll see a trade and I bet he’ll retire after the season tbh
detroitredwings,lxnq2hj,2024-11-17 16:56:42,You should probably do some base level research before you retort so matter of factly
detroitredwings,lxmx1am,2024-11-17 14:20:14,And the teams were awful. Fans are being sold on hope and not buying tickets based on results.Myself included of course
detroitredwings,lxo7pym,2024-11-17 18:37:25,Shit you're right.I half ass looked it up the last time we missed the playoffs was 89/90 and that's the year the drafted Sanders.The Wings have never been properly bad while the Lions were good.Maybe back in the 50's or something when the Lions were a juggernaut in the pre Superbowl era.

detroitredwings,lxqsq5m,2024-11-18 07:04:31,High n mighty white lightening! Just cause u say shit dosnt mean it has basis Ghost had a 2.5% positive GX 5on5 last year (as per moneypuck) Given his D partners and how we over preformed most things related to expected totals last year. I’d say that’s pretty good!Read a book
detroitredwings,lxtz766,2024-11-18 17:35:41,Holl only has one more year I’m sure he’ll play as a 6-7th D next year. Our D core is going to be great in 2-3 years will all those contracts gone and hopefully ASP as an offensive stud. Im optimistic it’s just bad right bow
detroitredwings,lxmt76b,2024-11-17 14:00:16,I figured it would be pure happenstance that he'd be here when the roster naturally progresses to the playoffs.I didn't think he was some game changer that was the final piece to the puzzle.After multiple first round exits we'd bring in a coach to get us over the top.
detroitredwings,lxnd7yl,2024-11-17 15:47:41,From their response to you I think you were correct. I was thinking it was in regards to bumping Tanguay to interim as he has never had a Head Coach position but has had assistant positions. They were just misinformed on Lalonde having the head coach position prior to being assistant in Tampa it seems. It’s always so difficult at times to gleen full context. Oh well
detroitredwings,lxlzjls,2024-11-17 11:19:21,I've been quite active on this sub for 10ish years now and you're wrong. There's always been some of what's being talked about but not nearly to the extent it is now. This sub was about 10x less negative during our historically bad 19-20 season Than it is now. There's a lot more people who seem to relish in the negativity 
detroitredwings,lxm2xth,2024-11-17 11:37:58,Sure to an extent but my point wasn't about the existence it was about the prevalence. It's inarguable that 8-10 year ago here and elsewhere there was more discussion in-game and that it was more nuanced and civil. Which makes sense bc there was more space for it. We used to have a few hundred comments or less per game thread..now we have many thousands. Much lIke the internet in general everyone's clamoring to get their views out in a cluttered world where differentiation is difficult.No one is saying hot takes are new it's that there's been quite pivot on how and why they manifest and how prevalence is increasing over time. That's definitely  been happening here. Acknowledging it isn't gatekeeping (not defending the origial commenters takes just stating in context) even though acknowledging probably does nothing to solve it since the accounts would be considered a part of the problem are unlikely to change behavior just from being called out.
detroitredwings,lxohbzl,2024-11-17 19:32:43,Domi slots in as a wing a lot so that’s a tad nonissue.
detroitredwings,lxls3hi,2024-11-17 10:37:10,Didn't we sign the guy that slewfoot Manta and broke his ribs?
detroitredwings,lxn110z,2024-11-17 14:41:43,Bit of both I think. New guy is a union strong Masshole (said lovingly here). I have little doubt he is willing to pull fingernails for the PA. Which may lead to things like lockouts but eh I’m union too. I support the players (millionaires) rights to stick it to owners (billionaires) on my behalf.
detroitredwings,lxl5v8h,2024-11-17 08:08:48,Ras Copp Fischer was successful last season.I think in a limited role with easier match ups Copp will do just fine.He's definitely not a 2nd line winger man wtf was Lalonde smoking?
detroitredwings,lxm2f68,2024-11-17 11:35:07,For the team to contend in the future they will need a better 1C. Be nice to draft one
detroitredwings,lxm50v2,2024-11-17 11:49:25,This is one of the most frustrating strawmans on this sub. No one with a brain thinks this team magically becomes a contender after Lalonde is gone its about whether or not he's getting the most or even the some out of this roster (he's not).
detroitredwings,lxm5ym0,2024-11-17 11:54:35,> to be competitive and compete for a playoff spotIf the only requirement is to compete for a playoff spot i think are we not there already? We are 4 points out from 3rd in our division isnt that good?
detroitredwings,lxmk3eq,2024-11-17 13:12:39,He's basically been right at a point per game the last few years while playing on mediocre or bad teams. He was on pace for 40 goals last season. If the current roster played to its potential he could b probably be a 90+ point player.
detroitredwings,lxnqkcb,2024-11-17 16:59:25,Seider and Raymond are arguably the second best players in their draft years what the fuck is wrong with some of the expectations in this sub
detroitredwings,lxnn1dv,2024-11-17 16:40:08,I give credit for making the correct picks but Stevie still needs to hit a home run somewhere whether it be draft trade or coach.
detroitredwings,lxnswti,2024-11-17 17:12:23,Exactly. A top 10 pick is supposed to hit
detroitredwings,lxnnska,2024-11-17 16:44:16,Give a name man. I just feel if you call out the sub you should provide an alternative.You'd go with Tanguay maybe?
detroitredwings,lxoty48,2024-11-17 20:49:11,5 goals for an 8th pick is disappointing no 2 ways about it. 
detroitredwings,lxot4oh,2024-11-17 20:44:08,I agree
detroitredwings,lxnsv0e,2024-11-17 17:12:06,And yet they'll wonder why they're downvoted and not taken seriously in the future.
detroitredwings,lxq8xls,2024-11-18 03:36:32,Ngl i tought he was born in 96 lol
detroitredwings,lxo8de0,2024-11-17 18:41:12,No worries. There's still a chance for the Wings to make a miracle run this year! Miracles happen occasionally.
detroitredwings,lxnxoil,2024-11-17 17:39:01,if only I had been born sooner
detroitredwings,lxmwqtu,2024-11-17 14:18:43,Yeah that sounds reasonable. I never envisioned much from Lalonde when we hired him it just felt very unrealistic to expect much more from him than from Jeff. I know he was assistant in Tampa and all that but that was a loaded roster and one of those cups came in the Covid years against Montreal...
detroitredwings,lxmpx6l,2024-11-17 13:43:12,Like others said before i rb there is different expectasions for this team now vs late Holland years/ early Yzerman years. That is the main difference.
detroitredwings,lxm04fx,2024-11-17 11:22:33,Jake Muzzin? No.
detroitredwings,lxlt0hy,2024-11-17 10:42:25,Maybe I don’t remember
detroitredwings,lxlj0f7,2024-11-17 09:42:12,I have no faith in Andrew Copp his ass should be stapled to the PK and the 4th line.If you have to depend on Andrew Copp for offense you are not a playoff team.
detroitredwings,lxmpulc,2024-11-17 13:42:50,A player that hinges on other players for production is just the point I'm trying to make that we shouldn't trade our top prospects for a short term solution. That's something that needed to happen last season if it was going to happen.
detroitredwings,lxnrqxf,2024-11-17 17:05:58,Of course we did very well with those picks (Seider in particular). My point was more that doing well in that part of the draft is the expectation as there should be more than one player at that spot who would be a good pick. The real success in drafting comes from hitting on picks outside of the lottery where players aren’t supposed to be impact guys.
detroitredwings,lxnt1fo,2024-11-17 17:13:05,Raymond better than Stutzle?
detroitredwings,lxno10a,2024-11-17 16:45:32,Seider won the Calder if that’s not a homerun what is?
detroitredwings,lxnoeaz,2024-11-17 16:47:34,I don’t know who I’d replace Newsy with and I think that makes the decision to fire him right now a difficult one for Steve.Of the people who are available I’d probably go with Bruce Boudreau.
detroitredwings,lxpmsfb,2024-11-18 00:01:08,Wow you two have finally found each other at last.
detroitredwings,lxny3g1,2024-11-17 17:41:25,I wish more people heard his message. It's more relevant today than ever.
detroitredwings,lxnjl6y,2024-11-17 16:21:16,I think you're missing the point. No one is saying the way we're playing is acceptable. The gap to expectations is a problem understandably.
detroitredwings,lxmumfq,2024-11-17 14:07:38,All good players have good players around them.
detroitredwings,lxop3i2,2024-11-17 20:19:22,Stutzle goes first in a redraft Raymond second
detroitredwings,lxnti34,2024-11-17 17:15:43,For sure both just behind the inarguable #1 of that draft Cam York.
detroitredwings,lxo08oo,2024-11-17 17:53:40,One of our very few lately.
detroitredwings,lxpv49x,2024-11-18 01:13:03,Seeing people talk to themselves on their burner accounts is such a beautiful thing.
detroitredwings,lxnzcd4,2024-11-17 17:48:34,Bill more than anyone is who I think of whenever it comes to dead folks offering up their take on current events.
detroitredwings,lxosqax,2024-11-17 20:41:40,I don't think so. Lafreniere is better than Raymond too
detroitredwings,lxovs38,2024-11-17 21:00:23,Nope don’t agree with that. Laf may be better someday but for now Raymond has shown that he’s the better player
detroitredwings,lxl7ubf,2024-11-17 08:24:03,The fact they get on average about 5 shot per period tells you everything. 
detroitredwings,lxktc2t,2024-11-17 06:10:49,Losing Ghost has hurt this team more than I thought he would. There’s no defenseman that can constantly bring the puck up.
detroitredwings,lxl123l,2024-11-17 07:28:38,Its the giveaway and the lack of concentration which drives me nuts.We probably conceded 10 goals this season alone because we give away the puck in situation which are suppose to be save plays.That weak attempt of an backhand pass by Raymond before the 1-0 is a prime example of that attitude.
detroitredwings,lxls5v6,2024-11-17 10:37:33,I must say I do find the Copp - Compher - Kane line to be odd.You've basically got one of the best passers in the game in Kane feeding nice outlet passes to players who cannot carry the puck towards the net. Meanwhile you've got Copp electing to dump the puck behind the net for Kane to go fetch which he can't due to his lack of speed.Would be nice to introduce some speed to that line at least.
detroitredwings,lxl32wm,2024-11-17 07:46:24,I have no problem with letting Lalonde go but Yzerman has to shoulder the blame too. He pro scouting has been horrible. He's trying to bridge the gap with below average vets that he can sign to short term contracts until the young guys are ready and it hasn't worked. On paper this team should be worse than last years and guess what it is! Too many swing and misses by our GM. I appreciate what Steve is trying to do building a team that will be competitive for the long haul. In order to do that you need smart drafting and get lucky with a few vets. The jury is still out on drafting  the veteran signing are terrible.
detroitredwings,lxmeocy,2024-11-17 12:42:58,Lalonde has to go.Last night when he snubbed his team’s captain one the only few guys still trying he basically said fuck you we’re not equals on running this team. It’s now obvious that’s part of the problem in the room if he’s comfortable doing it *during a fucking game*. It’s also incredibly disappointing that Steve as a player and captain watched that and didn’t fly down to the bench to relieve that bald retard himself. 
detroitredwings,lxkvtvc,2024-11-17 06:37:37,Listen I'm with ya that I don't love him. He's definitely contributing to the problems. Those problems though are built  into the roster and that's the real issue. I mean who looks at our blueline last season sees how bad it is and the solution is two rookies and trading your second best defender and letting your leading scorer walk. It's bananas.
detroitredwings,lxm9rjg,2024-11-17 12:15:42,A good coach adapts their system to meet the players halfway. This guy seems like he's forcing the players to adapt while refusing to play to anyone's strengths. It feels like he actively tells them to stop shooting stop looking to break out of the neutral zone stop worrying about possession and treat 5v5 as a PK.To top it off it's just fucking boring to watch. As a fan that definitely matters too.
detroitredwings,lxl0x4v,2024-11-17 07:27:22,"Agree with the part about Lalonde not being a great coach. Don't like the system don't think it plays to our guys strengths and instead aims to cover up weaknesses as much as possible which is no way to win games or enable your team. They do look flat too often. Have to disagree with virtually everything else about this post.What players are having ""down years""? Larkin is on pace to score 50. Raymond is a point per game. Seider/Ed are dominating in the toughest minutes in the league. Debrincat is on pace to score 40 and is tied with Raymond for the scoring lead. Seider hasn't regressed he's been mostly excellent.There is no combination of lines that are going to work well with the roster construction we have because we are missing a 2nd line center that would tie everything together.You comment on the power play not using Ed as if the PP has been a problem. It's among the league's best at generating chances just scored 3 goals the other night (a couple of which were by the second unit).I still agree with the idea that we should move on to a coach that's going to make the game more fun and interesting for the players to play. Livening up the game will produce better results than asking guys to do things they aren't good at and don't enjoy. But this isn't all on Lalonde. This team is 2-3 players away from being pretty good. Desperately need another center and one good defenseman. People forget all the years we ran with 6 LHD and had good teams. There were times we didn't have a right shooting PLAYER on the ice. It's overrated. Get good players problem solved. It doesn't have to be a RHD we just need a 2C and a 2nd pair d-man or two."
detroitredwings,lxmb2jw,2024-11-17 12:22:59,>remember last year when I wrote a post titled it’s time to talk about coachingNo I don’t keep track of your post history
detroitredwings,lxmg4kx,2024-11-17 12:51:00,I’m just sick of watching bad dump and chase hockey for the last 7 or 8 years.
detroitredwings,lxlfzcz,2024-11-17 09:22:11,Our analytics say we should fire Lalonde
detroitredwings,lxktts9,2024-11-17 06:16:12,I don't even know how Lalonde survived until the end of last season honestly.
detroitredwings,lxl73nl,2024-11-17 08:18:24,Your last paragraph is so accurate!!! “A good coach uses systems which the players fit” this right here is EXACTLY what Dan Campbell and Brad Holmes focused on while building the lions squad and look at how well they’re doing!!! I also agree that we have good enough players and should be doing better than we are. Fire lalonde!!!
detroitredwings,lxkyh28,2024-11-17 07:04:20,Lalonde isn’t the biggest problem..the defense after ed and spider is ahl level at best. Half a game relying on petry Gus holl chariot….this isn’t going to win any games. Next biggest issue is we don’t have a 2nd line centerdrownings in 3rd line centers but nobody with enough offense skill to run a 2nd line. Lalonde isn’t the solution but with these problems no coach is gonna make compher or copp worth their contracts and no coach is going to turn petry holl or Gus into a viable 2nd pair defensive unit.
detroitredwings,lxks8bu,2024-11-17 05:58:53,I am very much reminded of the Nyquist tartar years right now and as I type this I realize that we're probably worse right now
detroitredwings,lxkzide,2024-11-17 07:14:09,Hot take: Yzerman is also part of the problem. Brilliant at structuring and negotiating extensions. Great at drafting. Dogshit at free agency.
detroitredwings,lxmfb99,2024-11-17 12:46:32,I remember getting shit on by this sub during the giant slide last season saying that lallonde was the only reason they were there in the first place. He is an awful coach they were there because we had a lot of people with career years. The stats corroborate that we were only winning games through sheer luck and defying expectations (the montreal games being chief examples of this). While this can be exciting to watch when it goes well if God forbid your players get cold it's over. Players go hot or cold all the time the coach needs to bring some motivation system and floor to their play in order to keep them in an acceptable range. People want to shit on the roster but I think they showed last year how great they can be when they are motivated to win; almost every player is skating through sludge right now and I feel like all of these things are on lallonde. Dont even get me started on him starting husso idk whose decision that is but they need to be fired immediately.
detroitredwings,lxnltg3,2024-11-17 16:33:24,I firmly believe it’s awful coaching.  Our roster isn’t great yzerman im sure looks back at some free agent signings and if he could redo it he would not going to hit 100 percent.  Still he needs heat on him so he actually fires Derek.  If he doesn’t fire him it shows stubbornness.  Derek has lost this locker room.  To those stating “last year was a fluke and we were trying to say this year will be a regression.”  Why? shouldn’t Mo be playing his best hockey?  Shouldn’t Raymond become a better player?  These kids are slowly or should be going into their prime.  Yes last year analytically we had some luck but I think with a new voice mo and Raymond will take the next step which the contracts they received show that yzerman is expecting the same.  Minus Larkin (never will say negative things on ole captain) no one is playing good. (Besides cam and larks) Derek fucking sucks nice guy made a ton of money go coach somewhere else Steve needs to fire him.  Steve gets next year for certain if we fumble next year questions should arise.  Half the people in here would give him 5 more years which is absurd.
detroitredwings,lxnzy2z,2024-11-17 17:51:59,Hopefully we lose to SJS on Monday. Lalonde gone after
detroitredwings,lxosynx,2024-11-17 20:43:06,Blashill was a departure from the Babcock style coach. His key trait was developing young players. He wasn’t a good enough head coach to stick long term. Lalonde was supposed to be the next best thing to Cooper since he worked on his staff for years. To be fair Cooper took several years to settle in as a solid head coach so I wouldn’t expect Lalonde to be great out of the gate. The problem with Lalonde is he clearly has an emphasis on statistics driving his decisions and systems but he doesn’t seem to be able to motivate the players. His lack of emotion likely numbs his players. I’d imagine he’s a great assistant coach but he is not a great head coach. The best coaches in the league consistently motivate their players to overachieve. Coaches change so often in the NHL because players lose the ability to maintain their peak play and need a new voice to get 110% out of them. Lalonde simply hasn’t gotten the best out of the teams he has had regardless of whether they were playoff caliber teams or not.
detroitredwings,lxl9kb2,2024-11-17 08:36:44,I don’t think Lalonde can lead this team but I also think the team is currently built in a way that makes it inherently uncompetitive. I think that even if this team was perfectly coached it would be a roster that scores at a pretty decent clip but still suffers due to its lack of defense off the first pairing. And that just means the nearest comparable is Buffalo. That’s not good enough.
detroitredwings,lxlgb7q,2024-11-17 09:24:23,There is 0 urgency with this org. Lalonde isn't getting fired because nobody cares all that much how the team performs.
detroitredwings,lxlnxmv,2024-11-17 10:12:40,"You can be mad about Lalonde all you want and I respect it. The facts are1. This is one of the oldest teams in the league2. They're up against the salary cap3. The roster is downright badThese are Yzerman problems. Don't hit me with ""BUT LOOK AT THE PROSPECT POOL!!!"" It's a nice pool. There are no elite talents in it coming to save us. Just more 2nd-4th line guys. Maybe Shai Buium can shore up Chiarot's spot and ASP can help move on from Petry. This team still has no Stanley cup caliber 1C no pairing outside of Seider-Edvinsson that can play against top lines and only one winger that can be a play driver (Raymond).I also question Dylan Larkin's leadership ability and his ability to elevate others at a high level/demand more out of them. Don't good captains motivate their teammates? Imagine Nick Lidstrom in this situation. Or Steve the player. They'd have done something at this point.Point the finger at the coach all you want but there are deep and disturbing issues with this team that a coach will only marginally fix."
detroitredwings,lxldnga,2024-11-17 09:06:05,Where is the on-ice leadership?  I don’t even know who wears the As and I watch most every game.  Give Seider and Raymond the As. And make Larkin work to keep his C.  Larkin is temperamental which is not a great trait when you have the role of being a leader every night.  And yes maybe it’s time for Lalonde to be let go so that someone else can extract more from this roster than anemic play every night.
detroitredwings,lxm5xru,2024-11-17 11:54:27,Will never happen. He's staying until his contract ends no matter what happens on the ice. That's what I learned from the Blashill experience. It's part of the Ilitch tradition to treat your employees with dignity and respect and once you've signed someone you don't just delete them. And it's not only Lalonde that's to blame. Some of Yzerman's transactions are part of the problem. For instance not having offensive D-men hurts us offensively. Adding Tarasenko has so far meant little to name another. He may blossom here later but so far...not so much.
detroitredwings,lxm7g8s,2024-11-17 12:02:50,I've stated it multiple times in any variety of posts in this Red Wings sub/Reddit these past few years - Lalonde is a poor choice for a head coach and he's been nothing more than Blashill part deux...Funny how long it takes many in here to figure it out.
detroitredwings,lxm9j9w,2024-11-17 12:14:23,I predict Newsy will be fired in the next 5 games if this continues 
detroitredwings,lxmbl8w,2024-11-17 12:25:50,We needed to tank with our young players for another couple of years instead of overpaying for older players to fill the gaps. Like it or not the only economic way to have a 1c in today’s league.
detroitredwings,lxmg47g,2024-11-17 12:50:57,The team got 5 times worst. Ghost for Gus is an downgrade. Perron for Tarasenko has been a downgrade so far somehow. And we lost walman for nothing. Kane plays top 6 minutes and can only keep up offensively. Defense is atrocious
detroitredwings,lxmr8ft,2024-11-17 13:50:03,Get him outta here
detroitredwings,lxmt0fi,2024-11-17 13:59:19,Last season the boys looked the best when they were crossing the blue line as a team with speed and confidence but it really feels like they have no momentum coming into the offensive zone anymore and any time they get into trouble they either dump it in the corner or make a sloppy pass that results in a turnover. It just doesn’t feel like they know how to play as a team!
detroitredwings,lxmwrd1,2024-11-17 14:18:48,Lalonde reminds me of some teen girl that works at a fast food place she hates and her face entire time says I hate this stupid job
detroitredwings,lxomzjt,2024-11-17 20:06:29,Quenneville can turn this around.
detroitredwings,lxpvu73,2024-11-18 01:19:46,this spineless hockey is fucking sad. the last person who showed spine and fought back was perron and his stupid ass cross checked the wrong person lmao. this team is so soft and boring. my favourite part is when the dump and chase and have another board battle. i fucking love board battles so much. nothing gets my blood flowing more than a good board battle
detroitredwings,lxl9mr3,2024-11-17 08:37:14,I agree 100%. I'm usually a very up beat guy and try to find the good in every situation. But when you bench ras and valano for motte....all while petry never gets benched. Petry should be playing in Taledo. The line pairings is punishment. Dump and chase. Puck in skates and back hands to no one.   Lalonde teaching Kane how he is supposed to play a 200ft game. Post game comments from lalonde and players make you wanna blend paint in your mouth. Time for this team to let loose.
detroitredwings,lxls1c2,2024-11-17 10:36:50,Have the red wings outshot an opponent in a single game this year? (I’m assuming not. I watch almost every game and I can’t recall one). The team looks flat and uninspired. I understand that this isn’t 100% on coaching and that some of our issues are due to lack of depth at center and on defense but lalonde’s dump and chase system does not work for the team. I would also expect the team to have a bump in performance after a coaching change (as most teams do). Coaches have been fired for much less in this league and as others have said he should have already been on the hot seat after the collapse in March of last year that saw the team go from having a 95% statistical chance of making the playoffs to narrowly missing. Failing to take control of the team back then was just as inexcusable as it is now.
detroitredwings,lxmeedh,2024-11-17 12:41:27,All the Wings need to do is look at the Lions. They held on to Patricia one season too many. IMO they should have fired him last season for missing the playoffs. All they needed was one more game to not go to overtime. I can’t help but think of that Sharks game last year. That’s not a game they should have lost. I almost forgot about the slump they went on with Larkin out. All but had playoffs locked up to not. Inexcusable. But he got a pass because it was the best season in a long time. But ultimately they failed. And look where it’s got them now. Taking a step back.
detroitredwings,lxn6nlw,2024-11-17 15:12:30,https://i.imgflip.com/9aomzw.jpg
detroitredwings,lxlsgil,2024-11-17 10:39:15,In simplistic terms a coach is supposed to get the best out of their players. Good roster or not (Yes Steve has set us back). Cup contenders or bottom dweller on paper shouldn’t matter. Ask yourself if the team is playing above or below where they should be. The answer is below and it’s not close.
detroitredwings,lxm7lmy,2024-11-17 12:03:38,Bring in Fedorov for the rest of the season as the interim coach. If he does well keep him or find someone else in the summer
detroitredwings,lxlk25r,2024-11-17 09:48:54,To your points: 1. Players did not go against the systems last year they had different systems. Kane partially signed here because he liked Newsy's X's and O's in his exact words. Yzerman was pissed about the defensive breakdowns despite the fact that the team he has built is not capable of playing that way. Lalonde played the team around how they were built. Yzerman actually went down and gave his players and coaches the riot act and told them they needed to be better defensively. I'd be willing to bet that Lalonde and Steve are having disagreements on how to coach this team and Yzerman got rid of guys that were able to play the way Newsy was playing them to give the team no other choice but to play this way. The problem with this team is roster construction and vision. 2. Seider has gotten exponentially better he's just having to do too much and can't play the way he should be able to because we only have 2 quality defensemen. If we had a deeper team you'd see Seider be Seider again. The problem with this team is roster construction and vision. 3. The lines he's putting together are because he really has no other choice. The top line is great and it's obvious. The second line is a hodge podge of players that don't work well together and the younger or skilled guys can't play those minutes. So he's got to go with the shitty options that he's got. The problem with this team is roster construction and vision. 4. Yeah Newsy sucks at motivating his team. But he's coaching the way he's being told to. The problem with this team is roster construction and vision. Ultimately he needs to be fired but only because I think Steve needs a brand new voice behind the bench to tell him that what he's trying to do is stupid and isn't going to work the way the roster is constructed. But that require Steve to actually bring someone in that challenged his views which knowing him he's the boss so he won't do that. Honestly I think we need to have the discussion about Yzerman as much as I hate to say it. The vision for this team is just not what a Cup contending hockey team looks like in 2024. He's drafting and signing the 90's Red Wings. I think we should bring in a new voice to the Red Wings not just keep hiring the old guard.
detroitredwings,lxm5j1i,2024-11-17 11:52:11,I agree that it’s time for a change . I honestly believe Steve thought Lalonde learned more then  he actually did from Cooper. Steve should go after Coop in the offseason if he’s not extended again . I think Coop would love a challenge like this .
detroitredwings,lxm86dm,2024-11-17 12:06:50,Very well said!!!  Nice summary 
detroitredwings,lxm8l3z,2024-11-17 12:09:06,Can you elaborate what's wrong with his system and his lines?
detroitredwings,lxmsl3p,2024-11-17 13:57:06,Consider this: Blash is to Holland as Newsy is to Yzerman.
detroitredwings,lxn9vm2,2024-11-17 15:29:46,I’m trying to make it so you can’t say “fire Lalonde” without suggesting another coach that’s available that will do better. I’m not saying there’s not… but just to shut up the lazy pisser and moaners.
detroitredwings,lxnnn1y,2024-11-17 16:43:26,He's trying to run at tampa like system but that doesn't work well if you don't have a defensive defenseman.
detroitredwings,lxopsx0,2024-11-17 20:23:42,Lalonde doesn’t need to be fired. Why replace the coach when the team is only playing slightly below where it should be. I didn’t see many if any analysts saying the wings would make the playoffs this season. They overachieved last year and it was great to see! But the team is basically where it should be. A couple more years and the scenario is very different t.
detroitredwings,lxor5oh,2024-11-17 20:31:59,"Forgive my ignorance. What do you mean by ""delays""?"
detroitredwings,lxpgk7n,2024-11-17 23:15:39,"I think the bigger issue is that all of the betting brokerages are creating large opportunities to change the game to make more money. Refs make bad calls or ""don't see""  things. Players don't seem to be at the top of their game sort of like shaving points we've seen or heard about in other sports. I didn't want to believe it about hockey but each and every game in the NHL is getting more and more difficult to ignore the fact that this is probably happening. Coaching or not since FanDuel has their own sports network now should be a bit of a red flag that something is afoot. That is the equivalent of owning a Lottery kiosk machine and keeping all of the winning tickets for yourself while letting the fools think they can win big and give you money that they desperately need. I for one will just watch the games as entertainment; just like WWE."
detroitredwings,lxs1scy,2024-11-18 11:43:59,LaLonde should have been gone last year when we went on that losing streak that knocked us out of the playoffs. If the owner had any guts or passion he would tell Yzermam to fire LaLonde and demand Yzerman produces or he will also be gone.
detroitredwings,lxshdmw,2024-11-18 13:02:22,Totally agree with so much of your assessment. Lalonde is a nice guy—but is clearly not getting the most from his roster and likely has even lost the team with his bland repetitive   messages.  I think we have seen enough now and Newsy has really been Blash 2.0.   He needs to go —-and soon.Larkin is often whiny and weak in his leadership and is not inspiring.   He is likely demoralized by so much losing in his career.  And Seider’s best season was his rookie one  though it is not popular to admit that.  Gustaffson Tarasenko Rasmussen Veleno & Petry have been terrible this year. And Raymond  is on track to be paid 8 million dollars for 12 goals. As of right now this team is headed for another ugly trade deadline sell off and no playoffs.  And Yzerman is largely to blame for signing so many mediocre veterans and being unable to hit with his draft picks beyond the 1st round. It does not seem like the Rebuild is on a positive trajectory.  It’s a significant regression from last season.  It’s now becoming easy to think about more years of no success. Without changes it could get much worse.
detroitredwings,lxm47mq,2024-11-17 11:44:57,Ya lost me when you said Seider regressed. Still facing the toughest minutes and still getting deployed almost always in the defensive zone minus now playing PP1. I'm sure it was a good read tho.
detroitredwings,lxl2s8q,2024-11-17 07:43:54,I would much rather talk about Steve Yzerman!!
detroitredwings,lxn6827,2024-11-17 15:10:11,I haven’t been on the Fire Lalonde bandwagon but the Anaheim game makes me think about it more seriously. We want to play possession low event hockey we had the lead and tried trusting the system and it completely backfired against one of the worst teams in hockey
detroitredwings,lxl4zri,2024-11-17 08:02:08,Walman as well. I’m still scratching my head over that trade.
detroitredwings,lxp0vgc,2024-11-17 21:32:01,I honestly thought ghost was definitely going to be missed when he left. He was critical down the line last year for the playoff push. Furthermore we NEED defenseman to have exceptional puck moving abilities. The defense jumpstarts the offense and when we can’t transition the puck everything else falls flat.
detroitredwings,lxlpz2r,2024-11-17 10:24:46,Yep. Maybe his defense wasn’t the best but his 60 points would look great right now
detroitredwings,lxms9p0,2024-11-17 13:55:30,Also the second goal at Buffalo where Edvinsson fires a cross ice pass to Seider before Mo has even finished getting over the boards.
detroitredwings,lxp6m16,2024-11-17 22:08:03,Didn't Kasper have a few shifts with them the first period?
detroitredwings,lxlscng,2024-11-17 10:38:39,I disagree it’s worked fine. All the young guys we have brought up have looked great and it’s in large part due to letting these vets plug holes. The actual problem is that the fanbase had these pie in the sky playoff aspirations when any realistic fan was repeating over and over that the team would not make the playoffs this year. Hell Yzerman refuses to put a date on the playoffs because this whole thing is fluid. But until a lion share of our prospects are on the team and a little seasoned this fanbase is setting itself up for heartbreak.
detroitredwings,lxlhqe8,2024-11-17 09:33:50,I gave him two extra years to unwind Hollands shit and three more to get his guys in. We’re two years behind schedule. I give him two more but this team needs to be playing at north of a wild card pace under whoever takes over for Lalonde and Steve needs to build on it for next season.
detroitredwings,lxmzzyn,2024-11-17 14:36:05,There is also the possibility that these swing-and-miss FA signings are failing due to Lalonde’s shitty systems and inability to create proper lines/pairings.
detroitredwings,lxnxfdb,2024-11-17 17:37:34,Wasn't able to watch the game last night. What's the context here?
detroitredwings,lxl6g1b,2024-11-17 08:13:19,There’s a chance ghost declined a contract from Detroit to play for a contender we may never know!
detroitredwings,lxlhvse,2024-11-17 09:34:49,I’m fine with the rookies seeing ice. The system is outdated in midget hockey let alone the NHL. Lalonde is holding this team back even though the team itself is perfectly average in terms of talent.
detroitredwings,lxlgl0d,2024-11-17 09:26:11,Wings sit 3rd last in the conference at the moment not exactly sure what team you’ve been watching but it’s going to take a lot more than a 2C for them to be a regular playoff contender let alone a Cup contender.
detroitredwings,lxl4n7j,2024-11-17 07:59:21,So Larkin is on pace for almost 50 goals that’s true. However point wise is on pace for 62 points in 82 games. Last year he had 69 points in 68. Tarasenko on pace for 30 in 81 he had 55 in 76 last year. Computer on pace for 30 in 81 last year he had 48 in 77. Kane on pace for 48 in 82 last year he had 47 in 50. Debrincat just like last year started hot and it’s yet to be determined if he keeps this up (I hope he does).Another point to make. You say Larkin is on pace for 50 goals. True but he has shooting percentage of 22.7 that’s not sustainable. His best season when it came to shooting percentage was last year 14.9% the 2nd best? 2021-22 146% so it’s more likely than not that he will fall down to that area of 13-15%. His career shooting percentage is 111% Btw Copp has 29.4%. Debrincat 179% career is 14.1%I already stated that Ed and Seider are amazing. Seider regressed in terms of delays. That’s what suspended everyone the first year how good at delays he was. He doesn’t do them at all under Lalonde. I said he regressed not cause of himself but cause of the coaching.Compher is genuinely an average 2nd line center. Yes our lines won’t be amazing but cmon… Lalonde saw last year and this year that line such as tarasenko-compher-Kane doesn’t work and he put it up multiple times.. then we got the defensive pairings which admittedly there isn’t much to do but when we still had Maatta he could have been doing what worked. Chiarot-Seider. Edvinsson-matta and Johansson-Holl. These pairs looked good together yet he didn’t use them much. It’s nice to have Seider and Edvinsson together but quite frankly it leaves our other pairs weak. The PP in the beginning of the season was somewhat a problem there he could have used Ed on the PP and see. Since Ed has all the tools I 100% believe that if Ed was on one of the PP it would improve even more. He is a really good mobile defenseman which can do everything. I do agree with the need for better D but the main issue of this team is the coaching. We have good enough players to put up better performances than we do now. Our average shots on goal are 25 2nd lowest in the nhl the only worse team are Canadiens with 245. Shots against we are 4th worst team 32.41 only ducks sharks penguins are worse. And we are 3rd worst in goals for with 42 tied with Blackhawks. The worst team? Ducks with 39… that’s how bad it is. And main problem is the coaching. We should be able to score more with this roster.
detroitredwings,lxlq0f9,2024-11-17 10:24:59,Thinking this team is one center away from functioning is delusional. Those red wings teams suffered heavily from 6 lhd which is why it's continuously brought up
detroitredwings,lxmuqjg,2024-11-17 14:08:13,Last year goals were not a problem they were among the leaders in goals scored.  This year goals are a huge problem they are near the bottom of the NHL.
detroitredwings,lxqk5fc,2024-11-18 05:41:31,The Red Wings aren’t just missing a 2nd line centre. They are simply a bad and surprisingly old team. They had an unsustainably high shooting percentage last year. Their current place in the standings is closer to their actual level.
detroitredwings,lxmp7dj,2024-11-17 13:39:34,Need a true 1C as well. This team won't contend with Larkin as our 1C.
detroitredwings,lxmdw5a,2024-11-17 12:38:38,Why I said that was cause it was pretty controversial take last year in December.
detroitredwings,lxnn9x0,2024-11-17 16:41:26,You and me both my friend
detroitredwings,lxm90h0,2024-11-17 12:11:29,I said this previously but I feel played because I gave Lalonde and Stevie the benefit of the doubt the last 3-4 years because they were rebuilding.   But it’s clear now the rebuild may not have begun.  Sad sad realization. 
detroitredwings,lxlknma,2024-11-17 09:52:42,They nearly made the playoffs and it was his second year. Think about it.
detroitredwings,lxlfq57,2024-11-17 09:20:26,The Detroit Lions GM is doing a better job than the Detroit Red Wings GM.Never in a million years would I have thought that until now. 
detroitredwings,lxldbua,2024-11-17 09:03:49,The Lions have a great roster. The Red Wings don’t. Big difference.
detroitredwings,lxlg7eq,2024-11-17 09:23:40,Thank you. As an outsider looking in I’m super confused on *why* Red Wings fans think they’re a playoff level team. You take a maximum of two of those guys and hope they build chemistry to play as an incredible third pairing at best. None of Petry Holl Chiarot or Gus should be a serious part of your top four. The offensive depth is just also not there when you’re relying on Lucas Raymond and the ghosts of Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko. Fans of the Wings seem to be blaming Lalonde but it’s kind of clear the roster (and therefore Stevie Y) is the bigger issue here.
detroitredwings,lxl0jnv,2024-11-17 07:23:52,> Half a game relying on petry Gus holl chariotI told people our D is shit this year and nobody believed me.But how can you fix this?Its not that Tampa is willing to trade Hedman or Buffalo does not want Dahlin anymore.Maybe check in with the devils about Nemec he is not playing that much with them.
detroitredwings,lxlrx8u,2024-11-17 10:36:11,This is all true but our roster isn’t that piss poor to be tripled up on SOG constantly. Huge system issue
detroitredwings,lxl9x0v,2024-11-17 08:39:20,I mean so many people act like free agency is just names on a list that you select and they automatically sign with your team. These are real people with families and agents and personal preferences.
detroitredwings,lxrkr3r,2024-11-18 10:13:28,Keep in mind that with UFA the guys you sign WANT to play in Detroit…There’s more than just waiving a bag of money in front of their faces.
detroitredwings,lxmfthb,2024-11-17 12:49:20,For me last season my main issue was that this coach doesn’t know how to hype up his players he doesn’t motivate them at all. Many games last season we lost due to motivation they came out flat every single start of a period and then they had to catch up. We had many comebacks last year (unsustainable) due to that. This year it’s even worse they are unmotivated the whole game.
detroitredwings,lxm2okc,2024-11-17 11:36:33,Red wings have always had a history of never firing coaches.
detroitredwings,lxlqelw,2024-11-17 10:27:19,Great comment and you eloquently summed up exactly what I think and how I feel word for word.Also as a person born and raised in Michigan I watched every season of Yzerman's career as a player since his rookie year in 1983; and he and Grant Hill are my two favorite and most loved admired and respected players of all-time.
detroitredwings,lxmnpwd,2024-11-17 13:31:53,I got worried last year when Larkin was out hurt and no one seemed to step up to fill the leadership void. Where were the A’s?
detroitredwings,lxmr3s9,2024-11-17 13:49:21,Get tired of hearing that Larkin is a top 1C in the league. He's average and would be a 2C on a cup team. Don't know how that will change. Teams wait years for a top 1C and you probably have to draft 1.
detroitredwings,lxlhdb6,2024-11-17 09:31:27,Great point. Our assistant captain situation has baffled me for years. I honestly don’t even know who wears the A I think it still rotates? The fact that Copp has ever worn an A is a complete joke. Seems like As just get shuffled around amongst the veterans as if that’s how captaincy is supposed to work
detroitredwings,lxmp1tz,2024-11-17 13:38:47,The players are employees too and if they are dissatisfied with the coach or their careers are suffering under the coach then the respectful thing to do would be to at least consider firing the coach.
detroitredwings,lxm99m9,2024-11-17 12:12:54,Actually Seider is better offensively than many offensive Defenders but it’s the coach who doesn’t allow him to play such style. Remember his delays in first season? He doesn’t do them anymore. Why? I guess cause they are risky (extremely hard reward) and Lalonde wants low event hockey
detroitredwings,lxnko11,2024-11-17 16:27:10,They sure are treating their employees with dignity and respect by putting that garbage patch on their uniform
detroitredwings,lxmb02k,2024-11-17 12:22:35,It’s unfortunate. I was skeptical when he was hired. I thought there were better options and as it turns out I was right. The 1st year of Lalonde I wasn’t impressed but I didn’t judge cause it can take time for the team to adapt to new system etc… last year I made a post in December about Lalonde and people were mainly pissed (I didn’t say I want him fired yet though).
detroitredwings,lxmdqku,2024-11-17 12:37:46,Honestly I at this point hope we lose against San Jose and he gets fired
detroitredwings,lxmz14m,2024-11-17 14:30:57,Agreed
detroitredwings,lxnou6d,2024-11-17 16:50:00,Yup
detroitredwings,lxlg2ry,2024-11-17 09:22:48,Ras and Veleno are forwards. Petry is a defensemen. We’re already down a guy with Ed injured. Who are we replacing Petry with?
detroitredwings,lxnlgxb,2024-11-17 16:31:32,They outshot rangers last time they played pretty badly it was honestly their best game of the year that I've seen and they couldn't score against Quick so they lost 4 to 0. Was a pretty disheartening loss.
detroitredwings,lxlx4k8,2024-11-17 11:05:56,Yeah both things can be true.  The roster ain’t great (though I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as people make it out to be; some people act like this roster is on-par with the 19-20 AHL squad Wings).  And Lalonde isn’t getting the most out of his players and isn’t putting them in a position to succeed.  The former is harder to address because you can’t fire each problematic player (and honestly we would need to have a serious conversation about Yzerman at that point) but you can easily fire the coach and see what happens with a new voice and mindset leading the team.
detroitredwings,lxmvpqa,2024-11-17 14:13:18,You think Fedorov is going to take an interim job? lol
detroitredwings,lxmdnx4,2024-11-17 12:37:21,The system simply doesn’t fit our players. Good coaches make system based on the players. The system is supposed to elevate the best attributes of the players. In his case he did the opposite. He created a system where different attributes of our players are supposed to be elevated and quite frankly our players are bad at it. Like you can’t expect Kane to be a great player if you change his style. He isn’t a dump and chase player. He isn’t a forechecking guy. He is the guy who drives offense. Lalonde basically wants all our players to change their style of play. We have skilled players but he doesn’t let them use the skill. That’s the issue. When it comes to lines well it’s simple. Multiple times last year and this year we saw him putting up the same lines even though it’s clear they don’t work together. They lack chemistry etc.. but he puts them together no matter what. I like to use the defense as example. When we still had maata he put up pairs such as Petry-Chiarot. Maatta-Holl and other abominations.  When he could have done something like this (he did it once and it worked but then switched again) Chiarot-Seider. Edvinsson-Holl/Maatta (this pair looked good with either of them) and Johansson-Holl/maatta. Petry scratched. When it came to forwards he liked to push Kane and Debrincat together as much as possible. Despite the fact that they didn’t work as expected. Better line was and still is Debrincat-Larkin-Raymond. The we got tarasenko he was forcing him on the 2nd line when he didn’t look good there instead of trying other players.
detroitredwings,lxnm68y,2024-11-17 16:35:25,Jay woodcroft for example.
detroitredwings,lxqed3o,2024-11-18 04:38:09,It’s what Seider was doing in his rookie season. Only about top 20 defenseman in the league are capable of doing. It’s when Seider is in our d zone and gets possession of a puck and gets attacked. Instead of dumping the puck to neutral zone. He delays and deceives the attacker and makes a perfect breakout pass. Best explanation would probably be a video by Elite Prospects: Moritz Seider is already a No. 1 defenceman and he’s only getting better
detroitredwings,lxm8xrq,2024-11-17 12:11:04,Mate read it again… I said he regressed in one aspect… and that’s the delays he made in the first season. Gosh I love Seider and I think he is amazing but to say he didn’t regress in that aspect is just dumb. I also stated it’s not his fault. It’s fault of coaching since they don’t allow him to make the delays which are risky and Lalonde wants low event hockey.
detroitredwings,lxl4xrt,2024-11-17 08:01:41,Is there plenty of mistakes he made yeah but genuinely the main problem is the coaching. When it comes to Yzerman I think he still is a great GM and our prospect pool looks great. It’s the free agency which is the concern however even then we don’t know if it really is a problem since our coach is god awful. The free agents under different system perhaps would look much better. We don’t know
detroitredwings,lxl6r2t,2024-11-17 08:15:44,Walkman was and continues to be a locker room issue now that he’s on the Sharks he’s good but one man does not a team make. Of course we don’t know the ins and outs of what’s going on behind the curtain but from the chatter that slips out Walman seems to think he’s a one man show that doesn’t need to work with the team and that just doesn’t work in any sport. No one guy can go it alone the entire game and arrogance doesn’t exactly endear you to the team.Totally agree with Ghost though he’s a beaut all around and I was super bummed to see him get traded for what amounts to basically nothing. I have to wonder if he was a driver behind going against the system a few times last year and instead of rewarding his leadership they gave him the boot. Hope burns eternal that he’ll come back to the Wings someday 
detroitredwings,lxm2dvd,2024-11-17 11:34:55,I’m pretty positive there was some behind the scenes issue going on with Walman and that’s why he was traded. Only thing that makes sense lol.
detroitredwings,lxnn5q5,2024-11-17 16:40:49,Oh yeah I remember that
detroitredwings,lxly5mj,2024-11-17 11:11:36,I think the exciting finish to the season last year is largely to blame. Everyone got stoked because we got so close. However in all reality the team wasn't that good. All the metrics pointed to our record being more a product of luck than talent and the prediction was we'd come crashing back to earth. Now that it has actually happened everyone is getting salty about it and thinking the team is underperforming when we just weren't that good to begin with.NHL rebuilding is a very slow process. I agree with you that Yzerman's approach has been working well. Our first round picks are all looking like hits so far and it's just a matter of time before they're on the roster and we're legitimately competitive.
detroitredwings,lxltz21,2024-11-17 10:47:57,"This is the most reasonable take i have read in here since the dawn of this subreddit.You are also totally correct.I have tried asking people who should be in the lineup that isnt in the lineup and no one can name a single player or prospect. Now you can blame that on drafting but you cant blame that on Yzerman for signing Copp. The second Danielson shows he is NHL ready and better than Copp Yzerman has proven multiple times he will not hesitate to waive Copp and fire him into the fucking sun if Danielson should be there. Walman got the foot when Edvinson declared he was ready Motte was told to eat popcorn in the pressbox when Kasper showed he was ready Mataa was dumped for picks when Johanson showed he could play. To circle back to Copp now you can make the argument we should have signed someone better than Copp.Two takeaways on this: 1. You need to find someone who actually wants to play here. And 2 who says the goal was to find someone who was good? Who said Yzerman was looking for a needle mover? Who said he was looking for a player to propel the rebuild forward. Cup contenders sign heavy big names in free agency to try to take them over the bump we are not that kind of a team so why would Yzerman go after those names. I dont think he ever intended to do that when he signed Copp or JT. I think he intended for them to be classic stop gaps ""meh"" ""OK"" ""fine"" ."
detroitredwings,lxlxwma,2024-11-17 11:10:13,> All the young guys we have brought up have looked greatAll four of them huh?
detroitredwings,lxm8qbm,2024-11-17 12:09:54,Well I guess he failed time for you to move on.Bye.
detroitredwings,lxoqg2e,2024-11-17 20:27:39,Larkin was signaling for a time out after scoring late in the third as he skated back to the bench. coaching staff either didn't see (huge benefit of the doubt there) or completely ignored him (outside of being vindictive can't understand why they would?). it was really really bizarre.
detroitredwings,lxo10qf,2024-11-17 17:58:11,I think he might have benched Larkin or something I have no idea though I just have been hearing some shit went down between the two of them. I heard people complaining asking “why would he do that to larkin he’s the only one trying” so I assume he didn’t give him ice time or something
detroitredwings,lxlin89,2024-11-17 09:39:49,He took a pay cut to play for Carolina after he had a great season with Detroit. That is absolutely what happened.We weren't keeping him for the $3.2m he's getting paid now.
detroitredwings,lxngx68,2024-11-17 16:06:44,The reason Ghost is gone doesn't matter. It still points to a giant hole in the roster. It still implicates the roster as a problem. A bigger problem than the coaching. Our defense wasn't great last year. Then we lose two key parts of it for whatever reasons. In comes 2 rookies. Even if they're both good almost no rookie especially a defenseman is going to be without some big mistakes in their rookie season. 
detroitredwings,lxlc91l,2024-11-17 08:56:11,Maybe at least the Walman trade then makes some sense if your paying ghost.
detroitredwings,lxljlzm,2024-11-17 09:46:02,What aspect(s) of the system has lalonde instilled that are problematic and what systems would you run differently to solve it/them?
detroitredwings,lxlrnaw,2024-11-17 10:34:35,What are “delays” by seider? Never heard this term before lol
detroitredwings,lxlo8q8,2024-11-17 10:14:30,I just remember all of the blown leads and a team that looked unprepared and outcoached on too many occasions. That's what I think about.
detroitredwings,lxlg0hi,2024-11-17 09:22:24,The Tigers President of Baseball Operations too; who also works for the same owner.
detroitredwings,lxlq7ls,2024-11-17 10:26:10,The lions two years ago did not have nearly as much talent as they have now. Guys like sam laporta and gibbs were not on the offense for example. But they manufactured wins by using what they had. When they beat the Jets it was largely on the strength of a 50 yard touchdown by brock wright. The problem with this team is literally no one is empowered to do anything
detroitredwings,lxlhgg5,2024-11-17 09:32:01,Who created this Red Wings roster and has been responsible for the front office scouting development drafting staff training/coaching amateurs free agents decision making identity organizational leadership/vision and style of play 17 games into season number 6?
detroitredwings,lxlebcf,2024-11-17 09:10:44,The lions have been completely turned around and are now superbowl contenders in less time than Yzerman has been with the wings…. Same as the red wings the lions also sucked 5 years ago…. Look at them now! I know its the NFL and NHL we’re talking about here so its not exactly an apples to apples comparison but shit man…. They both have a salary cap both are focused on draft picks…
detroitredwings,lxlhdc3,2024-11-17 09:31:27,I still blame the draft (and the changing of Draft odds not in our favor)
detroitredwings,lxlh0c8,2024-11-17 09:29:02,Why did you include Lucas Raymond in that context in your comment?
detroitredwings,lxlke80,2024-11-17 09:51:02,Yea. If you can shut down the wi gs top line of wear put their top d pair….beati g the rest is nothing. Our 2nd line is a great 3rd line on any good team. And our bottom 4 defense isn’t likely playing anywhere else that wins games. People have blinders on when it comes to rating the wings. They see all the potential but few of the flaws. Our offense would be ok if our defense was better our defense could be overlooked if we had 3 good offensive lines rolling. Our goalies can keep us in games and even win a few but they’re not the shutdown type that runs a game like Hasek or Brodeur. 2 ways to really win regularly are to either have a guy or two who can single handed run a game ( these guys are not easy to come by so don’t rely on that). Or to a depth roster. A roster where you can comfortably move guys from 3rd line to first line. Where you rely on your forth line to fill a vital role. A defense where you can move any player up or down a pairing and not miss a step. A team where if your top c or d gets long term hurt you’re seasons immediately over. The wings are no where close to that. Just manage the wings top line and defensive pair and the rest are such a massive step down in talent that beating the wings is easy.
detroitredwings,lxn4dy6,2024-11-17 15:00:11,I agree with you but we're seeing enough coaching problems to want to alleviate them.
detroitredwings,lxl4cbs,2024-11-17 07:56:55,This season it ain’t getting fixed. Cap space isn’t there to do it right. I think Yzerman put all his chips into getting trouba and when that fell apart there was no plan b. I get all the “fire Lalonde” calls but he’s done ok with a shitty team. This team is shit no matter whom coaches it. No elite players. Minimal scoring depth 2 1B goalies and a defense that is one of the worst talent wise I’ve ever seen. Any one of those problems could be overlooked by excelling in other areas. Make up for bad d with great offense make up for average offense with stellar d a goalie who can single handed win games most nights no outstanding talent but enough depth at all positions to wear another team down….the wings have none of that. We have a good first line a 2nd line in need of a center and a 3rd and 4th line with 0 identity beyond being players who can’t really score enough to be on the top 2 lines. Half our lines are literally mismatched scraps. And that d…..what’s left to say.? Petry runs your 2nd pair?!? That’s a huge problem. Lyon and Talbot are good not great if there was a competant 2nd pair d in front of them we’d be a play off team. Not a real contender but we’d get in.We’ve got Maata off the books Husso Lyon and petry after this season. That’s 10-12 million in cap space….that had better get 1 $10 mil a year defenseman or 2 $6 mil a year guys to put this defense into shape. Every cent of cap space needs to fix this defense. Period. We can’t bring Cossa or any offensive prospects up and expect them to succeed in this system where everybody has to cover for the shitty defense. No coach will make petry more than he is (a 3rd pair at best). Give me a defense where petry and chariot are running a 3rd unit for 8 minutes a game and the top 2 units are competent….we’ll be a significantly better team.This years problems are not lalondes fault…Lalonde didn’t put that didn’t put our defense in petry Gus and holks hands. (Or pay them nhl money for ahl talent)Yzerman and his free agent signings are what ills this team the most. Kane was a success but there’s been a lot of misses around him.
detroitredwings,lxlu171,2024-11-17 10:48:18,The system is poor the bottom half talent is pathetic. With talent most any system can work. No system will make petry or holl or Gus into talented or even average defenseman. They wouldn’t even see the ice on most any other team. And that’s half our defense.
detroitredwings,lxlgfiz,2024-11-17 09:25:10,No dude you don’t get it. You just throw a number at them and they accept the first offer and come play for you. That’s how it works in the video games so it’s basically real life. Joking aside people are like this about trading too. “Idk why we don’t just go pick up an above average right handed defensemen?!?!?!” like they are in an over abundance.
detroitredwings,lxlkpmx,2024-11-17 09:53:03,Could’ve just skipped offering Holl Copp Chariot Gustafsson. No issues getting guys “on board” if you don’t offer a contract in the first place
detroitredwings,lxlseu4,2024-11-17 10:38:59,Exactly. Everyone keeps whining saying SY is signing shit players to bad contracts but players have to WANT to come to Detroit. And if SY doesn’t sign mid range vets with experience because the high end players don’t want to unfortunately having to overpay these guys in most cases then every year would be like the 19-20 season
detroitredwings,lxluukm,2024-11-17 10:52:57,You aren’t wrong but that doesn’t mean we have to sign bad contracts. We’ve whiffed on a lot of multi-year deals. If this is what it took to sign the Copp Chiarot and Holls of the world then pass on them and move to the next name on your list. Or maybe see if there’s a similarly talented player on a bad contract that a team needs to dump their money that we could take on to achieve the same goal as signing someone in FA. For all we know Yzerman’s plan with drafting and developing could work out as well as he could hope but you can’t have a 23 man roster filled with only your draft picks and I’m genuinely concerned that Yzerman would continue to fill in the gaps with bad acquisitions considering the track record he and the pro scouting have had in FA.
detroitredwings,lxm3a27,2024-11-17 11:39:51,I can’t stand the EA NHL or Madden type mindset people have behind the business of sports lol.
detroitredwings,lxrl0mx,2024-11-18 10:14:56,This …UFAs will want to play for a certain team - nobody is automatically selected and that’s that…Some people continue to surprise me on their lack of knowledge on the matter.
detroitredwings,lxmtho0,2024-11-17 14:01:47,Maybe you’re misunderstanding. I’m not blaming Steve for not landing the biggest and best free agents. I’m blaming him for giving out multiple multi year player very friendly contracts to meh veterans who haven’t panned out. Every GM will have one or two of these. Nobody is perfect. But Yzerman seemingly has built our roster around them.
detroitredwings,lxlhcmp,2024-11-17 09:31:19,It’s okay you can admit Yzerman isn’t perfect. #stevebot
detroitredwings,lxrvuuu,2024-11-18 11:13:22,I see this point a lot and I’m not forgetting it. I guess my question is is it wise to keep overpaying midtier free agents on longer term deals? Is Detroit that bad of a place to come that we need to both make the dollars AND term large? I think I’d have less issue buying the argument if we had to lure them with one or the other. But committing above market value dollars for longer terms pushes me into the “let’s get more creative in the trade market or draft and let the young kids play” camp.
detroitredwings,lxmxpp3,2024-11-17 14:23:49,Larkin is still in that room. It can still be Larkin. It's not like he's hiding somewhere. That's my issue with it. It can be A's but there's not excuse for him not to step up
detroitredwings,lxme983,2024-11-17 12:40:39,Yup - same...Skeptical about the hire but Yzerman had hired him for an assistant role in TB so there's the familiarity and hope he would evolve as a Cooper clone (instead we got a Blashill clone)...I too got many downvotes in here with my questioning of Lalonde and his ability behind the bench - to me it was bloody apparent that he wasn't a good fit here for multiple reasons.But yeah - too many drinking the 'kool-aid' with wishful thinking...
detroitredwings,lxlq82b,2024-11-17 10:26:14,Anyone. Heck I would replace him with you.
detroitredwings,lxn6i2q,2024-11-17 15:11:41,Well if you read my post the idea was interim for the rest of the year and he’d earn the permanent job. First coaching job outside of Russia
detroitredwings,lxmfhsc,2024-11-17 12:47:32,I appreciate you taking the time to respond. I do think there's ways we could get more out of this roster but it's marginal how much it could improve this team. Maybe there's a coach out there that can take this team deep but I don't see it. We are just still in a fragile state where we take whatever we can get. It's not like we are passing over better options that take us the whole way. Regardless it's not a clear cut decision.
detroitredwings,lxl5ox8,2024-11-17 08:07:26,Lalonde is employing/using some variation of an Yzerman approved system play style and overall hockey philosophy.
detroitredwings,lxl7374,2024-11-17 08:18:18,We didn’t trade him we let him hit free agency
detroitredwings,lxl7et4,2024-11-17 08:20:47,I’m not a fan of this thing some fans do. You can’t say “well we don’t know what happened” and then make up some unsubstantiated claim that he’s a locker room cancer and that he isn’t a good teammate. There’s a constant need to protect yzerman from criticism and it gets old
detroitredwings,lxlk494,2024-11-17 09:49:16,The same issues that has caused him to have 9 points in 13 games while playing big minutes? He missed a meeting while hurt that he said he wasn’t aware about. Said he accepted the punishment as it’s a rule and he broke it. What a bunch of nonsense. All I’ve heard about him and his issues is like 95% conjecture.
detroitredwings,lxqtq2w,2024-11-18 07:13:01,What makes you think Walman is a locker room issue? Haven’t heard a single thing about that.
detroitredwings,lxmz6jv,2024-11-17 14:31:45,Fixing ‘locker room issues’ is seems way easier than finding a replacement player with the same production in FA. Sadly sports teams have access to various trainers coaches etc. to assist with improving physical play but when it comes to mental health issues or off-ice stuff all teams are like “ idk bud. The only help we can offer is benching you. If that doesn’t work you’re gone.”
detroitredwings,lxlp2px,2024-11-17 10:19:27,Is he a locker room issue if he's right about his complaints? People blindly backing yzerman in all of these situations is naive. Dudes giving away the talent and signing trash long term. Get yzerman out he's not the guy. This team has been nose diving since Nill left. Need a front office shake up before I take this team seriously. Honestly red wings don't make the playoffs the next 5 years if you look at the contract situation. Larkin is gone or cooked by then.
detroitredwings,lxni5np,2024-11-17 16:13:25,100% this is the biggest issue. All the advanced metrics said we played far better than we should have last season and with such an exciting end to last year its raised everyone’s expectations. Now we are playing where we probably should have been last year. Minus some league leading goaltending wed be even worse right now. You cant really fault the coach for that. Bring in someone new they might get a short bump but then what? No coach is gonna turn Andrew Copp into Connor Bedard. This team lacks elite talent and we dont have enough of it. Hopefully Cossa and ASP help with that but honestly the bedt thing for this team is a top 3 pick and then have Cossa danielson and ASP come in next season and the growth comes from the youthMy main criticism of Yzerman comes from adding too many mid veterans (copp chiarot) that kept us from competing with getting the likes of Bedard fantili celebrini etc. nothing can be done about the lack of draft luck and i get not wanting the losing culture. But still. Nhl rebuilds are never linear. Patience is required. Hopefully next year the young guys take the step we need.
detroitredwings,lxmzc39,2024-11-17 14:32:36,“NHL rebuilding is a very slow process.” Yes agreed but this is year 9 since we made the playoffs no?Some of the delay should be attributed to the previous GM Holland but some of it must be tied to Steve now too.As for what do we do with Lalonde (the talent we have on this team feels like it’s better than our record demonstrates) as much as I would like to tie the trouble to him there’s something to be said for the overall rosters he’s received.Admittedly I just noted the talent on this team feels like it should be performing better and that’s typically a coaching issue.But who are we gonna get who’s truly better in that role?
detroitredwings,lxlyez6,2024-11-17 11:13:02,Exactly this.
detroitredwings,lxml5fb,2024-11-17 13:18:17,I made a pretty similar comment a week or two ago. The team over performed last year and too many fans raised their expectations well beyond what was reasonably expected for this roster.
detroitredwings,lxlxf7y,2024-11-17 11:07:34,">I think he intended for them to be classic stop gaps ""meh"" ""OK"" ""fine"" .5 year contracts aren’t stopgaps."
detroitredwings,lxma15e,2024-11-17 12:17:12,Critical thinking isn't a thing to find in Reddit.  I come here for news and pulse of things.  This was going to be a down year.  I'm disappointed in the dog shit play and systems the team are performing at though.  Getting a new coach won't do much this this roster but this is not a fun team to watch.
detroitredwings,lxly67d,2024-11-17 11:11:42,Well yeah man this is going to take time lol. Thats why playoffs aren’t realistic this year. You got Kasper Edvinsson and Johansson this year. Then over the next two seasons you should have some combination of Danielson Cossa ASP MBN Buium and Mazur.Rebuilds take a long time especially rebuilds without top picks. Idk what else you were expecting.
detroitredwings,lxm9ipq,2024-11-17 12:14:18,Every year somebody graduates and you end up having to walk back everything you said. In 3 years there's going to be lots of walking back going on. Because it's inevitable that we improve when we replace Fisher with Nygard. Petry with Asp. Copp with Danielson. The fan base will have you believe these are lateral moves but just laugh at them.
detroitredwings,lxmaia8,2024-11-17 12:19:51,Sorry some people want a team to be competitive after not making the playoffs for 8 years.
detroitredwings,lxq2u1h,2024-11-18 02:29:50,>or completely ignored him (outside of being vindictive can't understand why they would?)I think it’s pretty simple.  It’s because Lalonde is an atrocious game manager that consistently refuses to use of the few tools he has at his disposal to influence the game.His team’s captain is calling for a timeout in a crucial situation like that end game scenario?  Nope.  No need to listen to him.  Just roll out the next line.His team has a lead and has given up quick goals threatening or erasing said lead?  Nope.  No need to ice the other team’s momentum or reset your own squad just keep things rolling and hope for the best.He’s in over his baldass head.
detroitredwings,lxlrbwa,2024-11-17 10:32:43,This is where it’s Steve’s fault because if we had loads of cap space you overpay the guy by 400k for an extra year. Instead we’re paying Holl Copp Tarasenko etc
detroitredwings,lxm595t,2024-11-17 11:50:42,He’s running a dump and chase soft 1-2-2 system with a roster flush with guys who can carry the puck into the zone with speed. If we want to do that with Rasmussen and Coop sure. Build lines for it. But to fundamentally throw it down everyone’s throat while also forcing wingers like Raymond and Cat to more or less then drop into what tries to pass as a lw lock in the NZ is stifling our top two lines. Defensively it’s been hammered on but here it is again - Lalonde just imitates what Tampa does. Which is as close as pro hockey gets to man/man in the dzone. It forces guys to work as a unit (fine) and Cycle along with the offensive players which again sounds great but when you’ve got the rotting husks of Ben Chiarot and Jeff Petry trying to man up on modern wingers……yeah. If I knew exactly what he needed to do I’d do it for a living. For one I’d split Seider and Ed and allow Ed much more freedom to move forward with the puck on his stick or in service of the breakout. For two I’d stop being afraid of letting speed get up ice. Play a more conservative defensive zone system but let the wings either break pressure and offer stretch passes or push opposing teams back into their trap a bit quicker. This rotating system we play has dmen in bad spots to start breakouts when they get the puck - why every breakout is 2-3 reversals as the dmen get themselves into position - which leads to turnovers even though we keep our wingers close.  it’s abundantly clear that Lalonde sees one way to play hockey in each zone and isn’t willing to adapt those principles for the roster he has. Steve hasn’t done a good enough job but it’s the coaches responsibility to put his roster in positions to succeed and I have zero confidence that Lalonde is willing to do that.
detroitredwings,lxm0yr7,2024-11-17 11:27:08,Watch the highlights of his rookie season and it will be obvious. It’s the delay when he has the puck in defensive zone (mainly after recovering the puck after dump) and he gets attacked. Instead of dumping the puck into neutral zone he evades the attacker and makes a perfect breakout pass and sets up our forwards for a chance. That’s why his first season he was considered one of the absolute best defenseman in the league with tremendous potential
detroitredwings,lxly6om,2024-11-17 11:11:46,It's a bad look to the casuals if you fire the coach after the team's best performance in 8 years.
detroitredwings,lxm4iea,2024-11-17 11:46:35,Maybe the problem is that nobody is stepping up?  I highly doubt that the coaches are holding back the offense from not sucking.
detroitredwings,lxlflha,2024-11-17 09:19:33,NFL draft picks can make an immediate year one impact.  NHL takes years to develop with a few exceptions.  I’m not letting Yzerman off the hook here but the draft lottery has not been kind to the Wings at all.  And who knows how much cheap ass Jr. Ilitch is preventing the GM from paying for free agents.
detroitredwings,lxlfvtc,2024-11-17 09:21:31,The Lions have sucked for 70 years dude….recency bias is a hell of a drug.
detroitredwings,lxlipnf,2024-11-17 09:40:15,The draft definitely plays a part in screwing the Wings roster at the moment. I think while there’s *some* good talent there Yzerman failed to to surround them in a sensible way. You only need one of a Copp and Compher just one of a Kane or Tarasenko just one of a Chiarot Petry Holl etc. Instead this current iteration of the Wings are infested with old dudes or players clearly done growing. This isn’t a recipe to reliably make the playoffs at all.
detroitredwings,lxlkx8m,2024-11-17 09:54:20,The draft lottery luck certainly hasn’t helped….that being said….we didn’t draft petry Copp Compher Gus Holl chariot or Husso…and the draft certainly didn’t give them bloated contracts. The draft hasn’t helped but many of those acquisitions and signings are death blows. Our defense was poor last year and we could afford to bench Holl 90% of the time. We are now relying on Holl this season….thats terrifying.
detroitredwings,lxlhrgw,2024-11-17 09:34:02,I feel he’s one of the Wings’ best offensive weapons and genuinely someone the offence leans on. In my comment he’s emblematic of the issues that plague the younger Wings “star” forwards (Raymond Larkin DeBrincat) which is that none of them are true superstar players that leads teams.There are the main guys of a cup team and then the important guys that compliment them. For the Pens Crosby and Malkin were supported by Kessel and Guentzel for example. Without Crosby and Malkin playing the toughest of roles and excelling guys like Kessel and Guentzel don’t excel either. Raymond Larkin and DeBrincat are amazing Kessel-type guys in this equation. However Stevie Y decided to overpay the fuck out of veteran free agents on offence and defence cutting off the important part of the rebuild too quickly without getting those offensive superstars (Hence relying on the ghost of Patrick Kane and Vlad Tarasenko).
detroitredwings,lxmtt5f,2024-11-17 14:03:26,So instead I’m supposed to thank Stevie for chariot Holl copp contracts? I don’t blame him for not building the 2002 wings. Not possible in today’s game. But he’s continued to hand out some stinkers even after seeing some of his contracts become stinkers.
detroitredwings,lxn6vbl,2024-11-17 15:13:42,That’s easy to say but we didn’t know those guys would all end up being bums. Hindsight is 20/20 obviously and we needed bodies
detroitredwings,lxmzixp,2024-11-17 14:33:36,I understand the frustration and some of the contracts aren’t aging well but you have to fill a roster and you need NHL players. We don’t know what contracts were offered and turned down by more ideal players. Sometimes you have to take the hand you’re dealt. If the players that were signed did well people would be calling Yzerman a genius.
detroitredwings,lxlj5cj,2024-11-17 09:43:05,Why are you using hashtags on Reddit when no one even uses them on Twitter anymore
detroitredwings,lxsbv0x,2024-11-18 12:34:54,Unfortunately for the lack of actual NHL caliber players on the roster and far too many draftees (that’s a good thing) this team has to go out and ‘attract’ UFAs to play on a rebuilding team…Some will come here - some do not.My point of view is that these UFAs appeared competent prior to their arrival in Detroit…Since joining the Wings they’ve been playing below expectation…Blashill and now Lalonde is the issue here.
detroitredwings,lxn7r3d,2024-11-17 15:18:27,I don't think there's anyway in hell Fedorov the dude that was like the hold out king would leave a good gig in the KHL for an interim gig he'd demand a multiyear contract imo...who knows though it would be a great interim hire.
detroitredwings,lxleslg,2024-11-17 09:14:02,If you think the GM gets fired before the coach then we should bet on it!
detroitredwings,lxl7d82,2024-11-17 08:20:26,My mistake but the outcome is essentially the same.
detroitredwings,lxmgrmv,2024-11-17 12:54:32,Treating Yzerman like he has total immunity is driving me fucking crazy. He’s doing a bad job. Simple.
detroitredwings,lxl8sk0,2024-11-17 08:31:01,I’m going off of what Warsofsky after Walkman’s healthy scratch a few games ago “No one is bigger than the team” Warsofsky said of Walman’s scratch. “We’re about the team and getting better as an organization our culture our standards is really all I can say to that.”Additionally there were murmurs all last season about Walman having an attitude. Stevie made some bold moves trade-wise due to cap space and “other reasons” and currently I think it’s safe to say not all of them are paying off (at least yet) but I don’t think Walman was the one that’ll keep us from the playoffs.
detroitredwings,lxl9flq,2024-11-17 08:35:44,I get you want to hate on Yzerman for whatever reason but the guy is known for off ice antics. Getting drunk at the Tin Roof instead of coming to practice whilst he was being heathy scratched. Guy has a major ego. And then San Jose saying the same thing off ice issues. Don’t know why a 24 point player is getting people bent out of shape. Go figure the guy with neck tattoos that dances on the ice causes problems behind the scenes…
detroitredwings,lxl8unn,2024-11-17 08:31:24,I’m partially going off of what Warsofsky said after Walkman’s healthy scratch a few games ago “No one is bigger than the team” Warsofsky said of Walman’s scratch. “We’re about the team and getting better as an organization our culture our standards is really all I can say to that.”Additionally there were murmurs all last season about Walman having an attitude.

detroitredwings,lxro09u,2024-11-18 10:31:27,"""*Yes agreed but this is year 9 since we made the playoffs no?""*Because Ken Holland dragged the team into the playoffs for like 3 seasons too long by doing exactly what everyone is complaining Yzerman is doing *strategically* not to make the team playoff-competetive but to show the young guys how to be a pro for 82 games.     Guys Like Copp and Chiarot are more than just what their on-ice product is. We peanut gallery members don't know what grinds these seasons are where these young players are used to playing half that load.     And it's not like other teams are just trading away game-changers or that they hit the FA market frequently with their prime A-Game still intact and ahead of them. Any GM would need to plug holes on this roster with lesser players at inflated contracts while the drafted prospects ready their games.  We keep getting somewhat decent on-ice return and good locker room leadership on short-term contracts that will come off the books as our prospects hit the NHL. Feel free to save this post and come check back in in a few years. Enjoy watching the young guys grow into their roles in the meantime and be grateful GMSY is not chasing waterfalls right now. The roster isn't ready for big swings on trades or FAs."
detroitredwings,lxlydcw,2024-11-17 11:12:47,For this rebuild it is. By the time Copp and Chiarot are off the team most of our prospects will finally be on the team.
detroitredwings,lxmnxrb,2024-11-17 13:33:02,Or $6 mil dollar players
detroitredwings,lxlysus,2024-11-17 11:15:12,Depends on how big the gap is a rebuild is 5-15 years.
detroitredwings,lxlyk4w,2024-11-17 11:13:50,I am expecting more and better prospects sooner with fewer geriatrics anchoring (and I do mean anchoring) the blue line.
detroitredwings,lxmmbax,2024-11-17 13:24:29,Johannson. Yeah there's an elite D man
detroitredwings,lxmbo8l,2024-11-17 12:26:17,We made the playoffs for 25 years straight. If life was fair you would be waiting another 17 years lol.
detroitredwings,lxlu9lf,2024-11-17 10:49:38,That doesn’t make sense. $400k more than $3.2m is still less than we were paying Ghost last year. He signed a prove it contract with us went out and proved it and that got him a position on a contender. He wants to win a cup and he was never staying here because of that.
detroitredwings,lxo5fzg,2024-11-17 18:23:58,"Cool thanks. Lots of people complain about ""the system"" but far fewer actually seem to understand hockey systems in general. I don't think the 1-2-2 is inherently our problem but I do wish we ran it more aggressively. I wouldn't agree though that we are flush to carry the zone with speed. We legit have 2 maybe three guys who can do it reliably (Larkin Raymond and occasionally Kane and Kasper but Kane certainly doesn't prefer a zone entry at pace). We do run an aggressive 1-2-2 forecheck with a couple of lines namely with razor and cat and they've been quite effective at it. I think our biggest problem has been only our top line reliably carries the zone. Kane stuck with Compher and Copp isn't helping much but that line needs to kick out and drive the net more. We rely too much on Kane to carry but there's so little playing off him. Vova -Kasper-Berggren has actually be quite reliable with the bump and chase and with a solid forechecks in pursuit. Kasper's hockey IQ is quite solid and he's great at entering puck battles from a good position especially for a guy his age. It's actually quite impressive.Our big issue  is that with our 4th line we've got Ras/Fischer/Veleno/motte who really can't manage anything besides a dump and chase but their offensive upside is so incredibly limited that they're just praying for mistakes. It's brutal.I do wish we'd change things up defensively a bit but I think we're seeing a bit of nuance from Lalonde. I really strongly believe we can't split Ed and Mo right now unless we move one of Gus or Johansson to play with Mo. Chiarot's gap control has been abysmal lately and he can't move a puck usefully to save his life at this point. But I could see Ed and Petry being passable again just cant manage the Chiarot-Mo pairing. Their styles just flat out don't mesh. Mo wants to apply the pressure lalonde is looking for and chiarot is too stay at home unless the play is a total lock. I think the biggest issue we may have is that we have such piss poor puck retrieval defensively that we are giving up essentially 20% of the ice due to have deep our forwards have to drop to start a rush. There are nights where it looks like we're playing into a trap but it's really just that our line is 20ft deeper than they should be because we can't retrieve and turn the puck up ice and our outlet passes are challenged almost at our blue line half the time. Ghost and Walman both helped in this regard so much despite having other gaps. Johansson has shown signs but he's young and undersized and with Gustafsson so soft to play alongside it's been tough on AlJo. How would you reshuffle our top 6 to get away from the soft entry and towards more control? I've got ideas but am struggling to avoid breaking up the 3rd line which has been meshing pretty well lately.Also I'm eagerly awaiting Corey Sneijders zone entry data to drop to see more of our underlying data compared to the league."
detroitredwings,lxnune1,2024-11-17 17:22:02,I’ve never heard this before described as delays haha but more possession. I 100% agree. Lalonde is a passive defensive system that’s really “get the puck out at all costs” and “dump and chase” but don’t go all out chasing. Hence we never win the dump and chase battle lol
detroitredwings,lxli0il,2024-11-17 09:35:41,Also the worst teams in the NFL get the easiest schedules the next season. It’s apples to orangutans.
detroitredwings,lxlv80j,2024-11-17 10:55:07,Well we’re pretty much at the cap (or we were until we traded Määttä so I think it’s pretty clear ownership has given a green light to spend. It’s just that the money has been poorly used.
detroitredwings,lxlt3v2,2024-11-17 10:42:58,Yeah i know that… i was talking about the lions previous 5 seasons to the red wings previous 5 seasons
detroitredwings,lxm3cs8,2024-11-17 11:40:16,Facts and perfectly stated!
detroitredwings,lxllul9,2024-11-17 10:00:04,A Larkin debrinkcat Raymond line can work without any elite Crosby /McDavid superstars if you can also role strong 2nd and 3rd offensive lines. If you have enough offensive depth to just wear the other team down and give them trouble defending all 3 lines. You don’t need a superstar. Compher roles some decent offense as a 3rd line center because he had two lines ahead of him wearing other teams down here he’s a reach as a #2.You either need an elite player who can raise everybody up or enough depth to wear the other team down….the wings lack both.
detroitredwings,lxm3n14,2024-11-17 11:41:49,Gotcha!!
detroitredwings,lxndrl4,2024-11-17 15:50:31,Which is why you’d like the people being paid handsomely to scout give opinions and make those decisions to be right more than they have been. Pro scouting should be more accurate than amateur scouting as you have years of NHL track record to base your decisions off of yet we’re whiffing way too often. Some of those contracts were obviously not great before the ink was dry too.
detroitredwings,lxrwi45,2024-11-18 11:16:44,I guess by that logic nobody should ever praise or challenge a GM. “It could have gone the other way”. But. It didn’t. Multiple times with multiple guys. Very fair to raise an eyebrow imo. Nobody is calling for Steve’s job. But the whole point of my original comment is that he’s not without blame after 5 years either. He’s made a fair number of significant cost moves in free agency over multiple free agency markets that haven’t really made the team that much better. That’s just a fact.Now does that make him a *below* average NHL GM? Probably not. There are some bad GMs out there. But it also means he’s probably not actually a prodigy top tier GM like we all wanted to believe when he came here.So far he’s a fine GM who has improved a bottom of the barrel team to slightly below league average team. It’s taken him 5 years but he started with nothing. He’s made some good moves and some head scratchers and he should be scrutinized just as much as any other GM would be at this point with this track record.Everyone agrees LaLonde is not good and a problem. But he was Yzerman’s guy. So it’s fair to question Yzerman too in my book.
detroitredwings,lxn8icx,2024-11-17 15:22:29,He’s not coaching CSKA anymore so he’s available. That’s why I think there’s at least a chance. The interim tag would be just to prove himself as I’m guessing this will be Yzerman last coaching hire before he’s replaced
detroitredwings,lxlpcbo,2024-11-17 10:21:01,No it's worse because we got no assets for one of our top d. No assets for leaving talent is a red wing cliche
detroitredwings,lxlk8aj,2024-11-17 09:50:00,"It doesn't mean your guess is untrue but Walman explained the scratch recently. Not sure if you missed it: ""I missed a treatment session for my upper-body injury on our day off our treatment day and it's a team policy that you got to be in there if you're dealing with an injury. Just from my end I misunderstood our treatment plan. That was the reason for the scratch.""He also mentions that there's only divulging the real reason because it became a news story. Doesnt mean this isn't part of a larger issue but it's not evidence he's had for the locker room."
detroitredwings,lxmhs1q,2024-11-17 13:00:04,Need those good in the room guys like Chiarot Holl Petry Copp etc. Those are the guys that will take this team places lol.People can criticize the coach all they want he's trying to get the team to focus on team defense just like the G.M. said they needed to improve on the problem is his system isn't working and the roster isn't very good.  People that try to put this entirely on the coach are out to lunch this roster was never going to make the playoffs that was evident long before the season started.  A better coach might make them incrementally better but they still aren't a playoff team regardless of who is behind the bench.Honestly he might be the best guy for the job right now the team is not getting in the playoffs so they may as well target the higher draft pick.  Yzerman messed this up in 2022 when he signed Copp and Chiarot and continuosly doubled down each F.A. period since perhaps they can get another chance at an elite talent in the draft this year if they keep sucking.  I'd prefer that(and selling whatever they can at the deadline or sooner) over finishing 17-20th.Obviously need some growth out of the young guys but I don't care about how the team finishes really they don't have the players to turn this around so just embrace the suck and hope they can get a legitimate difference maker in the draft.
detroitredwings,lxqtucv,2024-11-18 07:14:01,He was a healthy scratch because he didn’t go to treatment for his injury because of miscommunication.
detroitredwings,lxl9ryc,2024-11-17 08:38:18,Go figure the guy asking about points from a defenseman is also reducing him to his own opinion of people with neck tattoos and a personality. Stick to your Twitter gossip
detroitredwings,lxmlkp3,2024-11-17 13:20:31,That griddy was so fuckin stupid
detroitredwings,lxlztjk,2024-11-17 11:20:53,Honest question would you be saying the same thing if Ken Holland signed those contracts?
detroitredwings,lxlz34h,2024-11-17 11:16:48,Petry is gone this season if ASP should want to be up but my guess is Yzerman is thinking ASP is going for a season in the AHL and be up the year after that perfectly timed with when Chiarot is gone.
detroitredwings,lxlyubx,2024-11-17 11:15:26,Okay well ASP and Cossa have top end upside Danielson could be a very good top six center MBN could be a very good physical scoring winger. We’ve had 1 top five pick since Yzerman took over due to repeated bad lottery luck and honestly? The first round drafting has been very good. The later round drafting hasn’t been bad either but those type of guys take even longer to develop.Edvinsson is only a full time guy now. Do you see how this takes time yet?
detroitredwings,lxmmvll,2024-11-17 13:27:29,Now this is a strawman argument. I said good to great and he’s good.If you’re expecting a Zetterberg or Datsyuk 2.0 you’re setting yourself up for heartbreak. The odds of drafting a superstar with a second round pick or later is literally in the single digit percentage points of probability. It’s literally in the math. But does that mean our later round drafting has been bad? I would say no so far just look at Mazur Augustine Lombardi Buium Buchnelnikov and both Johanssons.
detroitredwings,lxmn3eb,2024-11-17 13:28:39,There’s a ton of people that weren’t there to see those 25 years
detroitredwings,lxmdmr3,2024-11-17 12:37:10,Loser mentality
detroitredwings,lxlvoru,2024-11-17 10:57:47,It was not specifically meant for ghost sorry should have clarified. In general I mean having more flexibility/extra for guys you want or should keep around is always a good thing and we don’t have that as the 26th ranked team which is horrible. I understand the contender concept obviously from a player standpoint
detroitredwings,lxnyc31,2024-11-17 17:42:48,Well possession is one thing but the specific thing Seider and very few top defenseman (usually the very best like top 15 defenseman in the league) are capable of doing delays. Possession is different to delays. To understand what I mean go on YouTube and search Elite Prospects Moritz Seider is already a No. 1 defenceman and he’s only getting better.
detroitredwings,lxluy04,2024-11-17 10:53:31,Yeah but I’m pointing out it isn’t that easy…..point being it took us 70 years to find a competent coach and solid roster. Not to mention hockey is way more difficult to rebuild in. Not even close to what you can do in the NFL. The only common denominator is they’re both sports. That’s about it.
detroitredwings,lxlmx5b,2024-11-17 10:06:31,What (other than homer-bias) can you even say to argue my point? The proposed line that can work makes no sense when you look at the last five cup winning rosters. Florida: Matt Tkachuk Alex Barkov Sergei Bobrovsky Vegas: Jack Eichel Mark Stone Alex PietrangeloColorado: McKinnon Rants Makar. Tampa: Stamkos Hedman Kuch Vasi Point. St Louis: ROR Tarasenko Pietrangelo. Defensively the Wings have the top-end talent but no one to support them. Offensively the Wings have incredible tertiary talent but no one to take the lead. Meanwhile the players that are contributing to the offensive or defensive mediocrity have long and expensive contracts. This means you have to mentally-bend logic and say “If this thing happens” four times in a row to make your point.
detroitredwings,lxmsxku,2024-11-17 13:58:54,That's funny
detroitredwings,lxn96w4,2024-11-17 15:26:09,That would be cool!  He's kinda an ego guy but would be cool if that happened I'd be pumped asf!
detroitredwings,lxlrng7,2024-11-17 10:34:36,The only way we would have gotten assets for Ghost is if we moved him at the deadline and teams don’t move players at the deadline when they’re in the mix for the playoffs like we were. Weird thing to complain about.
detroitredwings,lxm4gwu,2024-11-17 11:46:22,I’m not saying he’s lying or anything but there’s always this side that side and the truth. It’s equally likely that management may view Walman as an off-ice problem because he’s outspoken or lacks tact when bringing up concerns something many young people improve on over time. Honestly I would’ve liked to keep Walman because personally I think the Wings could use more players with an attitude on ice. When they’re physical with the right lines and strats on ppk the team is absolutely deadly. It seems to me that Lalonde and Yzerman seem to prioritize a more technical approach with less use of force (which is a whole other thread speculating the reasons pros and cons around that) but the guys especially defense and the more defensive players seem to really shine in their roles allowing our shooters to shine in theirs when they can use force to create space and break up formations.
detroitredwings,lxmkdtc,2024-11-17 13:14:12,I’m not sure anyone who’s never played understands how big a deal it is to not meet your obligations to the team and be scratched as a result. “I misunderstood our treatment plan” dude as an athlete it is your job to meet all obligations to the team no errors no excuses. Fucking up like this is a HUGE deal especially for a pro. The fact that he even made an excuse without completely owning it and played it off as a misunderstanding speaks volumes about Walman.
detroitredwings,lxmlbxf,2024-11-17 13:19:15,Most sense I've heard all day. This roster sucks no elite talent middle six prospects. No coach could turn this crap into a playoff team. If they're gonna suck then suck as bad as they can and at least try and get a top 5 pick. History says they won't get a top 3 but 5th overall is better than 15th.
detroitredwings,lxlyg4k,2024-11-17 11:13:13,Don’t use twitter I work in the city. I see these guys more often than not out in the real world.
detroitredwings,lxm0hn0,2024-11-17 11:24:34,The context is different. Holland signed bad contracts while trying to prop up an aging core. Yzerman is signing some bad value contracts to shelter a rebuilding team. If Yzerman signs Copp type contracts as the team enters its competitive window then I think there will be plenty of room for criticism.Let me be clear I think the Holl Chiarot and Copp contracts are all bad contracts I just don’t think they matter at all right now.
detroitredwings,lxlz6tm,2024-11-17 11:17:22,Yeah I wouldn’t expect ASP next season but I suppose anything is possible.
detroitredwings,lxmiy3u,2024-11-17 13:06:27,> Edvinsson is only a full time guy now. Do you see how this takes time yet?My friend this is Yzerman's 6th year. It's not seeing that it takes time that is the problem. It's the not hitting on later picks and questionable free agency decisions.But you keep on building that strawman. You clearly take comfort in it.
detroitredwings,lxmojjq,2024-11-17 13:36:09,I get it but we are trending towards being a contender rather than away. This doesn't justify everyone pissing their pants every loss. It's exhausting because the people that understand hockey knows this is a process. It's not like the NFL where if you are a bottom team you are guaranteed a championship in a few years. Casuals live by this gospel and apply it to hockey.
detroitredwings,lxmew16,2024-11-17 12:44:10,Same with spending all day on a sports sub reddit trying to get a guy fired.I just can appreciate what I had and I'm very grateful. Can you propose the alternative roster that we could have traded for a signed that would have made us a contender? And if not then I guess you'll have to be patient.
detroitredwings,lxlw2f7,2024-11-17 10:59:57,to me it seems like the lions got a new owner who actually cares about the team and everything has fallen into place since then… your statement is inaccurate maybe it should say it took the lions 70 years to get to a competent owner… she brought in the beastly management team and from there its taken them about 5 years to have a solid roster. Edit: 5 years to have an unstoppable super bowl contending roster.
detroitredwings,lxltiqr,2024-11-17 10:45:20,Yea I wasn’t calling it a cup winner just less embarrassing. But ask McDavid even elite talent isn’t always enough.
detroitredwings,lxmtcfm,2024-11-17 14:01:02,"Wings fans are always saying you don't need elite talent to win. History says otherwise. You're right. Larkin Raymond Cat. Those are ""supporting cast"" players and depth pieces. What we need are the Thachuks Barkovs etc. Stutzle is turning into one of those guys"
detroitredwings,lxmyc6j,2024-11-17 14:27:11,Brilliant counterpoint…..![gif](giphy|qmfpjpAT2fJRK)
detroitredwings,lxn9i0g,2024-11-17 15:27:46,Ya that’s true. I just think he could be a good hire as he understands the red wing way and their high standards. But would add some swagger and creativity. Hopefully a healthy balance
detroitredwings,lxlvg7k,2024-11-17 10:56:26,> Weird thing to complain about.Im not even going to respond to that dude so im responding to you instead:Yzerman tried to move him and no one wanted him. You can ask me for a source and i will answer back; do you have a source he never tried? Neither of us can say hence why the discussion is pointless.
detroitredwings,lxls9ps,2024-11-17 10:38:10,Big reason they lack talent. Should have traded him amongst many other players that have just walked for free. They didn't make the playoffs did they? Regression this year? So is it a weird thing to complain about?
detroitredwings,lxmvvhg,2024-11-17 14:14:08,He did own it. We can't pretend to know how their communication is. Shit happens. I understand your point but messing up once is not world ending.
detroitredwings,lxsflf9,2024-11-18 12:53:28,"??? He literally said ""my fault I misunderstood the plan. That's why I was benched."" In what universe is that not owning his mistake lol."
detroitredwings,lxn6fgg,2024-11-17 15:11:17,What a stupid comment. Raymond Larkin Kane DeBrincat and Tarasenko are all 30 goal scorers. Kasper and Berggren have scoring touches. Seider and Ed are great defensement. Our goalies are good.
detroitredwings,lxm51eb,2024-11-17 11:49:29,I don't enjoy watching this team and feel it's a terrible product as a die-hard fan since the early 80's.So those bad long-term contracts for bad/mediocre players that play every night do matter to me as a fan who watches all of their games.This team is not good fun to watch or elicit much hope for me right now.
detroitredwings,lxn9use,2024-11-17 15:29:39,I would have agreed with you a year ago but Copp has kind of grown on me. He buys into the system plays his part and does so at a high level. He doesn't ring up big numbers but he's been consistent and seems like a good locker room presence.Still not even disagreeing with your take. I agree but I've found myself appreciating Copp more as time passes.
detroitredwings,lxmjn26,2024-11-17 13:10:12,Yeah man his first two picks are on the team the third and fourth first round picks just made the team.This shit takes time and later round picks seldom hit but that said? Both Johanssons Lombardi Augustine Buium Buchnelnikov and Mazur all look like good to great later round picks. They take even longer to hit generally speaking.There’s no strawman here tell me anything I’ve said that’s incorrect.Rebuilds take years without significant luck like Panarin joining a rebuilding team. Look at Ottawa Buffalo Montreal Anaheim San Jose Philadelphia Columbus Chicago. This shit takes time. Until Detroit can get a lion’s share of these prospects on the team which is still another two years away expect comparable results.
detroitredwings,lxmmq5w,2024-11-17 13:26:41,Dallas hit on all their picks and look very good 
detroitredwings,lxn0z62,2024-11-17 14:41:26,"I also assume a huge part of the ""fire the coach"" noise comes from overflow football fans.  They are used to a sport where a coach has direct control over how the team plays as opposed to a far more random fluid sport in hockey."
detroitredwings,lxluhjw,2024-11-17 10:50:53,Ahh I see. I’d agree that elite talent isn’t always enough however I’d argue that it is a bare minimum that you need 2-3 true superstars at their positions. Seider is one but over anything else the Wings need a star that can push Larkin to the second line where his game is the perfect fit.
detroitredwings,lxltvj4,2024-11-17 10:47:24,Yes it’s a weird thing to complain about. You don’t deal pieces at the deadline when you’re gunning for a playoff position like we were and the return you’re going to get for players on expiring deals isn’t great anyway.You’re acting like dealing these players would have notably improved our prospects for this season but it wouldn’t have.
detroitredwings,lxmwrle,2024-11-17 14:18:50,The lessons learned in that stretch of meaning full games is far more valuable to the prospects we have than the ones we don't have..
detroitredwings,lxn87g9,2024-11-17 15:20:53,None of those guys are superstars. Need at least a couple. Not rocket science. Tarasenko's a has been
detroitredwings,lxm737a,2024-11-17 12:00:48,Okay was the team fun for you two years ago? How about three four or five years ago? I know it sucks but THIS is rebuilding.
detroitredwings,lxnjjer,2024-11-17 16:21:00,I agree it isnt fun but what is your alternative? We havent had lottery luck. So we dont have a bedard fantili celebrini type to get truly excited aboutYeah sure they could over pay for a chandler stephenson or a steven stamkos but look how thats going for seattle and nashville. You cant build a long term winner in the cap without shrewd trades drafting success and timely free agent additions when you are approaching your window. Wings are in none of those positions due to a lack of lottery luck the fact that second round picks and beyond take years to develop (if they even dl make the nhl). Drafts like dallas’ when they got robinson oettinger and heiskenen are so rare its ridiculous. Its why the wings draft of fedorov lidstrom konstatinov is so revered bc of how rare it is. Its like everyone we got spoiled bc we one 4 cups and made the playoffs for 25 straight years but forget that was off the back of 10+ hall of famers and a league that didnt have a salary cap along with our former gm leaving the cupboard barren to try and keep that playoff streak alive.
detroitredwings,lxnc4zt,2024-11-17 15:42:06,His contract is objectively bad. He doesn’t produce at the level the contract dictates. I like him too but it’s just reality. But I don’t think it matters that he’s overpaid either.
detroitredwings,lxmn7p2,2024-11-17 13:29:17,All those teams you just mentioned have elite prospects selected in top 3. Makes a big difference 
detroitredwings,lxmugkd,2024-11-17 14:06:48,Finally someone who sees Larkin as a 2C on a good team. We need more outside opinions
detroitredwings,lxp0fwt,2024-11-17 21:29:20,And you followed it up with another stupid take. Well done.
detroitredwings,lxmxag6,2024-11-17 14:21:34,"""We should just skip the rebuild it's an inconvenience on my day to day life."""
detroitredwings,lxrj144,2024-11-18 10:03:40,Rebuilding and looking competitive is one thing - something we do not have…Most nights this team looks off sloppy not ready to play when the puck drops and that is on the coaching staff.For the record - I was skeptical of Lalonde after his 1st season and definitely wanted him gone this past May.Finally some people are figuring it out.
detroitredwings,lxnsh7b,2024-11-17 17:09:59,It's been a very long very uneven rebuild. The Yzerplan may still work out but it's not been without plenty of hiccups. Also he waited too long to move on from Blash and he's waiting too long to move on from Lalonde.
detroitredwings,lxmngwd,2024-11-17 13:30:35,And they’re still in the basement despite that edge. Many of whom longer than Detroit.
detroitredwings,lxk6a71,2024-11-17 01:59:11,A head coach with a track record at the NHL level after the last two hires would be nice.
detroitredwings,lxk8chk,2024-11-17 02:20:02,I would take a fucking ChatGPT over Lalonde at this point.
detroitredwings,lxk7962,2024-11-17 02:08:50,Lalondes contract ends exactly when Coopers does. There's a plan here.
detroitredwings,lxk7ivt,2024-11-17 02:11:36,I think it’s time to end the failed lalonde experiment
detroitredwings,lxkc7gp,2024-11-17 03:01:05,I still say I want THE PROFESSOR
detroitredwings,lxkc7px,2024-11-17 03:01:10,Any of the ones not named Q.
detroitredwings,lxk6m9o,2024-11-17 02:02:30,I’d rather the corpse of Harambe over Q. Fuck him forever just like Babcock.
detroitredwings,lxk837w,2024-11-17 02:17:25,Joel Quenneville should never work in this environment again. He should never be in a position where anyone has to rely on him for their safety in their workplace.Go work in a call center dude. That’s what you’re fit for 
detroitredwings,lxkk7pj,2024-11-17 04:29:38,I’d pass on 3 of these 4. McLellan I guess I wouldn’t have a problem with. He’s not my first choice but he’s got a Calder cup as a head coach a Stanley cup with us in ‘08 as an assistant and he’s coached some teams to some notable success. Gallant? Fuck no. Absolutely positively no. Gallant has coached some successful teams including Vegas to the SCF to their inaugural season final run but he fucked up pretty much every prospect he touched most notably in New York. With us still being a developing team I don’t want him anywhere near our club. Woodcroft I’ll pass. The experience isn’t there and considering Edmonton made a cup final immediately after they dumped him which seemed reactionary at the time it makes me question whether he’s as capable as it seemed initially.Lastly there’s Q. I don’t think much needs to be said here but I will just in case. Look if we’re talking coaching merit alone I’d definitely take him. But we obviously aren’t just talking about that. So no thanks there are other options and what he *might* bring to the table isn’t worth it. As far as anyone else? I’d take Boudreau. I think he’s a better coach than he’s given credit for and he seems to be able to bring quite a bit of offense out of his teams. That aside I dunno who else there is I’d want that has experience. Maybe Claude Julien? He has a Stanley cup a Jack Adams and some experience with young/up-and-coming teams. Other than that eh. We’ll have to see. I’m just done with Lalonde.
detroitredwings,lxk86vf,2024-11-17 02:18:27,Q? No thanks too much baggage.Woodcroft? No couldn't win in Edmonton. He's not gonna move the needle here.Gallant? Maybe to finish out the year but thats it. He is a development assassin exactly what you don't want over the next few years.McLellen? Again maybe to finish out the year and we see how things go with him before committing long term?I would rather we fire DL and let Tanguay interm to see if he can do anything. I mean he runs the power play which is one of our few bright spots.Or we could promote Dan Watson but that feels unlikely as the Griffs are doing great. He may be better served coaching in GR this year and potentially bring him up next year?
detroitredwings,lxl0pc3,2024-11-17 07:25:20,None of these guys inspire much hope in me. Outside of his baggage I don’t see Q coaching a team that’s not a contender any time soon. Gallant is awful with young players. Woodcraft doesn’t have a big track record. Todd is fine - if you like boring defensive hockey that the team is already playing. Also it’s worth noting Yzerman has never hired a head coach with NHL head coaching experience AFAIK. I’d rather wait until the season is done so there’s more options and so Yzerman can change this roster. And it’s going to have to be someone who will play young guys - realistically we will be adding one or possibly two of Mazur Danielson Soderblom and Ammo to the team next year and maybe one of Wallinder/Buium and maybe even Cossa. The youth movement is happening.  I don’t have a preferred candidate right now but I think both Tanguay and Watson would at least get interviews if it was an offseason change. David Carle Mike Sullivan Jim Montgomery Martin St. Louis Todd Nelson Andrew Brunette… there could be some interesting options in the offseason.
detroitredwings,lxkweyq,2024-11-17 06:43:43,I definitely don’t want quenville if that’s what youre saying
detroitredwings,lxk8b01,2024-11-17 02:19:37,Sounds like you’re insinuating Q is the choice. I would much rather any of the other 3 or even keep Lalonde than see that happen.
detroitredwings,lxk9vwi,2024-11-17 02:36:13,To be honest I think the Wings could use a couple more high draft picks this year to seriously set them on the path to success with the next coach. I also think it extends beyond the head coach you need great assistant coaches and sometimes you need to hire a big name to get those great assistants.I'm not so sure about any of these guys.
detroitredwings,lxlcaxc,2024-11-17 08:56:33,Lalonde needs to go but this roster construction is awful too. Once Lalonde goes it means yzerman is the next to go if the team doesn't get better
detroitredwings,lxm70cq,2024-11-17 12:00:21,I came to the comment section ready for war but I'm glad to see everyone on the same page. Fuck Q
detroitredwings,lxk7pht,2024-11-17 02:13:29,Spuddy up and rot in pieces Q.
detroitredwings,lxlzw88,2024-11-17 11:21:18,If we hired McLellan instead of 12 shots on goal a game we’d have 4.
detroitredwings,lxm6myc,2024-11-17 11:58:17,2 of those guys couldn’t win with McDavid and Draisaitl
detroitredwings,lxn6x76,2024-11-17 15:13:59,Joe Q is a hard no. Fuck that guy. Should not even be on the list.
detroitredwings,lxkkode,2024-11-17 04:34:50,If Steve picked Q I would lose my fandom probably for life... It wouldn't just ruin the team to have that fuckface it would tarnish all the magic of the 90s and 00s knowing The Captain hired that horrible person
detroitredwings,lxmbevw,2024-11-17 12:24:51,Fuck Quenneville. I'm fine with everyone else.
detroitredwings,lxk92s4,2024-11-17 02:27:38,“Thank you!” Bye Coach Gru. It is time!
detroitredwings,lxlwu3z,2024-11-17 11:04:18,I would hope you don’t mean Q. I’d take Todd in a second
detroitredwings,lxmdosb,2024-11-17 12:37:29,As a Florida fan if Detroit wants to take the next step and compete in the Atlantic get Gallant. He does well in his first season or two and is a players coach. He is not high on rookies but he will have no choice with what the roster is. Plus think of all the interviews with Mick .
detroitredwings,lxmsakc,2024-11-17 13:55:38,If we hire Q I’m showing up to the wings front office with a harsh message
detroitredwings,lxn6jxu,2024-11-17 15:11:58,Fuck Quenneville. I don't care about his past success. He should never be allowed near another NHL team.
detroitredwings,lxk60fn,2024-11-17 01:56:33,Dan Watson.
detroitredwings,lxkvvru,2024-11-17 06:38:10,At this point why? So we can rebound and miss the playoffs by a few points again and get a mid round pick? May as well stick with Lalonde fight adversity and get a better pick and make a change in the offseason. This is not a playoff roster.
detroitredwings,lxl5r6r,2024-11-17 08:07:55,I would have a real hard time seeing Q behind our bench.
detroitredwings,lxk6o72,2024-11-17 02:03:00,Having Todd McLellan back would be nice or Gerard Gallant
detroitredwings,lxk5xwz,2024-11-17 01:55:52,Gerard Gallant took Vegas to the SCF their first year I’d love to see what he could do with this roster
detroitredwings,lxknv1j,2024-11-17 05:10:32,I would like woodcroft But idk tbf
detroitredwings,lxlp9z9,2024-11-17 10:20:38,Never Q absolutely fuck that
detroitredwings,lxk6y0c,2024-11-17 02:05:43,Woody couldn't win with 2 of the best forwards ever. Q has too much baggage. So between Mc and Gallant...give me Gallant.
detroitredwings,lxkgcoj,2024-11-17 03:46:35,I was calling for Gallant long before the Lalonde hire.
detroitredwings,lxl5iqi,2024-11-17 08:06:05,No no no and hell NO!
detroitredwings,lxlct4z,2024-11-17 09:00:09,Bring in nightingale
detroitredwings,lxle2up,2024-11-17 09:09:04,David Carle is the name I'd want. I know it's not going to happen but need some sort of dream with this team.
detroitredwings,lxli2y0,2024-11-17 09:36:07,The main pedigree should be lengthy proven NHL experience and a PROVEN TRACK RECORD that they can develop prospects close to or past their supposed ceiling. We are absolutely struggling with turning our blue chips into the elite (or better than good) players that they need to be for us to not be stuck in a perpetual state of mid.That being said Bruce Boudreau would be my pick Todd McLellan as secondary. Boudreau hits the above criteria and generally fosters an environment where players can express themselves which is what I think Raymond Seider Ed Kasper all will need not this uber-focus on 200 foot game. He's not the guy to win you a Stanley Cup or even a few playoff series but his teams are able to sustain success AFTER HE LEAVES which should also be a good point to note.
detroitredwings,lxljdg3,2024-11-17 09:44:31,Any coach that want us to have some kind of offense. Goals...or even some shots ffs
detroitredwings,lxlxpic,2024-11-17 11:09:08,I’d prefer Jon Cooper. I’m sure Steve could sell him on taking this club from the bottom to the top . Coop loves a challenge .
detroitredwings,lxlygm7,2024-11-17 11:13:17,I met Gallant after he'd been let go by Vegas (before we hired Lalonde. I told him to call up Stevie y and get the bamd back together again.  I don't think he called.
detroitredwings,lxmau7a,2024-11-17 12:21:42,We need a coach who can speak and act with conviction. lalonde’s “I’m new” mentality and aura is not it. And the team gets nothing from it. If anything I bet they second guess EVERYTHING because of Lalonde. Pure speculation obviously but as a fan I’ve been tired of hearing Lalonde speak for 2 years now.
detroitredwings,lxmmesc,2024-11-17 13:25:00,What about Dan Watson? And if not him then pay Paul Maurice and/ or Florida whatever it takes to get him from the Panthers
detroitredwings,lxmw6xd,2024-11-17 14:15:49,We need to do something. This is getting hard to watch. I don't even want to waste my time going down to LCA to see this product feels like a big step back this year
detroitredwings,lxn8bi1,2024-11-17 15:21:28,If we hire Quenneville I'll be incredibly disappointed. I will stop being a fan until he's fired
detroitredwings,lxnt38z,2024-11-17 17:13:21,I'd rather give Lalonde a lifetime unbreakable contract than have anything to do with that sexual assault-enabling piece of human garbage.Signing him as a coach will end my love of the Red Wings until he's gone and honestly I am not sure they could get it back. The lack of holding anyone involved to account is a dark spot on the NHL.
detroitredwings,lxnvcm5,2024-11-17 17:25:55,Gerard gallant
detroitredwings,lxohh6n,2024-11-17 19:33:34,I wouldn't mind Gallant. Played with Yzerman was one of my favorite Wings too. He'd definitely be better than what we've had
detroitredwings,lxov229,2024-11-17 20:55:58,Gallant 100%.
detroitredwings,lxpjsj6,2024-11-17 23:38:52,Did Lalonde get fired?
detroitredwings,lxq4nb5,2024-11-18 02:49:22,Who ever gets rid of this stupid dump the puck and have your power forwards (we really don't have any) retrieve it system  and try to go to a possession system I'm good with.  You can literally see  some of the frustration from the players playing Lalonde's system (looking at Kane).
detroitredwings,lxnhbws,2024-11-17 16:08:57,Get Quinneville the fuck off of my screen
detroitredwings,lxk6ttn,2024-11-17 02:04:34,What is Lalonde’s winning percentage?
detroitredwings,lxllhzq,2024-11-17 09:57:55,Fuck Quennville.
detroitredwings,lxknwln,2024-11-17 05:11:02,This is getting so annoying
detroitredwings,lxlfhe0,2024-11-17 09:18:46,Gallant is our guy. He’s like a trampoline. Every team jumps higher after a gallant stint
detroitredwings,lxlfbs5,2024-11-17 09:17:43,funny how everyone is like i'll stop being a fan if Q is hired but somehow ok with Kane being on the team. because in hindsight they should have passed on Kane and Terasenko and kept Ghost and Wallman.
detroitredwings,lxl4tba,2024-11-17 08:00:41,What are they going to do to address the defense first?
detroitredwings,lxlx6a4,2024-11-17 11:06:12,Todd Nelson ?
detroitredwings,lxlxy8n,2024-11-17 11:10:27,No McLellan please . Starts off fast and dies off faster
detroitredwings,lxm318f,2024-11-17 11:38:30,"The hell kind of word is ""Winnigest""..."
detroitredwings,lxmqqfx,2024-11-17 13:47:24,Spud plz
detroitredwings,lxmv4fs,2024-11-17 14:10:14,Think Sergei would do it?
detroitredwings,lxmyy6i,2024-11-17 14:30:30,None of the above thanks. Don't take that to mean I want to keep Lalonde because they should have shitcanned him in the offseason.
detroitredwings,lxn81vg,2024-11-17 15:20:05,I’m a heavy no vote on the coaching carousel. Get some fresh ideas in there please
detroitredwings,lxo2sqt,2024-11-17 18:08:23,Andy Murray has a proven track record developing young players. I’d give him a call.
detroitredwings,lxoktgu,2024-11-17 19:53:21,Fedorov
detroitredwings,lxop8u0,2024-11-17 20:20:17,How many coaches does this GM get to choose?
detroitredwings,lxqv6c3,2024-11-18 07:25:08,Anyone of them would be better than that clown LaLonde
detroitredwings,lxrz646,2024-11-18 11:30:38,Joel
detroitredwings,lxs1zxq,2024-11-18 11:45:03,Motor City Dan Cleary
detroitredwings,lxs3fyp,2024-11-18 11:52:21,Put Stevie behind the bench
detroitredwings,lxsny2k,2024-11-18 13:35:25,Todd right?
detroitredwings,lxlqind,2024-11-17 10:27:58,Obligatory fuck Q. But with  new coach I just hope they don’t force this defensive system to the point of suffocating offensive creativity. I know defense it’s important but they have too many skilled players that look like they’re being forced to abandon that side of their game… and it clearly isn’t working because we’re awful defensively lol.
detroitredwings,lxkomhm,2024-11-17 05:18:57,Bring back Scotty
detroitredwings,lxki0j6,2024-11-17 04:04:59,We missed the boat not hiring Chief.
detroitredwings,lxlc8uz,2024-11-17 08:56:09,Woodcroft won’t get you into the playoffs. The other 3 might.
detroitredwings,lxko0vh,2024-11-17 05:12:20,I don’t agree with all hubbub around replacing LaLonde. In my opinion you don’t do that *until* this team is ready to truly compete *and* it’s clear he’s not the man for the job. This year is the year to let our young guys grow and develop (Edvinsson Kasper Berggren).
detroitredwings,lxlzrz7,2024-11-17 11:20:38,Fuck Joel Quenville.
detroitredwings,lxm05hz,2024-11-17 11:22:43,Quennville PLEASE!!
detroitredwings,lxkaq99,2024-11-17 02:45:13,Gallant was who I hope they grabbed after Cassidy went to Vegas. Happy to see him work with this team if they can shed Lalonde. At least we'd see some passion.
detroitredwings,lxosidi,2024-11-17 20:40:20,Quenville is my first choice then Gallant.
detroitredwings,lxlk8r5,2024-11-17 09:50:05,Question: wasn’t it rumoured Q was kept out of the loop with the Kyle Beach thing ? Like management hid it from Q then after all the publicity Q and Beach met up and Q apologized to beach and now they talk regularly.
detroitredwings,lxmrp6z,2024-11-17 13:52:31,Jon cooper assistsnts; Quenville babcock Mike keenan Bill Peter's. Let's get everybody to hate us so much they forget to play hockey.  I don't know what I'm saying anymore I'm starting to check out. It's sad at this point. please red wings. Stop the terrible.
detroitredwings,lxllffc,2024-11-17 09:57:28,I actually think Quenneville would be the best candidate. Not just because of the Chicago history with Cat Kane and Gustafson but he’s a well tenured NHL HC. He had a history of being pretty good in his time.
detroitredwings,lxkwow5,2024-11-17 06:46:32,Which ones do Yzerman already know because he isn't hiring outside his circle.
detroitredwings,lxo5064,2024-11-17 18:21:24,Interesting…I must be an insensitive asshole…because I feel that Quennville deserves a second chance. Maybe I’m wrong. This interview with Q opened my mind to a chance for redemption. https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/cam-strick-podcast/id1481543060?i=1000651851009

detroitredwings,lxlcznh,2024-11-17 09:01:25,Can we fire Lalonde and the players.  People don’t like Lalonde’s systems and maybe that is part of the problem. But these players look so uninspired.  Debrincat Kane Larkin where you guys at?   And Tarasenko would rather skate right next to the puck-carrier than try and take the puck away.
detroitredwings,lxlt659,2024-11-17 10:43:19,If Larionov could finish the year as a trial I’d love it. If that’s a pipe dream then I want Bruce or Todd from this list. Then Gallant.
detroitredwings,lxkxkaf,2024-11-17 06:55:20,If it's not quenville then it's wrong
detroitredwings,lxk61n1,2024-11-17 01:56:52,Any of em
detroitredwings,lxl1vrv,2024-11-17 07:36:00,Gallant would be what this team needs
detroitredwings,lxlc6d7,2024-11-17 08:55:39,What are the chances of getting Larionov or Fedorov?
detroitredwings,lxluwd6,2024-11-17 10:53:15,Where’s Dan Campbell
detroitredwings,lxm71l0,2024-11-17 12:00:32,What about your GM? Yzerman has been at this for a while.
detroitredwings,lxlmy3v,2024-11-17 10:06:41,I would be open to anyIts painfully obvious we need a new voice in the room
detroitredwings,lxm7yz7,2024-11-17 12:05:42,Turk or Q only.  Unless we really want to back a Brinks truck up to David Carle’s house and take a flyer on him
detroitredwings,lxme36s,2024-11-17 12:39:43,Quennville McClellan Gallant in that order but would be happy with either 3. Pass on woodcroft.
detroitredwings,lxkfqhw,2024-11-17 03:39:48,Can Dan Cambell coach two teams at once? I just want to see him on skates at a practice taking a scrimmage with the guys to get them fired up. Imagine a Dan Cambell on skates? I say we make it happen. In all seriousness though it needs to be Gallant.
detroitredwings,lxkwy8y,2024-11-17 06:49:12,Gallant was the one I wanted when we got rid of Blash. I don’t know if he can fix the inherent problems of the team but he’s got the experience and played for the wings back in the day. Couldn’t be worse than this shitshow
detroitredwings,lxkcsy5,2024-11-17 03:07:30,Crows supporter ?
detroitredwings,lxmoyo8,2024-11-17 13:38:18,Seriously. We don’t need to make a coach in a rebuild. Grab the Bowman and run.
detroitredwings,lxoyvus,2024-11-17 21:19:39,Pregame Speech for the Detroit Red WingsAlright team gather around. Tonight is not just another game; it’s a chance to define who we are. We wear the winged wheel a symbol of pride history and resilience. Each of you has fought hard to earn the right to wear this jersey and tonight it’s time to show everyone what that means.Look around you. These are your brothers. You’ve trained together sweat together and faced adversity together. You’ve pushed each other to be better every single day. Remember that feeling of coming together as a unit the bond that makes us stronger than any individual talent on this ice. Tonight we are not just playing for ourselves; we are playing for the fans who live and breathe Red Wings hockey. We are playing for the legends who came before us and laid the foundation of this franchise. We are playing for every kid who dreams of lacing up their skates and stepping onto this ice one day. We owe it to them to leave everything we have out there.When the puck drops I want you to play with heart. Play with passion. Leave your fears at the door and embrace the challenge. Remember it’s not about winning or losing; it’s about how we play the game. It’s about giving your all for your teammates and for the crest on your chest. Focus on the fundamentals stick to our game plan and communicate. Trust in each other and believe in the system we’ve built. When the going gets tough dig deep and pull together. In those moments it’s the strength of our bond that will carry us through.Let’s make this a game to remember. Let’s show everyone that the spirit of the Red Wings is alive and well. Play like every shift matters because tonight it does. Let’s take that ice and leave it all out there. Now let’s go out there and show them what we’re made of! Who’s with me? Let’s get this win! Go Wings!
detroitredwings,lxkwm6n,2024-11-17 06:45:45,![gif](giphy|88iYsvbegSUn9bSTF8)This got me
detroitredwings,lxl6ac7,2024-11-17 08:12:05,Pretty sure that lined up last time with Blashill leaving too. Coop ain’t coming here
detroitredwings,lxn7rou,2024-11-17 15:18:32,I could see that happening. Tampa is about to start a rebuild doubt Cooper wants to stick around for that.
detroitredwings,lxl1c5m,2024-11-17 07:31:08,that is to late.
detroitredwings,lxos0iv,2024-11-17 20:37:16,Cooper was extended already for a year - his contract runs through 25-26 not this year.
detroitredwings,lxlpmjr,2024-11-17 10:22:43,Cooper can go wherever he wants and name his price. He's not gonna sign on to a team with as little promise as Detroit when he could be going to a team with a clear path to contention.
detroitredwings,lxkjbq0,2024-11-17 04:19:40,Maybe give McLellan an opportunity to finish out the season an audition to see how well the team responds to him and if he can get them back on track. If he does well keep til he gives you a reason not too. I truly feel that Lalonde has lost the room and while it seems he’s trying to be AJ Hinch as far as using stats data and the like Hinch is genuinely charismatic and has the pedigree and resume to make players he manages believe and trust in what he has to say to them either the players are playing Lalonde’s system and demonstrating why it should be abandoned or more damning they’re going through the motions and only giving a little effort. I can’t see Larkin doing the latter and he leads this team to inth point. That means to me at least that Lalonde’s system is the culprit as to why we’re failing.
detroitredwings,lxl79hh,2024-11-17 08:19:39,The way I understand it Larionov preaches the old Soviet style of constant motion good passing and teamwork. It's an unselfish system and would require several years to fully implement. It is a much different approach to the game than most kids are used to- especially the North American players.I wouldn't expect results real quick. It could work 2ell with younger players willing to relearn the game and buy into it. It certainly doesn't work when the GM replaces 25-30% of the personnel every year as Stevie has done every year since he arrived.
detroitredwings,lxkxuep,2024-11-17 06:58:10,I gave a thumbs up because thats who I've been calling for the last 2-3 years.  It's who I wanted when Blashill was let go.  Unfortunately I cant see it happening right now.   Larionov signed a new contract in the summer.   I think we'll have to wait another 2-3 years before it becomes remotely possible so we're maybe looking for a stopgap until then......unless you want to carry on with Lalonde for the next few years (yikes).
detroitredwings,lxl8rmy,2024-11-17 08:30:52,I would take this over any other candidate. He’s incredibly smart and smart enough to lead the team properly. He has Soviet hockey pedigree. He’s perfect.
detroitredwings,lxosyei,2024-11-17 20:43:03,I’d absolutely take Larionov over anyone and I suspect he’d be willing to choose us over anyone if it were to happen (he reportedly turned teams down this summer). I think it would be tougher to get him here though since he coaches a team close to his heart and he said his highest commitment is to seeing their project through. I think there’s a case for Fedorov too. Larionov would definitely be preferable but I think Sergei would be phenomenal as well.
detroitredwings,lxkkiql,2024-11-17 04:33:05,I mean I’m not a big Boys Club guy but I’d be willing to give him a look I guess. As far as I’m aware he’s done pretty well in the KHL
detroitredwings,lxlev9n,2024-11-17 09:14:33,For real. Glad most of the comments seem to be on the same page. This seems like OP trying to soft launch that Q is an option we should consider and that's a dogshit take if that's the case. If we did that I'd just stop watching. I followed the Kyle Beach situation very closely and it was genuinely fucking heartbreaking. Coach Q needs to stay gone.
detroitredwings,lxloh8t,2024-11-17 10:15:54,100% agree it would be beyond shameful to hire this man.
detroitredwings,lxstiok,2024-11-18 14:03:16,That’s your best option though.
detroitredwings,lxnkt9o,2024-11-17 16:27:57,"I'm not a fan of Todd. But Gallant/Woodcroft I'd be ""fine"" with for finishing the season."
detroitredwings,lxl1hur,2024-11-17 07:32:34,And fuck Bowman's son.
detroitredwings,lxl9ynp,2024-11-17 08:39:40,[deleted]
detroitredwings,lxkxbag,2024-11-17 06:52:52,I agree it says a lot about him but the organization itself wasn’t really punished for what happened. They were realistically rewarded with a generational talent. So I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised to see him with a head coaching job again. Especially how head coaches in the nhl are constantly recycled.
detroitredwings,lxser8d,2024-11-18 12:49:16,The poor call center employees shouldn't have to deal with him either tho.
detroitredwings,lxlda38,2024-11-17 09:03:28,I've been shouting Boudreau from the rooftops the entire time. He's a proven winner at the NHL level and the man actually has some *passion* behind the bench.
detroitredwings,lxlhca7,2024-11-17 09:31:15,Woodcraft is a weird one to me. He took over a half season with Edmonton and got them 55 points in 38 games and went to the conference finals.  Second season was goodThird season disastrous start. Which with that roster it’s gotta be harder to coach them to a losing record than it is to fall backwards into the playoffs. Someone will take a swing on him but it’s risky. Boudreau would be wonderful
detroitredwings,lxly68v,2024-11-17 11:11:42,Boudreau would be a cool hire. It’d be fun to see what he could bring out in Raymond. He also might be a the kind of guy who could get Kasper to explore his offensive potential more.
detroitredwings,lxmxs3r,2024-11-17 14:24:10,"Which prospects did Gallant fuck up?  Lefreniere and Kappo?  They were 2nd and 3rd year players for Gallant respectively not really prospects and simply aren't anywhere near the hype they were billed to be.  They tried playing them on the 1st and 2nd lines their rookie year and Gallant did too they couldn't score and were getting burned.  That had nothing to do with Gallant.  Gallant played a ton of young players and none have improved much since he left.  I don't get this argument at all it sounds like NYR fan delusion that spread to Detroit for some reason.""Lefreniere and Kappo might make an all star game or 2 but if they were never coached by Gallant they'd be first ballot hall of famers.""  Lol.  Random NYR fans and Red Wings fans on Reddit."
detroitredwings,lxlg5ex,2024-11-17 09:23:17,Tanguay is an issue as well in my opinion. Sure he runs the PP but.. he also runs the PK which is notoriously awful. I’d rather clear house and get rid of anyone associated with this current shit show.
detroitredwings,lxl1lo6,2024-11-17 07:33:31,Tanguay interim is my pick.
detroitredwings,lxk8dsu,2024-11-17 02:20:25,Colton?
detroitredwings,lxlflkk,2024-11-17 09:19:34,>Martin St. LouisAlmost certainly a no after Yzerman left him of the initial team Canada roster in 2014
detroitredwings,lxoy8yy,2024-11-17 21:15:43,Larkin too at some point.  Lalonde and if nothing changes I wonder if Larkin ends up on the block as well.
detroitredwings,lxkvx3j,2024-11-17 06:38:34,Yeah same. Whichever team ends up picking Q fucks up big time.
detroitredwings,lxkoih3,2024-11-17 05:17:42,If he does I will gladly welcome you to the Kings… I would say give TMac a shot again. I hated the way the Kings let him go.
detroitredwings,lxlrxiv,2024-11-17 10:36:14,With such a low end roster already this team needs to tank for a shot at 1OA or we will be middling for another decade if not more. The top talent coming up these days is on another planet compared to even 5-10 years ago. I'd bet both the Sharks and Hawks will be contenders before the Wings will.
detroitredwings,lxk84ws,2024-11-17 02:17:54,I agree with this. If only there some way to like vote on your comment to make it go up.
detroitredwings,lxkhlc2,2024-11-17 04:00:19,Don't live what he did with Laf tho.
detroitredwings,lxl114h,2024-11-17 07:28:23,I wouldn't want him.  I completely moved on when Edmonton went on that heater.  I went from not knowing Knoblauch to rooting for him in the finals all in seven months.
detroitredwings,lxkkffb,2024-11-17 04:32:02,Hockey is a team sport not a two player sport.
detroitredwings,lxl14h8,2024-11-17 07:29:14,I called for him when Quinn got canned.  That guy is definitely not NHL material.
detroitredwings,lxk95do,2024-11-17 02:28:23,That’s not a reliable stat for head coach legitimacy. For example Paul Maurice is a career .511
detroitredwings,lxk7ko1,2024-11-17 02:12:07,.517
detroitredwings,lxlquhy,2024-11-17 10:29:54,Disgusting
detroitredwings,lxmefqf,2024-11-17 12:41:40,He 100% would be but this is Reddit so you wont get many who agree here.
detroitredwings,lxld41l,2024-11-17 09:02:17,He and Gallant were linemates in the old days. McClellan was an assistant with the Wings.
detroitredwings,lxl2ixm,2024-11-17 07:41:43,Why is it that across Reddit when I see the red helmet avatar I have to brace myself for an awful take
detroitredwings,lxlszds,2024-11-17 10:42:15,Hopefully zero. It’s too much of a boys club now
detroitredwings,lxl35yg,2024-11-17 07:47:06,Doesn’t Gallant have a track record of being bad with rookies? Wings currently have 3 in the lineup and will potentially have 2 next season with Cossa Danielson and/or another young defenseman in GR. ASP and MBN would need a year in GR I’m assuming before they make the team.
detroitredwings,lxkhox2,2024-11-17 04:01:25,Unexpected AFL reference.
detroitredwings,lxm7o8v,2024-11-17 12:04:03,What makes you think he will never come?
detroitredwings,lxow2if,2024-11-17 21:02:11,We might have to start another rebuild too
detroitredwings,lxnv7l7,2024-11-17 17:25:08,Why do you think they are going to start a rebuild?
detroitredwings,lxoifbj,2024-11-17 19:39:08,I mean… there’s a chance we will be rebuilding the rebuild at the same time. So I’m not sure that’s very appealing to one of the best coaches ever.
detroitredwings,lxm7pun,2024-11-17 12:04:17,Did he die?
detroitredwings,lxou3gv,2024-11-17 20:50:06,Same with Lalonde.
detroitredwings,lxm8gpr,2024-11-17 12:08:25,I think scotty Bowman could've also done that too. But for some reason he came to Detroit. Must've been magic or something because it has to be impossible for a good coach to come to Detroit.
detroitredwings,lxkk6gm,2024-11-17 04:29:15,McLellan is a Babcock disciple. I wouldn't want to touch him with a twenty foot pole.
detroitredwings,lxptwge,2024-11-18 01:01:41,Maclellan is not what this team needs.  It needs a young coach who pisses excellence and demands the same…  but also who can teach coach and inspire
detroitredwings,lxnujzu,2024-11-17 17:21:31,"I doubt it would take several years. These are incredibly talented players that can adapt to a system. The problem at the moment is that the system sucks. We may lose this year but honestly it's starting to look like this year is lost anyway (I still have hope but yikes).On the other hand Larionov is one of my favourite Wings ever and I don't want his legacy tarnished by failing to win as a coach here. I'd take him though there is a reason he is called The ProfessorEdit: Also that ""constant motion"" is exactly the style of hockey I want to see them play. This north/south game is so boring. I'd take low event hockey if that hockey is even close to the joy of watching the Russian 5 move the puck"
detroitredwings,lxldmkh,2024-11-17 09:05:55,Few people know the game as well as he does.  I’d be interested to see what he can do.
detroitredwings,lxkxzsj,2024-11-17 06:59:39,Not only has he done well in the KHL but he's done it with a young developing team which in the next couple / few years is what we're about to become.   He would be a good appointment just on that basis.
detroitredwings,lxnnypy,2024-11-17 16:45:11,Q isn’t my optionSo don’t be putting words in my mouth
detroitredwings,lxletyd,2024-11-17 09:14:18,I came from the Blackhawks to the Red Wings to abandon that organization after what happened. If they brought Q to Detroit I’d just stop watching hockey.
detroitredwings,lxlfivl,2024-11-17 09:19:03,Same here. I've watched all throughout Wheel Team Bad era here on Reddit and I'm excited for the day that we really start to realize some potential. I'd be completely done. The Kyle Beach thing is bigger than hockey.
detroitredwings,lxlk8kw,2024-11-17 09:50:03,So many here were saying this when there were Kane rumors only to turn around and love him here
detroitredwings,lxl6ahw,2024-11-17 08:12:07,The fact that Quenneville is 66 hasn’t coached in three years and hasn’t won a playoff series in nine well…The whole situation in Chicago is an immediate marker that he can’t prioritize effectively emotionally regulate or be responsible for his players. Detroit or otherwise shouldn’t accept that.
detroitredwings,lxlq028,2024-11-17 10:24:56,Better not be here
detroitredwings,lxlz7qt,2024-11-17 11:17:31,what happened?

detroitredwings,lxmy84z,2024-11-17 14:26:34,Does he have any gas left in his tank he'd be the oldest active coach one of the oldest in history as well.
detroitredwings,lxlp8ki,2024-11-17 10:20:24,Boughner runs PK and the D.
detroitredwings,lxlmulu,2024-11-17 10:06:05,We have the absolute worst defense in the league and our forward group outside of Larkin Raymond and Copp are not good defensively. I wouldn’t put too much of that on Tanguay for the bad PK.
detroitredwings,lxk8u37,2024-11-17 02:25:08,Fuck thanks for that. Fixed. I'm not sure why I saw Woodcroft and my brain said Colton. Too much late night trama over the last two days I guess.
detroitredwings,lxk9n3d,2024-11-17 02:33:37,Coopers contract ends this year rigggghhhttt
detroitredwings,lxlsn62,2024-11-17 10:40:18,Great point.
detroitredwings,lxmterc,2024-11-17 14:01:22,What did he do with Laf? Stevie x Drouin type situation?
detroitredwings,lxlf1h1,2024-11-17 09:15:45,Woodcroft was fired in the same season his team was two goals away from the cup.
detroitredwings,lxlixnk,2024-11-17 09:41:42,.535 .511 is the playoff win percentage.
detroitredwings,lxnd5lu,2024-11-17 15:47:21,I’m missing something aren’t I? Was he involved in the whole Blackhawks scandal a few years back? If so I retract lol he may be a shitbag but he had good teams
detroitredwings,lxmpgiy,2024-11-17 13:40:54,[deleted]
detroitredwings,lxnjxoo,2024-11-17 16:23:09,He's got a short leash with rookies. Lafreniere was given basically 13ish minutes of ice time and kept getting relegated to the 4th line. Meanwhile his linemates were a jumbled mess of Kakko Chytil but also....Barclay Goodrow? Ryan Carpenter? Sammy Blais? Dryden Hunt?I remember he notoriously scratched Kakko in the Devils series for Hunt and everyone was like the fuck?
detroitredwings,lxl48y8,2024-11-17 07:56:09,Yeah this is true. He could be a short term stop gap I guess but idk. I’m just tired boss
detroitredwings,lxkhqxt,2024-11-17 04:02:03,Random huh
detroitredwings,lxptlvm,2024-11-18 00:58:58,Weather sucks.
detroitredwings,lxoubvz,2024-11-17 20:51:30,No Lalonde never received a year extension. He is in the final year of his contract.
detroitredwings,lxmauvs,2024-11-17 12:21:48,Yea when bowman came to Detroit the red wings were a playoff team and trying to win a Stanley cup. These red wings are just trying to win a game… any game.
detroitredwings,lxm97uz,2024-11-17 12:12:38,?? Not remotely comparable.Bowman joined the Wings in 1993 when we had Yzerman Coffey Fedorov Lidstrom Konstantinov etc etc. The path to Cup contender status was clear.
detroitredwings,lxl1g0p,2024-11-17 07:32:08,Woodcroft was there too.  So Gallant it is.
detroitredwings,lxnwxzo,2024-11-17 17:34:47,"Huh if only there was a way for you to clarify what your pick would be for the sake of discussion...Nope your only choice was to post a graphic that includes Q which clearly shows Q as the strongest contender on paper - ""2nd winningest coach in history"" and your super mysterious ""I know who my choice would be..."" and leaving it wide open to interpretation. This post has very strong '2009 Facebook girl posting about her crush' energy.So next time clarify your stance when you start a discussion that includes something controversial or dont act surprised when people fill in the blanks."
detroitredwings,lxlpnn8,2024-11-17 10:22:54,Respect.
detroitredwings,lxnneds,2024-11-17 16:42:07,You and me both. I jumped ship to the wings after the whole Kyle Beech stuff came to light. I can’t believe they had no real penalty to covering this up drafted first overall and Bowman somehow has another GM job. What in the actual hell.
detroitredwings,lxlxqu5,2024-11-17 11:09:20,Me too!
detroitredwings,lxk9dtb,2024-11-17 02:30:51,I was genuinely wondering if it was a nickname or something for Woody that I wasn't aware of. lol
detroitredwings,lxl1dm9,2024-11-17 07:31:31,He could get renewed.  Brind'Amour got five more years after losing to Gallant's successor.
detroitredwings,lxnpdri,2024-11-17 16:52:58,Laf basically had shit linemates his whole tenure with Gallant as coach and regularly would get demoted to the 4th/3rd line. Gallant basically gave him 13 minutes a night and no PP time.Kakko got similar treatment Kakko has amazing possession numbers but can't finish to save his life so in the Devils series in 22-23 or whenever it was Gallant scratched him for fucking Dryden Hunt and people still don't know why.
detroitredwings,lxm46dw,2024-11-17 11:44:46,I went back and my source actually says .537 for regular season but the point still stands. Going by his playoff win % he would be a “bad” coach
detroitredwings,lxnfy1l,2024-11-17 16:01:38,On October 26 2021 an independent investigation into how the Blackhawks responded to claims that former video coach Brad Aldrich sexually assaulted prospect Kyle Beach during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs revealed that Quenneville as well as the several members of the Blackhawks’ senior leadership team opted to defer any action on Aldrich until after the Stanley Cup Finals.According to the report Quenneville was particularly concerned about causing a distraction before the Finals. Three weeks after the allegations were raised Aldrich was forced to resign by HR and Legal after opting not to comply with their investigation and subsequently pleaded guilty to assaulting a player at a Michigan high school where he was a volunteer coach.[12]Quenneville had previously claimed he had no knowledge that Aldrich sexually assaulted anyone before Beach and the high school player sued the Blackhawks[13] but multiple witnesses stated that he was called into a meeting to discuss the Aldrich matter shortly after the Blackhawks defeated the Sharks to advance to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals.[14] Multiple people in the meeting claimed that the matter discussed did not directly involve sexual assault and then-CEO John McDonough in the meeting committed to getting more information and handling the matter while directing Quenneville and the rest of senior management to keep their focus on the upcoming Stanley Cup Finals.[15]On October 27 2021 Quenneville was summoned to a meeting the following day with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman to discuss his role in the incident.[16] Within hours of that meeting Quenneville announced his immediate resignation as Panthers coach.
detroitredwings,lxmxqki,2024-11-17 14:23:56,Same excuses people gave for why Babcock should be given another chance (who also inherited a winning team). And guess how that went??You go ahead and be morally bankrupt I’m not going to stop you. And I’m sure in this league Q will get another chance at some point. I can still advocate against it though.
detroitredwings,lxlycin,2024-11-17 11:12:40,Yeah I don’t have the answers either. I agree that they are in need of new leadership though.
detroitredwings,lxouyts,2024-11-17 20:55:24,Oh well I was wrong guess we have to extend him one year if we wanted to go down that path.
detroitredwings,lxmbsyp,2024-11-17 12:27:01,So you think people don't respect wanting to work for our management? Some people enjoy the challenge.
detroitredwings,lxmbfo7,2024-11-17 12:24:58,"We still have Yzerman lol. ""Not remotely close"""
detroitredwings,lxl7gnt,2024-11-17 08:21:10,Woodcroft was the video guy and is known as a personable coach.
detroitredwings,lxnzbxs,2024-11-17 17:48:30,he’s a great coach and he’s better than any coach out there. he’s made egregious mistakes that nobody wants on a team but i mean who tf else would you put there? he’s an option. calm down kid stop being so soft.
detroitredwings,lxmfyv4,2024-11-17 12:50:09,AbsolutelyEdit: oh I think I know where my math may have faltered I added up the numbers off of Wikipedia which didn’t include this seasons games.
detroitredwings,lxmyft0,2024-11-17 14:27:44,Also he hasn’t made amends. He was hired by minor league teams to LEAD trainings about safe practices. The biggest joke ever.
detroitredwings,lxp2p95,2024-11-17 21:43:21,Good God please not another year. 
detroitredwings,lxmd7t9,2024-11-17 12:34:52,Yea maybe a coach who has something to prove But no Stanley cup coach is coming to take over a team just for the challenge. Bottom line is money talks and maybe management is the problem.
detroitredwings,lxmgr5h,2024-11-17 12:54:28,Can't tell if you're just trolling at this point or really can't see the difference between the 1993 Wings and the 2024 Wings.
detroitredwings,lxohjzb,2024-11-17 19:34:01,My issue isn't that Q is an option on the list. My issue is that OP posted a list where Q is clearly painted as the best choice and then gets all pissy when based on the title people are assuming that OP wants Q as the coach. So when people start talking about how much of a shit stain on the org it would be Q got hired OP is going to play the I *technically* DiDnT AcTuaLly SpEciFy WhO I WoUlD pIcK  game. Fuck off. Also nobody is saying coach Q isn't a great coach from a pure hockey perspective. It's just you know the part of being a coach where you should probably advocate for your players if they get r*ped. But hey that's just the opinion of a softie I guess. If you don't understand what someone is saying or the point they're making you can and should read it a few more times.
detroitredwings,lxp3qsv,2024-11-17 21:49:45,I'm strapped into the ride at this point.
detroitredwings,lxmgx3l,2024-11-17 12:55:21,Okay but does Yzerman help us land Cooper more than not having him?
detroitredwings,lxmhjsv,2024-11-17 12:58:49,Probably but that doesn't mean we're anywhere near the most desirable destruction
detroitredwings,lxoimww,2024-11-17 19:40:22,At this point having Yzerman is a hindrance to having a functional hockey team so no it doesn’t help.
detroitredwings,lxmiej4,2024-11-17 13:03:28,We got money and management you're saying it's roster construction holding us back? Doesn't that excuse Lalonde?
detroitredwings,lxotid4,2024-11-17 20:46:28,What is he supposed to do? Sign hockey players and coaches that are under contract from another team? What kind of cracker jack take is that? Sounds like you don't know anything.
detroitredwings,lxmt9v6,2024-11-17 14:00:40,It might excuse Lalonde a bit but it doesn't make the situation attractive for a new coach. Why choose to try to make a contender out of a mediocre team instead of trying to win a Cup with a strong roster?

detroitredwings,lxjhjva,2024-11-16 22:38:58,Hey at least Talbot had a .927 save percentage. 
detroitredwings,lxji313,2024-11-16 22:42:30,I won’t even get into the whole game just the last portion. If your best player and captain is calling for a timeout after scoring and is gassed then you call that timeout. Get Larkin back on the ice and try and win the faceoff at center ice and go again. You only have 1.5 mins and are down 2. Why save a timeout? Also Gus not skating hard there for that icing to save some seconds is the epitome of the hustle this team is plagued with.
detroitredwings,lxjhq67,2024-11-16 22:40:09,“Call a timeout?  What you think it’s a magical spell that can score goals?  Are you stupid?”Leave Derek’s baldass head in LA please.
detroitredwings,lxji07s,2024-11-16 22:42:00,Seeing Larkin signal for a timeout and clearly being shut down is really concerning
detroitredwings,lxjicno,2024-11-16 22:44:18,https://i.redd.it/7osgop2bvd1e1.gifCall a player's only meeting. This is just sad.
detroitredwings,lxjucmf,2024-11-17 00:14:54,I am so fucking sick of Lalonde and his god damn analytics. Direct quote:“Yeah zone time didn’t feel good yeah shots on goal discrepancy didn’t feel good but until the 3rd goal our analytics guy said chances were 10-8 so it was actually a close game”.Fuck you and your fucking analytics guy.

detroitredwings,lxjhzsu,2024-11-16 22:41:56,Lalonde is the worst coach in the NHL and had absolutely zero to do with the Lightning winning two Cups. I wouldn't trust him to coach the Griffins.
detroitredwings,lxjhkvg,2024-11-16 22:39:10,Starting to grow disappointment in Yzerman. You cannot keep this coaching staff. Do something.

detroitredwings,lxji7vf,2024-11-16 22:43:24,Don't feel bad about wanting Lalonde gone. He is probably earning more per year than any of us will earn over a decade.Leave him in LA no one behind the bench is better than what is happening now. Hell if there is a rule saying you have to have one just grab any Wings fan in San Jose and make their year by letting them sit in his spot.
detroitredwings,lxjhkw8,2024-11-16 22:39:10,This team is an absolute fucking dumpster fire. How are we this fucking bad this far into the rebuild?
detroitredwings,lxjiqtp,2024-11-16 22:46:57,Walman is for sure scoring on the Wings

detroitredwings,lxjhs3q,2024-11-16 22:40:31,Am I crazy or do they not really show Lalonde on the bench during games as much as they used to
detroitredwings,lxjhske,2024-11-16 22:40:36,And suddenly the haters were right
detroitredwings,lxjkwu1,2024-11-16 23:02:08,This team has so obviously quit on Lalonde. Larkin needs to go to Yzerman and speak up and let him know what’s really going on. Lalonde needs to be gone after Monday regardless of the result.
detroitredwings,lxjhkwz,2024-11-16 22:39:10,Fire Der-rek chacha-chachacha  Fire Der-rek chacha-chachacha

detroitredwings,lxjhruc,2024-11-16 22:40:28,It’s unbelievable that we went from Walman/Ghost/Maatta to Holl/Gus/AlJo and lost draft capital in the process. Yzerman’s taking too many bong rips.

detroitredwings,lxjjfyc,2024-11-16 22:51:43,I thought the fire Newsy train last season was premature but I’ve watched every game so far this season and I’d say the wings played well in maybe 2-3 so far and have just gotten lucky goaltending in the other wins. If we lose in SJ on this trip he can’t stay man.

detroitredwings,lxjkfp8,2024-11-16 22:58:43,This is just hard to watch at this point.

detroitredwings,lxjkr01,2024-11-16 23:00:57,Well the Wings are the only team in the Eastern Conference rockin' a 2-game losing streak. Everyone else got at least a point in their last two games. So we got that going for us! And the way the Sharks looked against the Pens tonight we may run it up to three! My new conspiracy theory - keep Lalonde TANK and sell off players at the trade deadline. More draft capital and prospects! What else explains the craptastic reality of this team?!? This team is brutal.
detroitredwings,lxjlne7,2024-11-16 23:07:31,This is the most disappointing team I can remember especially after how they finished last year

detroitredwings,lxjjgl2,2024-11-16 22:51:50,Either Y cannot assemble a talented roster or Lalonde cannot extract the latent talent. Or maybe it’s both. Something needs to change. Not next season not next week but right now.

detroitredwings,lxjo0r1,2024-11-16 23:25:15,Lalonde must have at least a sliver of nerves with regard to the SJ game potentially being his last.
detroitredwings,lxjy9g2,2024-11-17 00:47:06,I didn't like Lalonde last year. I hate him this year
detroitredwings,lxjytzk,2024-11-17 00:51:42,As I was saying last season launch Lalonde into the fucking sun.
detroitredwings,lxjkj7b,2024-11-16 22:59:23,How are so many of you still blaming the players? They're being told by a useless clown to go out there and play dull low event hockey and to just roll over. D-Boss looks cooked and it's probably because he's over it.
detroitredwings,lxjmcyg,2024-11-16 23:12:48,Such a shame man. I really was looking forward to this year. Seems like no one cares. Fire lalonde immediately. Probably the worst head coach in the NHL right now. The whole team looks uninspired. We have way more talent then what we are seeing.
detroitredwings,lxjjq6p,2024-11-16 22:53:42,We don’t forcheck just to forcheck remember guys?

detroitredwings,lxjitjk,2024-11-16 22:47:28,It's a country club and it's Yzerman's fault.
detroitredwings,lxjk3pj,2024-11-16 22:56:22,Airlift Sergei out of Russia again and get him on as coach.
detroitredwings,lxjklvc,2024-11-16 22:59:56,Wow . 1st of all we still can’t outshoot our opponents. 2. Fire some coaches please cuz wtf is this.
detroitredwings,lxjmgiv,2024-11-16 23:13:32,I’m scared to type this but the pistons have a better winning percentage (42.3%) than the red wings (41.1%) which is just so depressing
detroitredwings,lxjo0mi,2024-11-16 23:25:14,Can anyone share how Lalonde spun this?
detroitredwings,lxjzigt,2024-11-17 00:57:25,I was expecting to take at least two of these games on this road trip. Now we’re looking like we are getting NO points this trip. And that’s embarrassing.We are supposed to be better than this. We are expected to be better than this. Prepared to watch Celebrini dance circles around us Monday night. This has been such a let down of a season. We are not making the playoffs. This team is not a St Louis miracle team. There’s so much blame to be passed around. But the harshest reality is Lalonde has been soooo bad that he’s got us longing for Blashill. Now I was never a blash hater and recognized the shit hand he was dealt. But watching a much more talented roster look flatter and less exciting than the beer league team Blash had to work with is very concerning.Something needs to change. The excitement is getting coached out of our best young players and it’s hard to watch. Where did Seider’s rookie year aggression go!? Where is it Lalonde!?
detroitredwings,lxjiolj,2024-11-16 22:46:32,The way this team plays hockey is fundamentally objectively the wrong way to play hockey and Lalonde needs to pull off some Jack Adams worthy changes if he wants to stay here.

detroitredwings,lxjhxdp,2024-11-16 22:41:29,Well that was a bummer
detroitredwings,lxji296,2024-11-16 22:42:21,Watch my whl tonight was definitely the right call
detroitredwings,lxjlu17,2024-11-16 23:08:52,Can anyone explain to me what is going on?  Why do we look so lethargic and can only manage about 15 SOG? What happened to the really good offensive team that we had last year?
detroitredwings,lxjq8e3,2024-11-16 23:42:28,I took a nice nap and it looks like I didn't miss much. 26th in the league now is a big yikes. 
detroitredwings,lxk7879,2024-11-17 02:08:34,Getting outshot this badly almost every game — something is broken
detroitredwings,lxjiys0,2024-11-16 22:48:26,Ugh.

detroitredwings,lxjww4b,2024-11-17 00:36:08,This is not going to be a very fun season is it.
detroitredwings,lxjldr9,2024-11-16 23:05:32,Steve was there.He watched them do nothing.He doesn’t care. 
detroitredwings,lxjj3ix,2024-11-16 22:49:18,Wings will finally draft first and the guy is gonna suck
detroitredwings,lxjmnao,2024-11-16 23:14:55,Who would have thought last year at this point the pistons would be the most exciting team at LCA
detroitredwings,lxjyq6z,2024-11-17 00:50:50,I would rather bring back Blashill than have this bald uncle fester looking dumbass coach us into the ground
detroitredwings,lxjqd3w,2024-11-16 23:43:28,Saggin for Hagens
detroitredwings,lxjvdfq,2024-11-17 00:23:25,If we go 0-3 on this west coast trip with two of those teams being the absolute bottom of the barrel I am all for a coaching change. It’s time. We’re still a couple years minimum away from contracts expiring and prospects coming up but something needs to change to make this season even bearable. Larkin wanting the TO and not getting it sort of solidifies a need for change short term.
detroitredwings,lxk4rt8,2024-11-17 01:44:27,I’m sure Lalonde will come out in a press conference and not take accountability. I love you Yzerman and if you wont hold Lalonde accountable then 
detroitredwings,lxkoqzf,2024-11-17 05:20:21,I didn't realize red was the opposite of Honolulu blue
detroitredwings,lxksqs3,2024-11-17 06:04:27,wHeRe ArE aLl ThE dOoMeRs NoW?I’ve said since July this team would be ass so I’ll take your upvotes now.
detroitredwings,lxk5pn1,2024-11-17 01:53:35,Kings fan here… Redwings are my #2 team.  If you want a turn around have Daryl Sutter coach the team… I was supposed to be at the game tonight but I gave my tickets to a good friend of mine. And he was able to take his wife and daughter to their first game. They all loved it. Hope the Wings turn their season around soon. Because losing to the Quacks the night before …. Ouch
detroitredwings,lxjxau8,2024-11-17 00:39:30,Only exciting top to bottom good game this season was NJD at home. We played physical and dominated the shit out of a very good team. Then I think Larkin and Kane both said in interviews something to the effect of we played physical but we don’t want to play that kind of game. Why the fuck not? The best teams dominate by setting the tone of the game physically. Protects our skilled guys. Shuts down the skilled lines on the other side. Makes the opponent play on their heels. I don’t understand why we’re so hesitant to play that way when we have the roster to do it (Fish Raz Mo Chiarot). I absolutely love Newsy and I have never been on the fire Newsy train but if we don’t absolutely beat the living hell out of San Jose and have a 5-1 or 6-2 win there he’s gotta go. And even if we do have that if we end November still at/under .500 we have to fire him because the season is still thankfully salvageable. Like despite the awful games we do still have a decent shot at the playoffs because the Atlantic has stayed so tight.Edit to add someone else here mentioned Larkin calling for the timeout and coach not calling it. That sucks man. That’s just some bullshit. Whether or not it has any effect at all have your captain’s back.
detroitredwings,lxji9oa,2024-11-16 22:43:45,Watching some Michael Misa highlights kind of takes the sting off
detroitredwings,lxjl7ce,2024-11-16 23:04:14,Hey they deleted all those garbage posts from the sub feed. Now delete Lalonde from the payroll.
detroitredwings,lxjyqs3,2024-11-17 00:50:58,"Didn't catch game. Did Lalonde just decide to go straight turtle from the start this time?  ""Why wait for the lead we can turtle now!"""
detroitredwings,lxk3qug,2024-11-17 01:35:00,Mann
detroitredwings,lxl5hg6,2024-11-17 08:05:48,Didn't watch. Thank god. 18 shots? And the coach won't take a TO with the captain asking for it? Let's just throw an octopus into the bench and let it coach the Wings—I guarantee we'd see some improvement.
detroitredwings,lxll4nd,2024-11-17 09:55:36,Stevie what’s it gonna take for Lalonde to get fired? In all honesty what the fuck is it gonna take??
detroitredwings,lxlnd2y,2024-11-17 10:09:12,On one hand we played llike we were tired and lost. We were outshot 3:1 until the third and it was only 2:1. We didn't get a 10th SOG until 32 minutes.On the otherhand we're aiming for the bottom again and Yzerman might be awarded a 1st pick eventually. We are after all one of 3 teams with the longest draft drought. Also Talbot was great and has been our most consistent goalie this season.
detroitredwings,lxlotub,2024-11-17 10:17:59,I hate this team. 
detroitredwings,lxlqz5z,2024-11-17 10:30:40,"Why aren't American supporters like European supporters? Bring a big fucking banner that says ""Fire uncle Fester!"" Start a rant like why are you guys so dull? ..https://youtu.be/MFjfghF-qYE?si=vdXb3pJP8GTX5spP"
detroitredwings,lxlww1w,2024-11-17 11:04:37,Larkin calling for a timeout Lalonde not calling it screams the level of discontent in the dressing room and explains why Noosey has lost the locker room and needs to go
detroitredwings,lxjl5js,2024-11-16 23:03:53,Is it me or is Lalondes nose getting bigger?
detroitredwings,lxjnceq,2024-11-16 23:20:05,Huge LOL to everyone who thinks a coaching change would make an impactful difference this season. This roster blows and there is only one person to blame for that. Sure switch out Newsy best we are is a borderline playoff team that still misses the playoffs like last year.
detroitredwings,lxji19a,2024-11-16 22:42:11,This sub is honestly worse than the on ice product.
detroitredwings,lxjk3pd,2024-11-16 22:56:22,At least Boston is bad there's a playoff spot for one of these teams.
detroitredwings,lxjhrid,2024-11-16 22:40:24,They are way better than us
detroitredwings,lxjiam5,2024-11-16 22:43:56,OTT makes it to the playoffs at least
detroitredwings,lxjhzfm,2024-11-16 22:41:52,Uhh those teams are much better
detroitredwings,lxjlami,2024-11-16 23:04:53,I claim this as today's moral victory.
detroitredwings,lxjthj8,2024-11-17 00:07:41,Him Larkin Raymond Kasper and Ed are about the only bright spots this season so far.
detroitredwings,lxjicp2,2024-11-16 22:44:19,Lalonde’s the worst game manager I’ve seen in a long ass time. How do you not call a timeout when your team’s captain is begging for one?If he’s not incompetent then he’s maliciously sabotaging his own team’s efforts.  Either way it’s bad.
detroitredwings,lxjycu4,2024-11-17 00:47:50,Larkin's back must be so hurt from carrying the team alone for years
detroitredwings,lxjipip,2024-11-16 22:46:43,The fact he never uses his timeouts baffles me. It’s a free advantage to your team and he just never uses it 99 percent of the time…
detroitredwings,lxjji8w,2024-11-16 22:52:09,Seeing Larkin clearly calling for a TO and being told no is some BS
detroitredwings,lxkv1dm,2024-11-17 06:29:18,He didn't call one in last year's San Jose game when we kept giving up short handed goals and blew a 5 goal lead in record time. I was dumbfounded then. Now I'm just sad.
detroitredwings,lxjif9r,2024-11-16 22:44:48,Noticed that too
detroitredwings,lxjjszh,2024-11-16 22:54:15,I have to wonder if Lalonde is a huge asshole toward the players and keeps it behind the scenes.
detroitredwings,lxjkybp,2024-11-16 23:02:25,I am trying to find this when was it?
detroitredwings,lxjq4ou,2024-11-16 23:41:41,We'd be better off if Larkin was a player-coach than having Lalonde any longer
detroitredwings,lxjri67,2024-11-16 23:52:10,Call a players only month.
detroitredwings,lxlrvqn,2024-11-17 10:35:56,I’d definitely take coach over Lalonde…I just hope he’s learned how to cope with no longer having his late wife Barb.
detroitredwings,lxjwgko,2024-11-17 00:32:30,Holy crap this is such a loser mentality
detroitredwings,lxke3kr,2024-11-17 03:21:37,Holy fuck our analytics are assssss
detroitredwings,lxml5d5,2024-11-17 13:18:16,Wow I never watch his interviews and I didn't realize this is literally how he thinks. Wow
detroitredwings,lxlshui,2024-11-17 10:39:27,I’ll just go ahead and d say it analytics do not belong in sports. Teams that rely on it are doomed.

detroitredwings,lxji53l,2024-11-16 22:42:54,If Lalonde isn't gone after this road trip I'm not buying tickets to anymore games this season.This is starting to feel like the Dollar Bill Wirtz era in Chicago where management doesn't care as long as they're making money.
detroitredwings,lxjl5fn,2024-11-16 23:03:52,You can keep Tanguay. He's got a top 10 PP in the league.
detroitredwings,lxjife3,2024-11-16 22:44:49,Yzerman drafted a Calder winning player and has his team having a better record every year since he’s been hired. He’s not above reproach he definitely needs to fire Lalonde but let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater either
detroitredwings,lxjtmrn,2024-11-17 00:08:53,We certainly need to hear something from Stevy Y pretty soon.
detroitredwings,lxji197,2024-11-16 22:42:11,I now believe Yzerman is part of the problem
detroitredwings,lxjjlkx,2024-11-16 22:52:48,100% in agreement. Let’s take it a step further. If he doesn’t fire Lalonde that’s him  admitting his last 5 years haven’t rebuilt this team either.
detroitredwings,lxjphdk,2024-11-16 23:36:36,I would agree with you Lalonde needs to go.But yzerman is also patient to a fault. Why bother firing him now? Our underlying metrics are a bottom 5 team. He can ride out the season let some shit contracts expire rookies play tons of minutes we get a fantastic pick and he comes back with 20M to upgrade more rookies next year and a brand new coach who runs a system that doesn’t make me want to gouge out my eyes.It absolutely sucks to consider another tank season as a fan. But I don’t see why we wouldn’t if the goal is a true contender. This system and d core stink. Let them stink. Then purge in the off-season. Let it be a catalyst for change.Everyone is always worried about that elite talent we lack. Maybe this disaster season is the chance to acquire some? Even good teams can have disaster seasons where they fall into the low teens… we can fall much lower to the benefit of the future and we don’t need to change a damn thing to do it.
detroitredwings,lxji1ue,2024-11-16 22:42:17,Once again Yzerman has concepts of a plan
detroitredwings,lxjrnqu,2024-11-16 23:53:19,Wings need to bring up farm league tenders like cossa to see how they perform because tenders can’t stop a beach ball right now. Defensive zone needs to be more aggressive and our power play has to capitalize because 5-on-5 needs some adjustments.
detroitredwings,lxjim1o,2024-11-16 22:46:04,That's me every night

detroitredwings,lxjmh5w,2024-11-16 23:13:40,On top of that pick any player any young player specifically I would say to illustrate my point more. Are any of them better than they were compared to when Lalonde took over?  -Edvinsson maybe a little bit but he’s only played 30 NHL games.  -Seider no.  -Raymond compared to rookie year I don’t think much better.  -Kasper a pinch maybe but how much of that is his time in GR?  -Rasmussen no.  -Veleno no.  -Berggren no.  If these guys aren’t getting any better we are REALLY FUCKED. A coach should be teaching them how to play better. And they should be improving. They aren’t learning shit because we are on the defensive 95% of the time. What people don’t understand is the Red Wings team that Bowman took over was EXCELLENT offensively already. Yzerman was a 100+ point player. They also didn’t have a salary cap. The writing is on the wall. EVEN IF he doesn’t have the talent this is not a winning strategy long term and players are not getting much better once they get here. He NEEDS TO FUCKING GO!
detroitredwings,lxjqz8g,2024-11-16 23:48:13,Unpopular take (maybe?) bit I'd keep DeBrincat as well. Second in goals and at least he's always hustling.

detroitredwings,lxk3osx,2024-11-17 01:34:30,The way I see it is we have some good players but they can’t play to their full potential with bad line pairings. As you mentioned poor line management. There are guys who drag down their entire line. I would not care seeing the following go: Copp Ras Compher Fischer Holl Gustafsson Petry.

He’s been great at being patient with the rookies developing which has hurt the Red Wings in the short term

detroitredwings,lxkf1bo,2024-11-17 03:32:01,Bu bu bu buttt the fluuuuuuuuuuu also we are only team that has to play back to backs also also ummmm trust the yzerplan!!!!!1!!1!111!
detroitredwings,lxkeldd,2024-11-17 03:27:06,Dont really want to say this but thats on the captain aswell. Seems like Perron was really important to that locker room
detroitredwings,lxjmig3,2024-11-16 23:13:56,I think he should be gone with or without a loss to SJ. 4 goals unanswered blown lead to a cellar dweller then almost shut out tonight and almost tripled up on shots
detroitredwings,lxjnzdk,2024-11-16 23:24:58,His comments after the Arizona game last year told me he wasnt the guy. I was already down on him from earlier in the year when Larkin was injured and Lalonde did not stick up for his player.
detroitredwings,lxju45c,2024-11-17 00:12:58,I was on the fence about him last year. This year clear backslide in roster and the established players and system are also worse. IMO the means he can’t maintain a minimum standard for the core therefore fuck him
detroitredwings,lxjuhgu,2024-11-17 00:15:59,Same. I was willing to give slack cus they almost made it and had some goalies woes. Now they stink and our goalies are the only bright spot. Keep whoever's running the pp and the goalie coach. This should also be yzermans last bullet. This time next year if the roster is still old and bad he shouldn't be here. At least the Lions are good and tigers are fun
detroitredwings,lxjhzl5,2024-11-16 22:41:53,And the Bernstein advantage
detroitredwings,lxjjpcn,2024-11-16 22:53:32,It's that beautiful time of year when car companies pressure people to gift Christmas cars with comically large ribbons.  What kind of American are you if you don't do this for your family?
detroitredwings,lxjihop,2024-11-16 22:45:15,And my axe?
detroitredwings,lxjkneb,2024-11-16 23:00:14,Toyotathon is real limp dick energy so you're right on there
detroitredwings,lxjnvx6,2024-11-16 23:24:14,I’m so pissed off at this team I haven’t bothered to watch a game in 2 weeks. Lions are amazing it’s football season and I’m focusing on that lol.
detroitredwings,lxjjhq8,2024-11-16 22:52:03,Fuck it hire Coach and let him talk about his dead wife BERB for all I care just get some new blood behind the bench holy fuck.
detroitredwings,lxjud00,2024-11-17 00:14:58,Fucking embarrassing!
detroitredwings,lxjo5gg,2024-11-16 23:26:15,It’s old as fuck lol. This could be a roster we had in like 2017 when we were really unraveling.
detroitredwings,lxkfkxo,2024-11-17 03:38:07,Outside of top line and top D pair we have so little to sell.
detroitredwings,lxjhwwl,2024-11-16 22:41:24,He already is the problem
detroitredwings,lxkfb3t,2024-11-17 03:35:03,They both probably should but im so fucking scared that they will just promote Draper to GM at somepoint
detroitredwings,lxjkfyg,2024-11-16 22:58:46,Been a terrible nickname since day 1
detroitredwings,lxjpl7w,2024-11-16 23:37:25,Hate the name
detroitredwings,lxjpd9e,2024-11-16 23:35:41,Ever heard of a GM by the name of Kenny Holland?
detroitredwings,lxjr310,2024-11-16 23:49:02,Best he can do is draft a guy with low skill but high compete
detroitredwings,lxjlefy,2024-11-16 23:05:41,If we tank this year and are good enough to miss out on McKenna next year I’m gonna pitch a fit
detroitredwings,lxjsp7u,2024-11-17 00:01:22,This roster isn't a contender but it's absolutely good enough to be in the playoff hunt with. Lalonde is getting next to nothing out of a roster that should be decent.A team with Kane Larkin DeBrincat Raymond Seider Edvinsson and Tarasenko should not be getting mugged by bottom-dwelling teams the way this team does.And they play well sometimes too which tells you it's not a talent issue it's a consistency and preparation issue and that's on coaching.
detroitredwings,lxjpqer,2024-11-16 23:38:33,It’s both dude 
detroitredwings,lxjl0l3,2024-11-16 23:02:53,> Walman for future considerationsWorse we had to pay to get rid of him.
detroitredwings,lxjj5ao,2024-11-16 22:49:39,Rolling 8 D-men wasn't sustainable and we needed the cap for Kasper.Maata being gone was the right move.Walman being traded away looks like a huge mistake considering Gus is useless offensively and defensively. Walman has better numbers that Gus.
detroitredwings,lxjjp1a,2024-11-16 22:53:28,Shaaaaakin’ like a dog shittin’ razorblades
detroitredwings,lxjn5tu,2024-11-16 23:18:43,Fuck you Derek stop ruining my team.
detroitredwings,lxjphw2,2024-11-16 23:36:43,He’s certainly not getting the most out of them but the players have so much more impact on the outcome than the coach man
detroitredwings,lxjsa22,2024-11-16 23:58:02,Why should we forecheck when they're going to bring the puck right back to us anyway? It's just more work. 
detroitredwings,lxjpl87,2024-11-16 23:37:25,Yep. And I think I’m in the minority and I love all former wings  but honestly I don’t any former players involved with management anymore . The organization needs people completely from the outside because there is just too much complacency it seems
detroitredwings,lxjjhof,2024-11-16 22:52:03,Once you see he’s hired all his friends in senior management roles you know it’s true
detroitredwings,lxjmrnq,2024-11-16 23:15:48,I got downvoted to hell when I said that the Pistons had surpassed the Red Wings in their rebuild but that is my genuine opinion.
detroitredwings,lxjpr6k,2024-11-16 23:38:44,Said that we had “some good looks/moments”.Which is ridiculous since we were outplayed for most of the game.
detroitredwings,lxk3yih,2024-11-17 01:36:55,Ghost and Perron are missed
detroitredwings,lxjryjl,2024-11-16 23:55:36,"""He will not pull off some Jack Adams worth changes but he will stay here."" - Narrator"
detroitredwings,lxjp15r,2024-11-16 23:33:03,It’s not the same roster man ghost mattered Perron mattered even Sprong mattered Tarasenko is not pulling his weight at all and the rest of the replacements also suck 
detroitredwings,lxjp8e6,2024-11-16 23:34:37,Yep. He knows he has infinite time. This is why I don’t want legacy / former wings players involved with management scouting  etc
detroitredwings,lxjp6gz,2024-11-16 23:34:12,He cares he knows he’s made mistakes 
detroitredwings,lxjkof8,2024-11-16 23:00:26,We’ll finish dead last and pick 5th and you’ll like it
detroitredwings,lxkghzi,2024-11-17 03:48:11,We pick Hagens and try to develop him to a defensive first fwd
detroitredwings,lxk6jec,2024-11-17 02:01:42,The problem is our management refuses to even believe there’s a problem. They’re living on another planet. Lalonde said after the game he thought it was “actually pretty close”. The press implies it’s because we’re just “tired from back to backs”. Even though it happened yesterday as well. I mean when leadership is that detached from reality what hope do we have anything will change?
detroitredwings,lxltbc1,2024-11-17 10:44:08,Aiming for the bottom ? Seriously? Stevie has spent to the cap this year. They’re not tanking lmao
detroitredwings,lxjoubc,2024-11-16 23:31:34,I’d take that honesty this current iteration of the Wings is a lottery squad with much better players especially forwards. They got so much dead weight outside of Mo and Ed on defense and I’m over Ras and Joe they’re both useless. Get ride of Lalonde dump Ras and Joe for Lombardi and Watson see if the Sharks would want Berggren and our 3rd for Liljegren and put Johansson next to him.Asking Wings fans to be patient while they get shit shoved in their face is a bit insulting even moreso when the Tigers and possibly the Pistons might have surpassed them in less time then Yzerman has in his six years here.
detroitredwings,lxjoy6q,2024-11-16 23:32:24,Will the team play better under a different coach and substantially improve?  I don’t know.  Won’t know unless we try.But if we stick with this guy there’s almost a guarantee that this season’s over before the halfway mark.  Not canning him because “it won’t make a difference” is a loser’s mentality.
detroitredwings,lxjieo2,2024-11-16 22:44:41,you’re not our real dad we can do what we want
detroitredwings,lxjimyz,2024-11-16 22:46:14,No it’s not are we watching the same team?
detroitredwings,lxjhzfd,2024-11-16 22:41:52,https://preview.redd.it/tz4mp9wtud1e1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=76bc53a20988ebfdc73ab1a0e3669a3ec044c4d8You sure about that? This isn’t a dig at them btw.
detroitredwings,lxjj50m,2024-11-16 22:49:36,Ottawa is dogshit. There’s no future where they make it with that roster.
detroitredwings,lxjjx2s,2024-11-16 22:55:03,No chance.

detroitredwings,lxn71s6,2024-11-17 15:14:39,Debrincat is doing so well what
detroitredwings,lxjwzta,2024-11-17 00:37:01,Seider struggling? I can only listen to the games on Audacy im out of state.
detroitredwings,lxjps29,2024-11-16 23:38:55,I've decided that it's malicious.
detroitredwings,lxjtlw2,2024-11-17 00:08:41,Going back to last year game 82 against Montreal might've been the 1st time he called timeout since February
detroitredwings,lxkly6e,2024-11-17 04:49:03,Maybe the yzerplan is looking for a first overall pick in the draft?
detroitredwings,lxjj1hv,2024-11-16 22:48:56,It’s malfeasance on his part.  Craig Berube called a timeout when his team *had the lead* and tore into them because they got complacent.  This bald clown doesn’t call a timeout when his team is under siege or when the captain is pleading for one.  What in the fuck man.It’s one of the few tools that a coach has at his disposal to manage the game and he actively refuses to use it.
detroitredwings,lxjjz74,2024-11-16 22:55:28,It’s literally the only tool a coach has to directly influence the game. Idk why coaches don’t use them every single game. even in like the first or second period if you’re getting bundled just call one why not?
detroitredwings,lxnpu30,2024-11-17 16:55:26,A five goal lead? JFC
detroitredwings,lxjwmdf,2024-11-17 00:33:52,I hear you but I don’t think so. To get away with being an asshole to your players for any significant stretch of time (as an NHL head coach) you have to be widely respected and/or a highly accomplished figure in the league. Or at the very least you have to possess a demanding presence and a strong demeanor.Lalonde I’m afraid lacks in all of the above departments.
detroitredwings,lxjlifr,2024-11-16 23:06:29,It was right after he scored he’s skating toward the bench and puts his hands together calling for a timeout.
detroitredwings,lxk0lm1,2024-11-17 01:06:53,I get the sense that he's trying his best to be just that. Poor guy.
detroitredwings,lxoveg5,2024-11-17 20:58:03,I know I’m way late here but I gotta disagree. As a professional in data analysis there is a clear place for the field in sports—hence why the massive influx of it in recent years. However to your point relying on stats to make EVERY decision and shoe-horning data where it doesn’t belong is a big problem. I would say this is a clear example of using cherry picked “stats” as an excuse. And sports particularly hockey is influenced significantly by resilience mentality and grit. So I guess I also sort of agree with you lol.
detroitredwings,lxk04tp,2024-11-17 01:02:43,That means the next one is Dan Campbell 2.0 right?
detroitredwings,lxjiip3,2024-11-16 22:45:26,Really do hope we see some empty arena seats as a result of this mess. Might helps speed up some changes.
detroitredwings,lxjj9lw,2024-11-16 22:50:29,I bought season tickets to the Tigers for next season so I’m not going to renew my wings season tickets after this season. I can’t afford both and the tigers games are way more fun and they went to the playoffs.  I don’t see a path the playoffs for the wings any time soon this team is so boring
detroitredwings,lxjl7zz,2024-11-16 23:04:22,We're Dead Wings 2.0 right now.
detroitredwings,lxjz1am,2024-11-17 00:53:22,Putting the trash patch on the sweater was definitely a signal that they value profits more than doing the right thing.
detroitredwings,lxjjusa,2024-11-16 22:54:36,Was very much planning on going to games during thanksgiving week when I’m home (live in Chicago now). Won’t be going unless Lalonde is fire or a real trade is made.
detroitredwings,lxjjgdm,2024-11-16 22:51:48,In addition people act like rebuilding a team to a Stanley Cup contender is a simple formula of do x number of steps and success is assured. There is no guarantee that a rebuild especially without receiving a #1 overall pick or even to3 will be successful. Lalonde has got to go and hopefully replaced with a coach that has seen success as an NHL head coach coach but overall the rebuild has been going relatively well with year to year progress. This year seems to be a real step back hence the need for a coaching change.
detroitredwings,lxkcd2j,2024-11-17 03:02:45,I really really dont want to see Yzerman spending 20m worth of AAV in free agency.
detroitredwings,lxk7u2z,2024-11-17 02:14:49,Talbot currently has a top 5 save percentage in the NHL playing behind a bad defense. Lyon was rough last night but it was his first game back in 2 weeks (injury.) Other than that he has a decent save percentage and 2 shutouts really only had 2 stinkers for games this season which seems pretty understandable due to how terrible our defense has been.
detroitredwings,lxkch86,2024-11-17 03:03:59,Lmfao our goalies and PP are only reason why we are even this high in standings
detroitredwings,lxjlet9,2024-11-16 23:05:45,Way of the road
detroitredwings,lxjzjic,2024-11-17 00:57:40,way of the road bud
detroitredwings,lxjixvv,2024-11-16 22:48:16,Blash wasn’t even that bad of a coach he just got stuck holding the reigns during the absolute disaster of Holland’s failed rebuild
detroitredwings,lxjklxc,2024-11-16 22:59:57,I disagree that that is a hot take. I don't think he was a bad coach. At all.
detroitredwings,lxjmxfh,2024-11-16 23:16:59,Complacency and collapses are a coach’s responsibility
detroitredwings,lxkix8m,2024-11-17 04:15:10,This is in no way meant to disparage Talbot and Lyon but the fact that with the roster we have and our goaltenders let alone Talbot are the best players on this team?! What the hell man.
detroitredwings,lxjkiao,2024-11-16 22:59:13,Yep.Ken Holland warned people about how easy it is to lose a winning culture and how difficult it can be to regain it.Few people want to admit it but we’re on track to being the next Buffalo Sabres unless drastic changes are made.
detroitredwings,lxkd28h,2024-11-17 03:10:19,Its kinda funny aswell considering how many veteran leadership ^TM players Yzerman brought in
detroitredwings,lxk00cs,2024-11-17 01:01:39,I complained about management and their role in creating a culture of losing within the team for years and got nothing but grief for it. Today I'm vindicated  although I wish I was wrong.
detroitredwings,lxjiu7w,2024-11-16 22:47:35,The question is will the Wings make the playoffs before or after the District Detroit is completed?
detroitredwings,lxjl8ij,2024-11-16 23:04:28,We don’t deserve it. Yzerman does though
detroitredwings,lxk1c8h,2024-11-17 01:13:42, The player development by the wings organization is I'm sad to say the complete shits. The wings need to overhaul player development and drafting too.
detroitredwings,lxjsxu8,2024-11-17 00:03:18,Depends on the return we’d get. He’s been underwhelming as a wing imo. I don’t see him ever hitting 40 goals again here.
detroitredwings,lxkyhie,2024-11-17 07:04:27,Right we have way too many dead weight guys on this team.
detroitredwings,lxkeq6o,2024-11-17 03:28:36,Its absurd how ppl still come up whit this as a legit argument
detroitredwings,lxjjar3,2024-11-16 22:50:42,He’s making less than we ever expected he’d want in free agency the only difference is he’s doing it on a roster that will likely make the playoffs while we can’t win a game to save our lives.
detroitredwings,lxk1ixn,2024-11-17 01:15:26,It took too long to sign Seider and Raymond and that negotiation duration probably played a part in ghost bear leaving and the team also failing to sign anyone to improve the team in the offseason.
detroitredwings,lxjqioc,2024-11-16 23:44:39,(They forgot that we traded a 2nd we got in another trade to dump Walman's contract)
detroitredwings,lxjjg0w,2024-11-16 22:51:44,Sounds like you’re also taking too many bong rips
detroitredwings,lxjn8b4,2024-11-16 23:19:14,Better cancel before game 82 is over bud I think you have to cancel sometime in January otherwise they’re gonna auto renew you and charge your card (assuming you’re enrolled in “ez pay” which most are)
detroitredwings,lxlot6y,2024-11-17 10:17:53,Yeah that’s fair. Also with so many other vets you would think they could step up. I’ve always felt we are missing some grinders to fire up the team during the game too
detroitredwings,lxjtoan,2024-11-17 00:09:14,This is when I knew as well
detroitredwings,lxjiglk,2024-11-16 22:45:03,You know in my despair I hadn't even considered that.
detroitredwings,lxjqstz,2024-11-16 23:46:50,Boys have ya ever been to the Grand Canyon…
detroitredwings,lxmnfoy,2024-11-17 13:30:25,Shit you’re right.
detroitredwings,lxji87y,2024-11-16 22:43:28,True I still don't get how we are up against the cap
detroitredwings,lxjw1md,2024-11-17 00:29:03,Yeah and I swear he coined it himself.
detroitredwings,lxjs6qy,2024-11-16 23:57:19,The gm that won 3 cups in Detroit? Lmao
detroitredwings,lxjzxt8,2024-11-17 01:01:03,Like Seider and Kasper?
detroitredwings,lxkfyda,2024-11-17 03:42:10,Kane looks so cooked other than PP.
detroitredwings,lxjsqio,2024-11-17 00:01:39,I know. I wonder if this is the league screwing with Yzerman cuz they have something on him.  Just bad deal after bad deal.
detroitredwings,lxjjeaf,2024-11-16 22:51:24,There were better options than trading a very consistently average to above average dman in Maataa.  I would have rather bought out Holl and Petry than this shit.
detroitredwings,lxjpqb3,2024-11-16 23:38:32,They're not all playing the same shit game because they're terrible dude.
detroitredwings,lxkg7l4,2024-11-17 03:45:00,This. I dont care what they did whit Wings when they played here. If they are shit at their job they need to go.
detroitredwings,lxjk38l,2024-11-16 22:56:16,I’m sure our pro scout Chris Yzerman has no relation to Steve
detroitredwings,lxjnvbh,2024-11-16 23:24:06,I also think the east is sooooo bad this year our wins were 76ers without anybody nets who suck lakers (good win) hawks heat without jimmy and the raptors. So it’s not like they’re good but maybe very medium which might be better than the wings rn
detroitredwings,lxjqs0n,2024-11-16 23:46:40,Jesus Christ
detroitredwings,lxkcw9e,2024-11-17 03:08:31,Watching the current state of our defense I even miss maatta
detroitredwings,lxjq49v,2024-11-16 23:41:35,Yeah we went from a contender for a playoff spot to feckless.  We need Ghost on the power play.  Sprong and Perron gave us some tough goals.  You get past the first line and we got nothing ir seems.  Tarastinko has been awful.  I hope they can shake this lethargic play.  We are terrible right now.
detroitredwings,lxknt1p,2024-11-17 05:09:56,I don’t get to see as many Wings games I would like but it sounds like Lalonde‘s the issue. He’s not holding the players accountable. I mean losing to the ducks? And in the way they lost. And the distance traveled between the two arenas is like 20 miles. It’s not like they had to fly to another state.  After the previous nights collapse I felt the Wings were going to try get a jump on the Kings but looking at the box score they fell flat. Like I said I hope they right the ship soon.
detroitredwings,lxm091z,2024-11-17 11:23:16,Its an expression - we're basically 2 points from the worst team in the league and there are no signs of it getting better. Not for a lack of trying mostly.
detroitredwings,lxjq0e8,2024-11-16 23:40:43,Uh everyone knows because this roster is bad. Our ceiling is a *borderline* playoff team. But yes fire the coach because the roster sucks that's his fault
detroitredwings,lxjjhg9,2024-11-16 22:52:00,I hope we can at least all agree that that’s hilarious
detroitredwings,lxjn9l3,2024-11-16 23:19:30,Well if that was the wild card for the whole conference we’d be in business. But I know it’s not.
detroitredwings,lxjl6a6,2024-11-16 23:04:02,They got a superstar in Stutzle
detroitredwings,lxjjszi,2024-11-16 22:54:15,Source: trust me bro
detroitredwings,lxjkerl,2024-11-16 22:58:32,He's a moron who a lot of us wonder why he hasn't been kicked out of here.
detroitredwings,lxkehk2,2024-11-17 03:25:56,He's doing alright had a few ??? moments in games with bad passes/giveaways but he's not really doing anything spectacular either. Only 2 points in the last 5 games and those came against the Ducks in a pretty embarrassing loss.
detroitredwings,lxk4peg,2024-11-17 01:43:49,Very easy to find an illegal stream my friend! Search around a bit
detroitredwings,lxk5ajd,2024-11-17 01:49:31,He’s doing well. He’s playing tough minutes and putting up some points. He’s made some mistakes but overall is playing well. In my opinion at least.
detroitredwings,lxjqac7,2024-11-16 23:42:53,Well put
detroitredwings,lxjy9hb,2024-11-17 00:47:06,If it's malicious it's only because Yzerman has given him this garbage roster to do god knows what with.
detroitredwings,lxjk0rp,2024-11-16 22:55:47,My new theory is that Gru is a massive prick to the players.
detroitredwings,lxkmaov,2024-11-17 04:52:56,The only way lalonde loses his job is if he loses his locker room……ignoring a captain like that seems to be a solid way to lose a locker room.
detroitredwings,lxmxmps,2024-11-17 14:23:22,Call one at the very start of the game. Ice the kicker.
detroitredwings,lxo12fd,2024-11-17 17:58:27,My bad. It was only a 4 goal lead.

detroitredwings,lxjlofh,2024-11-16 23:07:43,Oh yeah I see. Although I don't see the bench response but clearly they didn't go for it.https://x.com/RyanHanaWWP/status/1857991710636143020
detroitredwings,lxk13ki,2024-11-17 01:11:30,Patricia got fired right after Thanksgiving fingers crossed it happens for Lalonde!
detroitredwings,lxklji2,2024-11-17 04:44:29,Maybe after the lions win the Super Bowl we can ask him to coach some hockey
detroitredwings,lxjr6c5,2024-11-16 23:49:42,Make sure to tell your ticket rep why you're not renewing. I'm sure they'll call you regardless around renewal time but the org needs to hear this as much as possible. 
detroitredwings,lxjm0sn,2024-11-16 23:10:18,They hardly put an shots on net this year.  WTF?
detroitredwings,lxkapp4,2024-11-17 02:45:04,Tigers are going to be bad if they don't resign Skubal
detroitredwings,lxlrqww,2024-11-17 10:35:10,"I think Mike Illitch would've sooner sold *Little Caesars*(yes I am aware of what I am saying) than put a ""jersey sponsor"" (corporate for advertisement) on the Red Wings jersey. And then Chris put 'em on the Tigers jerseys too. Mr. I has to be rolling in his grave at a pace that if harnessed would solve the world energy crisis."
detroitredwings,lxjk9i9,2024-11-16 22:57:29,I've tickets to the game vs Boston on Saturday (brother is Bruins fan) the game vs Chicago in January (a co-worker and I go to that game every year) and the Stadium Series.I honestly wish I hadn't bought the Hawks or Stadium Series tickets now because I bought great seats to both.
detroitredwings,lxjolr4,2024-11-16 23:29:45,End of the day the biggest stumble we’ve had was we didn’t win a number one or two pick in any of the drafts during the years we really bottomed out.
detroitredwings,lxjjs6s,2024-11-16 22:54:06,Agreed. And this hasn’t exactly been a normal rebuild. Svechnikov Cholowski Rasmussen Zadina Veleno Berggren were Ken Holland’s first round picks from 2015-2018. The only second round or below that did anything in that time were Hronek and Lindstrom. Not exactly a strong foundation.
detroitredwings,lxkzk60,2024-11-17 07:14:37,I don’t want to see him use another top 15 pick on a “safe” player that plays a 200 ft game instead of a player with elite potential.
detroitredwings,lxkclww,2024-11-17 03:05:23,And 2nd(!!!!!!) in GSAX. Whit +8.2
detroitredwings,lxjju52,2024-11-16 22:54:28,Blashil was dog water man we would have 82 different starting lineups per year and they’d also rotate every intermission. He was a fine coach for the tank years of a rebuild I guess but he will almost 0% get another head coaching job
detroitredwings,lxjrcq3,2024-11-16 23:51:02,He wasn't a bad coach but he wasn't the coach to take this team on a deep playoff run. Unfortunately for us neither is Lalonde and he's worse at all the stuff that Blashill did well. 
detroitredwings,lxjly3t,2024-11-16 23:09:45,I’ve been revisiting GR’s stats from his tenure. Impressive stuff
detroitredwings,lxjn3gi,2024-11-16 23:18:14,Yes. Lalonde needs to go. It doesn’t matter if anyone else will or won’t be better.
detroitredwings,lxjjroj,2024-11-16 22:54:00,2 things that are never gonna happen
detroitredwings,lxjyu9v,2024-11-17 00:51:47,No he doesn't. Walman quite simply is not good enough to deserve a large contract. Yzerman did the right thing cutting him and making room to give a prospect a chance to prove themselves. The team needs to find superstar talent and we are not going to find it by filling the team with the likes of Walman.
detroitredwings,lxkdz4o,2024-11-17 03:20:15,Time to overhaul that old boys club.
detroitredwings,lxkczsz,2024-11-17 03:09:35,Honestly I don't see anyone hitting 40 goals except Larks
detroitredwings,lxlpjg1,2024-11-17 10:22:12,Yep. This is a results driven business. At some point you have to start winning. No more moral victories
detroitredwings,lxjjoe2,2024-11-16 22:53:20,Yeah that's my point he took a pay cut to leave nothing was keeping him in Detroit except maybe the biggest over payment in hockey history.
detroitredwings,lxjlef6,2024-11-16 23:05:40,Because I agree with you? At least I'm not the one hearing shit when words are typed
detroitredwings,lxlptwt,2024-11-17 10:23:56,Yeah true.
detroitredwings,lxm0u4c,2024-11-17 11:26:27,Dude for real does Fischer even play anymore. Like could he just go beat someone up and inspire any energy
detroitredwings,lxjjf01,2024-11-16 22:51:32,Luckily you reminded me of Toyotathon
detroitredwings,lxjtdzu,2024-11-17 00:06:53,Off a roster Jimmy D assembled lmao
detroitredwings,lxkmhkm,2024-11-17 04:55:06,He's a creative offensive forward playing in a system that emphasizes defensive responsibility and safe planned plays. He's a terrible fit for this style of hockey and I don't blame him for looking like he's bored out there. I just don't know why he came back at all unless he was told that the systems would be different this year.
detroitredwings,lxjjiyg,2024-11-16 22:52:17,Petry makes nothing since he's double retained.I could see the case for buying out Holl
detroitredwings,lxmj8jt,2024-11-17 13:08:03,Thanks man
detroitredwings,lxjrel6,2024-11-16 23:51:26,It’s not great for young guys to develop in a bottom dweller poor me losing culture lead by Lalonde.
detroitredwings,lxjo1gf,2024-11-16 23:25:24,Seems like your protoypical regular season forward. Brady on the other hand was forged in the depths of mount doom for the playoffs.
detroitredwings,lxkeoe1,2024-11-17 03:28:02,What were his pt splits at the end of last season if you don't mind me asking?
detroitredwings,lxphkuc,2024-11-17 23:22:51,Espn plus is like $15 dollars a month and has almost every single nhl game out of your market
detroitredwings,lxmyo9x,2024-11-17 14:28:59,Refs hand would be shaking at the next puck drop!
detroitredwings,lxl02bc,2024-11-17 07:19:21,The way Larkin's head drops right after he gives the signal tells me that he was met with a resounding shake of the bald dome.
detroitredwings,lxlsigf,2024-11-17 10:39:33,Thank you for sharing. Larkin does not looked gassed. He would have stayed on his knees. Slowly risen like a former captain on his last legs did often. Larkin looks like he’s clapping. There’s no shot of Lalonde shaking his head no.Damn pitchforks are marching over a bunch on conjecture.
detroitredwings,lxlbld4,2024-11-17 08:51:29,He can’t go anywhere for two years no matter what
detroitredwings,lxjkv7m,2024-11-16 23:01:47,Berggren was second round as well.
detroitredwings,lxkc9ih,2024-11-17 03:01:41,Yeah and Yzerman whit Tamba had Brett Connolly Koekooekok or how tf you spell that etc. Lets not act that he hasnt had some blunders lol
detroitredwings,lxldxdg,2024-11-17 09:08:01,Yeah this is true aswell.
detroitredwings,lxjk7aq,2024-11-16 22:57:03,I just don’t agree. He won an AHL championship a USHL championship and won NCAA coach of the year after leading WMU to one of their best seasons ever. He has been successful at every level of hockey he coached except the NHL and I don’t think that was due to him but more so the rebuilding Wings
detroitredwings,lxjp1y3,2024-11-16 23:33:14,Blash would’ve had last years roster in the playoffs
detroitredwings,lxjk91g,2024-11-16 22:57:23,That's the spicy 3rd option. Though I find it hard to believe that the Wings will never make the playoffs. It might take another decade but eventually the law of averages says we'll make the playoffs.
detroitredwings,lxjz1ws,2024-11-17 00:53:31,Cutting him? Sure. Trading him away for nothing and shipping out a 2nd along with it? What is he doing
detroitredwings,lxkfwx6,2024-11-17 03:41:45,But Chiarot Holl and Copp are definitely deserving of the ones he gifted them....Yzerman has filled the team with the likes of Petry Holl Copp Chiarot Gustafsson Tarasenko etc.  He has done the wrong thing repeatedly since 2022 when it comes to signing players(or trading for them in Petry's case).
detroitredwings,lxkbkvu,2024-11-17 02:54:20,The why this fraud of a GM singend him for one?
detroitredwings,lxlxj6s,2024-11-17 11:08:11,Raymond has the talent not sure he’ll ever be able to under lalonde though
detroitredwings,lxjkmmh,2024-11-16 23:00:05,yeah why would we ever consider giving him a deal like Holl’s
detroitredwings,lxjl203,2024-11-16 23:03:09,I mean if we knew he’d take $3.2M/year for 3 years to stay I would have done that deal in a heartbeat. He was a key component to backend offense while not being a total liability all the time. The roster is worse without him and we all expected he’d want at least $4M maybe $4.5M. It doesn’t fix everything if we kept him but it’s not likely that it’s this bad if he stayed.
detroitredwings,lxjlso6,2024-11-16 23:08:35,I’m just messing with you after you suggested weed enhances intelligence.
detroitredwings,lxn2rgk,2024-11-17 14:51:15,Agreed I wound have Watson up on the 4th line as well. 4 skill lines isn’t working. Need some grit
detroitredwings,lxjtn48,2024-11-17 00:08:58,How many more years does Stevie need for this team to make the playoffs as a 7 or 8 seed?
detroitredwings,lxkvt0n,2024-11-17 06:37:22,While i agree there is more to it than that aswell. His edge work and puchandeling seems to have diegressed.
detroitredwings,lxjjnwy,2024-11-16 22:53:15,Frankly who cares if Petry is free!  He’s a negative asset to this club right now.
detroitredwings,lxjyspk,2024-11-17 00:51:25,This is simple. Do you think we have a playoff roster?
detroitredwings,lxkg8zi,2024-11-17 03:45:27,Veleno was the 2nd first round pick they had in his draft as well he's entirely replacable but at 30th overall he turned out ok.
detroitredwings,lxjphki,2024-11-16 23:36:38,I think he is a great coach who was put into a spot that was impossible.  I hope he gets another go somewhere.
detroitredwings,lxjpudb,2024-11-16 23:39:25,"Those are different leagues. I dont care what he's done in the minors and college. We have only had success with coaches that had former experience Bowman and Babcock both won before coming to Detroit in the NHL. They need to stop with these ""first time head coach experiements"". Just because they're good in another league doesn't mean that will transfer to the NHL"
detroitredwings,lxjkygj,2024-11-16 23:02:27,We shall see! I don’t dislike him as a person or anything just don’t think he’s head coach caliber. But that’s not a diss just that he’s not one of the top 32 coaches in the world. Maybe if you toss him behind a better roster he would cook.
detroitredwings,lxjziax,2024-11-17 00:57:23,Clearing cap space for a player who isn't worth his contract or possibly is a locker room problem. Remember the three long losing streaks last season. Walman scored 2 overtime winners in his career in Detroit and achieved nothing more. He doesn't deserve the adoration or a fixed spot on the team. I'm happier testing prospects using his spot.
detroitredwings,lxjni54,2024-11-16 23:21:17,Yeah I think the reality is he wouldn't sign that contract in Detroit
detroitredwings,lxjwwkk,2024-11-17 00:36:15,I honestly don’t think ever. He doesn’t have a good gauge of talent
detroitredwings,lxk3hfv,2024-11-17 01:32:42,Probably not. I don’t think they are bad enough to be 26th in the nhl. Wild card could be *possible.* Do I think they can win a playoff series? Probably not. So I at least want a good vibe locker room positive culture and competitive play
detroitredwings,lxjw8i8,2024-11-17 00:30:39,He had an AHL roster most of the time he was here. Mantha and Bert were top line guys and AA is in the AHL rn
detroitredwings,lxjzu7n,2024-11-17 01:00:12,Still doesn’t change the fact that we traded him away for nothing and added a 2nd along with. Why not just release him?
detroitredwings,lxkh390,2024-11-17 03:54:44,"I get that ppl are afraid of loosing culture but what good does having "" good vibe locker room"" If we dont have needle mover prospects in it"
detroitredwings,lxk0fzz,2024-11-17 01:05:25,If that was a legitimate option Stevie would have taken it. He probably couldn't.
detroitredwings,lxjg28x,2024-11-16 22:28:39,wtf am I looking at?  At least label your axes.
detroitredwings,lxjd0nk,2024-11-16 22:08:15,Yeah I noticed this at a couple games I attended. The shot totals for both the wings and our opponent would occasionally go down. I think if a shot is reviewed and it is determined that a goalie stopped it but it wouldn't have gone in if they didn't touch it then it isn't a shot on net.
detroitredwings,lxlnb6c,2024-11-17 10:08:53,We had shots???
detroitredwings,lxkqw7y,2024-11-17 05:44:17,It’s because they’re always falling behind in the first 2 periods so then we attack in the 3rd while opponents defend resulting in more shots. Lalonde’s tactics are so bad. No way we should be this bad with Larkin Raymond Kane and DeBrincat
detroitredwings,lxn63rf,2024-11-17 15:09:31,I think it is because gambling is so important now. There are quite a few offerings for shot total player shots shots in a period etc. The league is being super serious about shots now because of that
detroitredwings,lxjs4lj,2024-11-16 23:56:52,These sorts of things have always been reviewed for accuracy. A shot could have been going wide but it was only able to be seen in replays.
detroitredwings,lxmmx4h,2024-11-17 13:27:43,I don't think OP made this chart but is just using it as an example. My assumption is x-axis is meant to represent duration of the game and y-axis is shot count. OPs point is that we sometimes have our shot count reduced during the game and he is asking why that happens.I think it is because shots get reviewed after the fact and deemed to not be shots
detroitredwings,lxjdr9w,2024-11-16 22:13:14,Yeah. I’ve noticed over the years there’s usually an initial delay when posting a shot when it’s in question to start with but then it almost seems like there’s a second review.
detroitredwings,lxojn1e,2024-11-17 19:46:21,This is not what this post is about this is about a ticker saying we have 15 shots and then it dropping a minute later to 13 because the shots were under review to see if they were a shot on net the reason it matters is because of gambling of course
detroitredwings,lxn83zy,2024-11-17 15:20:23,I had a similar thought. Additionally I was thinking expected goals ratios and shooting percentage may have been a driver for the additional scrutiny and for scouting purposes.
detroitredwings,lxn5xx0,2024-11-17 15:08:36,To add let's define a shot on goal. It's one that would go in an empty-net goal. Going wide doesn't count. Hitting the post doesn't count. A shot blocked by a defender doesn't count. So in the review process it would have revealed something unnoticed when the shot was recorded.
detroitredwings,lxn7fkz,2024-11-17 15:16:41,Right it’s just an example of how the shots aren’t a linear progression. I would never start a shot total at 4.25…. For a few reasons.
detroitredwings,lxjgvan,2024-11-16 22:34:14,I think what's happening now is the shot total is incremented quickly then the review happens and it is adjusted down if they determine it wasn't on net.
detroitredwings,lxje01f,2024-11-16 22:14:51,My rule is if the puck is in play or a face off is about to happen I’m not checking my phone
detroitredwings,lxjr8au,2024-11-16 23:50:06,Nothing is going the way it should w this team rn
detroitredwings,lxk4o8u,2024-11-17 01:43:31,At work I try to watch the wings on the Bally/fanduel app but during the live broadcast it skips? Freezes and then goes back a couple of seconds and restarts does it almost constantly. I’ve tried 2 different iPads and they both act the same. Strange thing is watching a rebroadcast the games stream fine. At home on tv they stream ok. I’m over it cancelled my subscription and waiting for amazon to figure it out before I try it again
detroitredwings,lxny3to,2024-11-17 17:41:29,It was that bad last year with bally too. I somehow get a minute behind watching Tigers/Pistons/Red Wings midway through the game.

detroitredwings,lxicpg7,2024-11-16 18:17:43,Op might have better luck describing the interview. Id be down but I'd like to know what it's regarding to ensure Im what you're looking for!Edit I see it's just general Hockey why take someone to the game super generous for that
detroitredwings,lxi9qo8,2024-11-16 17:59:11,Nice! If I was in the area I’d totally hit you up on that. Good luck to you.
detroitredwings,lxiag4w,2024-11-16 18:03:36,If I was in the area id do it in a heartbeat
detroitredwings,lxid5d2,2024-11-16 18:20:29,I have season tickets and wouldn't need a ticket but what specifically do you need to talk to us about and for how long? I usually get to the game right when the gates open and then wonder why I showed up so early so I'm sure I would have some spare time.
detroitredwings,lxigxcx,2024-11-16 18:44:11,If still needing someone I’d be willing to
detroitredwings,lxia2x3,2024-11-16 18:01:17,I’d be down for a free ticket! Is it just to interview someone at a game or someone active on Wings’ social media or something?
detroitredwings,lxin60u,2024-11-16 19:22:37,Thats awesome! I'm giving the free ticket to the first person who inquired but I will send you the questions I have and you are more then welcome to join the group at the game. The more perspectives I get the better.
detroitredwings,lxiem8s,2024-11-16 18:29:41,cuz thats part of it and  is a fun way to do it. I will ask general questions about hockey culture red wings history etc
detroitredwings,lxiamx4,2024-11-16 18:04:48,which game works for you my friend
detroitredwings,lxif0wr,2024-11-16 18:32:16,"oh season tickets u say? I said free ticket to get get ppls attention. .I will ask general questions about hockey culture red wings history etc. I'm a big sports fan just havent gotten into hockey. Despite being from the ""state of hockey""."
detroitredwings,lxiiy4q,2024-11-16 18:56:43,I can only pay for one other ticket but if u wanna come as part of the group that'd dope. we gonna be in the cheap seats anyway lol

detroitredwings,lxio0aw,2024-11-16 19:27:46,Sounds fun please let me know
detroitredwings,lxiapsg,2024-11-16 18:05:18,I’m in Mississippi! I’m not in the area!
detroitredwings,lxig2w2,2024-11-16 18:38:56,Yeah I've got season tickets to the Lions and wings. I would be more than happy to chat with you at the arena. I don't have an extra ticket so we wouldn't be able to sit together but I don't need anything from you in terms of tickets.
detroitredwings,lxip15f,2024-11-16 19:34:03,AT the moment I'm thinking of Thursday against the Islanders.
detroitredwings,lxib645,2024-11-16 18:08:07,shit thought it said arena lol
detroitredwings,lxigmsr,2024-11-16 18:42:22,Alr i'll keep that in mind my friend. Not sure which game I'll be going to yet as I don't have my work schedule for next week till monday. Most likely will be going to the islanders game on thursday
detroitredwings,lxib8bf,2024-11-16 18:08:30,It’s all good! Hope you find someone
detroitredwings,lxih28g,2024-11-16 18:45:02,Only tricky thing is I'm in Europe at the moment so I'm gonna miss the Islanders game. I'll be back for the Bruins.
detroitredwings,lxii37k,2024-11-16 18:51:25,ah okay. I won't know which game I'll be going to until monday. If not I'll send you the questions if you're interested anyway.
detroitredwings,lxiic8i,2024-11-16 18:52:56,Yeah that's fine. Shoot me a DM if I can help
penguins,lxu59oh,2024-11-18 18:09:13,Are you in the Pittsburgh area? You can try your luck before/after practice at UPMC in Cranberry. I know it wouldn't be from Santa but if you brought her along your chances would go up like crazy. He's been very generous the couple of times I've come in from out of town to get stuff signed. I framed a jersey he signed for me and he gave me a killer autograph on a piece of wood art I made. Honestly we don't deserve him! PM me if you want specific details happy to help.
penguins,lxu7t6g,2024-11-18 18:23:54,If you are in Pittsburgh Baseball Card Castle in Cranberry has tons and tons of signed penguins and Crosby stuff.
penguins,lxuajkp,2024-11-18 18:39:46,I have one somewhere let me see if I can dig it out.
penguins,lxtzcgw,2024-11-18 17:36:29,Canucks fans have been wanting Pettersson for a while now just to complete their trio set of Petterssons.
penguins,lxtyw04,2024-11-18 17:34:01,Hell yeah let's start the bidding war
penguins,lxtzgiq,2024-11-18 17:37:05,Please send him to the Vancouver Pettersons.
penguins,lxtzlfk,2024-11-18 17:37:48,How man Petterssons does Vancouver need? They just recalled their other one!
penguins,lxtylmf,2024-11-18 17:32:27,Jimmy likes to make TDL moves way before the TDL
penguins,lxtz2bi,2024-11-18 17:34:57,I haven’t loved how Petey has looked this year. Obviously we don’t want to undersell him but it certainly wouldn’t be a bad idea to move him sooner in case his value keeps trending down.
penguins,lxu3elc,2024-11-18 17:58:37,1 McDavid please
penguins,lxu7y9s,2024-11-18 18:24:43,Canucks you can’t just own all the Petterssons
penguins,lxu6nqs,2024-11-18 18:17:14,I really like Pettersson. He is a stupid good defensive defenseman.
penguins,lxu8env,2024-11-18 18:27:22,A first and second round pick at least. Think about it  he’s a top 4 defenseman in his prime I known he’s a pending UFA but a first from the Oilers is like a second rounder because they will make playoffs and go deep (probably). A first and legit prospect would be good too
penguins,lxu8g8k,2024-11-18 18:27:37,Sell him while there is still interest. He has regressed this year.
penguins,lxuaofh,2024-11-18 18:40:33,if i were an opposing GM i’d be way more concerned about locking down Beauvillier before he’s worth multiple firsts
penguins,lxu454k,2024-11-18 18:02:45,Petterson for Nurse and a 1st let’s go
penguins,lxu7281,2024-11-18 18:19:35,He can room with Elias Pettersson…or Elias Pettersson!
penguins,lxub5k2,2024-11-18 18:43:19,We’re in a rebuild though. If we can get picks or good prospects for him then do it
penguins,lxu8ig6,2024-11-18 18:27:59,Nurse sucks literally one of the reasons they couldn’t beat panthers
penguins,lxti72u,2024-11-18 16:08:00,Hope you track down what you’re after… might consider that O’Connor seems likely to be on the trading block this year
penguins,lxtk0aw,2024-11-18 16:17:03,I got one customized buying through Hockey Authentic but I’ve heard the Canada Post strike may be causing them to limit/not currently take orders; not sure if that’s just for send-in customizations or if it applies to any order through them. May not be as cost-effective if other retailers had pre-stitched options for DOC but it’s *an* option at least.Looks like they actually still have some Adidas in stock too if that matters to you
penguins,lxtm25v,2024-11-18 16:27:23,Not sure if you’re local but you could get a blank and take it to ProKnitwear for customization. They do the Pens on ice jerseys
penguins,lxu483z,2024-11-18 18:03:14,I manifested my DOC jersey in my charity bag last season.
penguins,lxtczta,2024-11-18 15:41:55,The way Ovi’s scoring right now is unbelievable. With last night’s HT he’s actually on pace to break the record in Pittsburgh in February not on the final night of the season. Really incredible and we as rival fans should appreciate it.
penguins,lxtf4ct,2024-11-18 15:52:32,It would be poetic if he broke it against us.
penguins,lxthn9c,2024-11-18 16:05:14,He’s gonna get it late March/Early April this year.  Dude is on a mission this year.
penguins,lxtjvks,2024-11-18 16:16:24,It's been almost 20 years I don't feel anything but overwhelming joy for Ovechkin and extreme gratitude for getting the opportunity to watch him compete side-by-side with Sid. I don't necessarily want him to score the record-breaking goal against Pittsburgh but I do want him to do it on home ice and surrounded by as many former Caps teammates as they can drum up.
penguins,lxtg3d2,2024-11-18 15:57:24,Wouldn't they want him to score it against the kings?
penguins,lxteel1,2024-11-18 15:49:00,Looks like he might have it by Christmas the way he’s going
penguins,lxtgzgl,2024-11-18 16:01:53,r/lostredditors
penguins,lxtsztw,2024-11-18 17:02:37,Me being Russian from Moscow as him I don’t like him. I actually met him once and he was very disrespectful and smelling like shit.
penguins,lxti55r,2024-11-18 16:07:44,I saw that that’s what got me thinking. When the schedule came out. I was looking for the last game as a chance for the record. The talk last year of him not being the same Ovi got me thing.  The talk last year of his decline. Made me wonder. Alas go Ovi go!!!!!
penguins,lxtm31q,2024-11-18 16:27:31,Dueling hat tricks 
penguins,lxtisxd,2024-11-18 16:11:03,I like that!!! King Penguins 
penguins,lxtikq6,2024-11-18 16:09:54,Id say this conversation has ties to the penguins. Why so bitter wooble?
penguins,lxtj0l1,2024-11-18 16:12:07,I meant more that he would break it against the team Gretzky was playing for when he broke it previously.
penguins,lxtm97n,2024-11-18 16:28:23,Either way that’s an awesome take
penguins,lxtmg89,2024-11-18 16:29:21,Is your user name a tribute to Radek Bonk #14?
penguins,lxtn1kr,2024-11-18 16:32:22,It’s posdible
penguins,lxsm0l6,2024-11-18 13:25:45,This sucks. We went to the game last year and had a great time. My daughter made dozens of bracelets and gave them away and traded them with other kids; the atmosphere was so fun. I thought the crowd size was decent and the energy was definitely high so this is disappointing.
penguins,lxsltkc,2024-11-18 13:24:48,Hopefully this doesn’t rule us out to get a team
penguins,lxsq3sq,2024-11-18 13:46:18,I have a feeling they're gonna use this to gauge who teams 7 and 8 will be.I would almost certainly bet it's St. Louis and Quebec City. St. Louis for being their first 'southern' market and Quebec to capitalize on the NHL refusing to go there.And for the fact that they'll have the best team in PQ at that point based on how the toilet seats have been playing. They look like *us* rn
penguins,lxsq6vz,2024-11-18 13:46:44,"I ended up watching a LOT of PWHL games last year on YT. 1) Lot more physical than I expected. No they weren't dropping the gloves and throwing hands but they were laying out and knocking each other around.2) Wasn't just dump-n-chase. Lots of passes (reminded me of the Penguins PP last year) and some great rushes. 3) The jerseys. Thank the LORD they have buried last year's abominations next to the Ark of the Covenant. I get the league was a bit rushed but in the immortal words of Will Smith from MIB1: 'Dayam"".4) I definitely think Pittsburgh could support a team."
penguins,lxsmi9p,2024-11-18 13:28:12,I don't feel like they marketed the game last year all that well doing it on St. Patty's weekend didn't help. I bought tickets but ended up being out of town that weekend so I'm bummed I won't get to go this year. There are other dates on the schedule with venue TBA so I guess hope is not lost.
penguins,lxtlbdc,2024-11-18 16:23:38,Women’s hockey is exhilarating. I went to one of the USA vs Canada games last year and was blown away. Fantastic product. Fantastic atmosphere. Hope the sport continues to grow and we see more NCAA scholarships for women’s hockey players in the future. The PWHL playoffs were fun to watch and getting it all for free on YouTube was the cherry on top.
penguins,lxtn2zz,2024-11-18 16:32:35,Damn my fiancée and I were hoping so bad Toronto would come back this year.
penguins,lxsqdie,2024-11-18 13:47:40,i was just thinking this! 
penguins,lxt77wk,2024-11-18 15:12:26,oh no as I thought
penguins,lxu2n0q,2024-11-18 17:54:22,Was it the one at the Lemieux ice rink?
penguins,lxty05p,2024-11-18 17:29:15,"I want to believe that we're not getting a game this time because there are some dealings going on behind the scenes and we're already a lock to get a franchise so they don't need to ""test"" the market anymore. But I'm probably just huffing copium"
penguins,lxsz4tv,2024-11-18 14:31:23,When do we celebrate Saint Partricia?
penguins,lxu72bu,2024-11-18 18:19:36,It was at the igloo
penguins,lxsn7df,2024-11-18 13:31:42,I go to Gettyimages.com and search for the teams and date of the game I went to.The pics are watermarked but that's the first place to find pics from games.
penguins,lxtezcz,2024-11-18 15:51:51,I always look on Getty Images when the Pens play the Ducks here in California. I always get a seat right behind the net for that game and find myself in the photos the next day (if we've scored enough goals!)
penguins,lxspapv,2024-11-18 13:42:14,Apparently Tanger wanted to tag along. (3rd from left in RMU jersey)
penguins,lxrnotm,2024-11-18 10:29:43,Really would love to see the STEEL CITY CLASSIC tournament make a come back RMU DUQUESNE PITT and WVU all have great programs! Bring it back!!
penguins,lxsjoqa,2024-11-18 13:14:05,Literally RMU is the only one of those schools that plays D1 - the rest have club teams only.
penguins,lxsowt9,2024-11-18 13:40:17,This article is about the club team though. Also club hockey is still fun. lol
penguins,lxt1btk,2024-11-18 14:42:30,I mean it only says it right in the FIRST sentence…> Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin and Robert Morris ACHA **DI** Hockey will come together for its annual charity game
penguins,lxp7iq3,2024-11-17 22:13:55,Make sure the opponent is bad so the pens have a chance of winning.
penguins,lxp7l2z,2024-11-17 22:14:20,It's always fun to see a game against the Flyers we play them at home December 23rd it looks like!
penguins,lxpirzy,2024-11-17 23:31:33,Im always a fan of sitting in the corners. A lot of people do like (and theyre usually more expensive) like what would be the 50 yard line or middle ice but Ive always liked sitting in the corners like this would be around sections 105/109/116/120 or 215 209 224 232 somewhere around there. Would prefer the side where the Pens attack twice. Tickets are usually reasonable in the corners and I think its a great view. I never liked behind the goals
penguins,lxpo68i,2024-11-18 00:12:08,Top row of the lower bowl or first row of the upper bowl as close to the center as possible.  If you wait a few more weeks  they're gonna start giving them away
penguins,lxquoz2,2024-11-18 07:21:09,Saturday Feb 22 vs Washington at this rate we may see Ovechkin break the goals records that day.
penguins,lxqyqco,2024-11-18 07:52:49,https://www.nhl.com/penguins/tickets/promotional-scheduleConsider a bobblehead night to go to just make sure you’re part if the first 7500 in line to get one.Go with upper level they’re all pretty good. If you get there early for bobblehead or other promotional the upper level has lots of food options so you can sit and eat. It’ll be a lot more easygoing to spend your money on food drink parking rather than a lower level seat.Lower 200’s (201-211) are on the “Pens Attack Twice” side. In my opinion you don’t want to be behind the net like this to watch the Pens score. It’s just an angle you never see so it feels weird especially on breakaways. Corners/Sides are good on that side or anything on the other side of the rink which are usually cheaper anyway (Sec220-234). You might not be closest to the offense for 2 periods but it doesn’t matter you’ll still get a great view of plays developing breakaways etc. These days it’s way more interesting to see the lines coming off the bench and how Sully is using them. Back in the day you’d want that lower bowl sec104 a few rows up to see Geno “Score” Malkin but these games you are going to enjoy the upper bowl more with your date a burger and a tall boy and a couple bucks to spare.Lastly- Pay attention to Facebook and Penguins website the next couple games. When Geno scored his 500th they put seats on sale for $71 LL $35 upper level for 2 upcoming games. They might do the same for Sid who’s about to score his 600th. They do it so that when they go to do pregame ceremony for his 600 on a future game they know they have some seats filled.
penguins,lxsvguh,2024-11-18 14:13:02,Go during one of the bobblehead games you at least walk out with something to take with you.
penguins,lxp9gyq,2024-11-17 22:26:42,I always employ that strategy even when we're okayish
penguins,lxp8t50,2024-11-17 22:22:19,what’s your seat recommendation?
penguins,lxpb5jm,2024-11-17 22:37:58,Second this I’m taking my girlfriend to this game for her first game at PPG.
penguins,lxrvry5,2024-11-18 11:12:57,We have a big family group going to this one. We’re really looking forward to it.
penguins,lxqzdx8,2024-11-18 07:57:37,This is the way. Great view of all areas of the ice close enough to the action to really feel the experience but high enough up that you even get a good view of the play along the near boards
penguins,lxqz1zj,2024-11-18 07:55:13,That would be so fun if it happened another great wrinkle to add in the Pens-Caps/Sid-Ovy rivalry
penguins,lxss319,2024-11-18 13:56:06,">even when we're okayishWorked the last couple of years these days I'd employ the strategy of ""go if the tickets happen to be free or extremely cheap and you have *literally* nothing better to do"".Also go late in the season because that's when all of the zaniness and fluke bullshit Penguins magic happens."
penguins,lxp9dso,2024-11-17 22:26:07,I like the upper bowl. Total view of the action
penguins,lxp99qa,2024-11-17 22:25:23,Oooh depends on how much you're willing to spend. I'm able to take advantage of StudentRush so I end up sitting wherever for super cheap. I was at the game last night in section 206 and liked it. Really not a bad spot in the house just good to be on the end where the Pens shoot into twice
penguins,lxp9srm,2024-11-17 22:28:51,any specific section?
penguins,lxp9yxw,2024-11-17 22:29:59,I usually end up behind the goal that the pens defend twice. I'd prefer the other end but it's cheaper. Sorry don't know the section names by heart.
penguins,lxpadg3,2024-11-17 22:32:42,okay stupid question; When you say upper bowl do you mean the higher seats in the bowl or the upper level? I’m used to Acrisure definitions of the “bowl” so I’m not really sure how PPG defines them.
penguins,lxpam8d,2024-11-17 22:34:21,So at ppg there is a lower ring a floating upper ring that you have to take escalators to get to. I mean the uper level/ring
penguins,lxo1vh1,2024-11-17 18:03:02,That was my favorite time as a sports fan and it's not close

penguins,lxolfu9,2024-11-17 19:57:07,Man I remember when we won the Cup in 09 I went to that website five minutes after the game ended because I felt a connection to that site and those guys. I felt like I was celebrating with them even though I didn’t know them and they didn’t know me. Incredible memories.
penguins,lxos99k,2024-11-17 20:38:44,Pics of dejected opposing fans with “STUNNED” placed on top of them in bold red font will always be peak art.
penguins,lxoxm64,2024-11-17 21:11:49,tPB was love. tPB was life. Their peak accomplishment was that game in Columbus when at least half the crowd was Pens fans with Charlie's cutouts and then there was this postgame where Steigy and Errey were showing them to the camera completely oblivious as to what they actually were. I also remember a shot of Pens locker room full of photoshops from tPB (possibly 09 cup run?). Paul Martin power ball. Free Candy. Disco Dan and Bing. Fiesta Mexicana. tPB will always have a special place in my heart.
penguins,lxomfa9,2024-11-17 20:03:04,Adam Derek jmarsh all GOATs. I hated sports didn’t even care. Their writing was perfect. I don’t know if I’ll ever love hockey as much as I did back then.

penguins,lxp6rp0,2024-11-17 22:09:04,Those were the days. They chronicled the growth of that team from the xgeneration to the cup. Such a cool time. Great writing. I was on the blog daily.
penguins,lxpdcc7,2024-11-17 22:52:54,Man it was the best. Every morning the day after a game tPb was the first thing I looked at.

penguins,lxopqdq,2024-11-17 20:23:15,My favorite thing to ever come from pensblog was after some ridiculous goal was scored their tweet about it was “Man that goal was so good even Terri had to light up a cigarette after”
penguins,lxp0y5o,2024-11-17 21:32:30,Didn’t they use an old lady peeking around a door when it was an elimination game in the playoffs? I vividly remember the image but can’t remember when they would use it.Also the David Copperfield photoshop for the “magic number” to clinch a playoff spot was elite.
penguins,lxp2kju,2024-11-17 21:42:32,I was more of a PSAMP guy but tPb was also great.  Met one of the guys one time and he was super low key almost awkward.  The first thing he said to me was to ask me if i had a social media presence.  Didn't say much the entire rest of the night and I just assumed he was the stereotypical keyboard warrior or whatever.

penguins,lxrd6q8,2024-11-18 09:29:05,Something about that whole Era of Penguins hockey was special. I was ending high school and getting into college. The Pens getting a lot of great players and looking like they could do something special then the fan base starting to truly believe as they DID start doing something special. I think a lot of it also had to do with being the same age as all the young players coming to the team that I felt like I related to them more? (It also makes me feel old now lol).I've submitted a handful of Stunned fan shots and photos of the anthem.

penguins,lxoa2um,2024-11-17 18:51:10,If you’re also a Steelers fan those were a few years that will never be matched
penguins,lxp2vdr,2024-11-17 21:44:23,It was the best time for so many reasons. Obviously the whole saga of drafting Fleury Sid Geno and Staal going from being absolute garbage under Edzo then being soff then Disco Dan turning things around...losing to Detroit and then winning the rematch the next year...that was SUCH an exciting chapter in Pens history. Easily tops anything since then for me including '16 and '17. No question.But it wasn't just that; I had just started college around the time we drafted Sid and those were the days when you could go student rush a game (at the Igloo!) for like 20 bucks. For lower bowl seats! And that was back when the ushers didn't give as much of a shit either so if something opened up right on the glass you could pretty much just walk on down. But the best part of all was actually having to go camp out in line for hours before the game. We used to make so many friends in those lines played SO much Egyptian Rat Screw (as was the style at the time) and sometimes you even got pizza handed to you by some (at the time) little-known bottom sixer like Max Talbot. Can you imagine?I know I'm in full-on old man mode now but honestly kids these days will never get to experience anything like that chapter of Pens fandom. I know student rush is still a thing but sniping the tickets online or whatever and then just showing up at the game like anyone else... it's just not the same. So glad to have had that experience; what a time.Oh yeah and the Pensblog was great too.

penguins,lxnv5cu,2024-11-17 17:24:48,Having that fucker go to Detroit because he felt they had a better chance to win and then seeing the camera feed of him in defeat the following year was fucking DELICIOUS.
penguins,lxmnuqz,2024-11-17 13:32:36,It’s one of those trades where you remember exactly where you were. Playing pickup basketball at the Y
penguins,lxnk402,2024-11-17 16:24:06,It was great trade for us. We were so close. It's sad that later Crosby couldn't close him although he tried to do his best. BTW I'm from Slovakia.
penguins,lxpl9td,2024-11-17 23:49:35,The only thing that bothers me out of that whole ordeal is that the Pens offered 7x7 and he turned it down.  After Detroit he goes to Chicago and gets the biggest cap circumventing contract out there with a $5 million cap hit.  The last years of that deal when he’s only getting $1 million per year he gets an allergy to his equipment and Chicago gets out from under that cap hit.  I hated the fact that the big market clubs could just pull shit like that.

penguins,lxtrmlt,2024-11-18 16:55:35,Hossa was a helluva player. I would’ve loved to of kept them but he absolutely hated Pittsburgh.
penguins,lxnra7q,2024-11-17 17:03:25,That was the real value in the trade. You get a player that played top 6 and could count on for 15+ goals and was a plus player. Same can be said of Brian Dumoulin. Sure the key return for Jordan Staal was the 1st round pick and Brandon Sutter. Instead they got a player that played top pair minutes for several years and 2 Stanley Cup runs.
penguins,lxnh4h3,2024-11-17 16:07:50,Dude I was *in town* for deadline when they got Iginla.  I was “…I wonder how long it’ll take to get the merch for sale?” Answer was “the next day.”I’ve got an Iginla tshirt.
penguins,lxmr3mq,2024-11-17 13:49:20,In fairness he did deliver for us for the short time he was here. Arguably our best defensive Forward on top of great scoring.I was really hopeful he'd get re-signed 
penguins,lxorfkk,2024-11-17 20:33:42,For Hossa it made sense third best player on the pens going to the team that just beat the pens for the cup shoulda been another cup. But Sid and Gino just cranked it way up
penguins,lxp2j6w,2024-11-17 21:42:19,Was he really that player anywhere else in the league?  I mean Hossa probably would have scored 50+ granted the salary could have been worked out.Sid/Hossa > Sid/DupuisThat was the only real winger they ever went out and got for Sid and they only played 30ish games together.  Would have been neat to see them stay together that following season because it appeared they built some chemistry
penguins,lxp94or,2024-11-17 22:24:27,Then Disco Dummy puts him on the wrong wing not the one where he's a soon to be HOFer. 
penguins,lxn2pvk,2024-11-17 14:51:00,he really was so good i had such hopes that he would stay!
penguins,lxp4pek,2024-11-17 21:55:47,Yeah WITH him we couldn’t manage the victory but AGAINST him we could. Haha suck it Hossa
penguins,lxplni4,2024-11-17 23:52:31,What’s that matter?  He was a key contributor while he was here. He wasn’t what brought in for that role. Hossa was acquired as a rental to play with Crosby. Dupuis wasn’t expected to be that player. He was the kind of player you needed on that line to help Crosby be successful.
penguins,lxqwpy2,2024-11-18 07:37:30,What matters is that Dupuis doesn't play on the top line on any other team in the NHL. So top line winger is a streeeetch.  Dupuis and Sid played well together but i would have much rather saw Sid get some time with an actual winger that belonged to be there going into his prime.Yes. I love Dupuis but he didn't break the top 6 on most NHL teams.  The Pens wanted to sign Hossa to play with Sid but he picked the wrong team and went to Detroit.
penguins,lxm8qj8,2024-11-17 12:09:56,This is not quiet or slow.  No one is under the impression they are making a cup run. The eller move had been in the works since summer. That was not a result of recent shitty play. Hockey trades are still what hes looking for but those hockey trades will also have picks attached as part of the mandate for the next phase.
penguins,lxm29x9,2024-11-17 11:34:21,quietly and slowly?dude he sold off at the deadline then sold off cap space all offseason to retain salary and take on bad contracts.what are you talking about quiet?
penguins,lxmnmfi,2024-11-17 13:31:22,Why are we posting this every day? We've been in an obvious rebuild since halfway through last season. It's slow because the options are very limited until some of these contacts can be moved off the books.Strap in everyone. We're only in the 2002 phase.
penguins,lxngb98,2024-11-17 16:03:32,Dubas is stuck in a tough spot.   With 71 & 87 you have to try and compete for a playoff spot and when you look at the roster the names there tell you that they should be doing just that.  But realistically it's an old team the coach and players are no longer meshing.  The D is horrible and the goaltending is worse. Can they rebuild on the fly sure.  But what are you going to get for the likes of Hayes Rakell Rust?   Middling players who you are then going to trade for more picks.
penguins,lxmdyup,2024-11-17 12:39:02,Agree. When they say he's looking for players back I'm assuming it will be bad contracts to maximize the picks we get in return and free up cap space for whatever team we're trading with. Like if we trade one of our 5 mil contracts to the Red Wings we'd probably have to take someone like Chiarot + multiple picks back for example.
penguins,lxn2laj,2024-11-17 14:50:18,If you are annoyed thinking this is posting every day. Why not ignore it?
penguins,lxnyvy5,2024-11-17 17:45:56,>With 71 & 87 you have to try and compete for a playoff spotNope. The job of a GM is to do everything he can to get a team closer to or ultimately win championships. Dubas' job isn't to emotionally support the core until they retire.If he looked at the team in the summer and saw no realistic way for them to be competitive he should have just torn it down. Well provided FSG is giving him the authority to do so which they claimed he did when he was hired.
penguins,lxmlco4,2024-11-17 13:19:21,Yeah that seems like the moves they’ll make for this trade deadline.  We’ll get some 3rd and 4th liners or bottom pair D plus a pick or two back for someone like Rakell.  Hopefully Pettersson can fetch us a first rounder.  Everyone seems to think he will at the deadline.
penguins,lxn3vu4,2024-11-17 14:57:22,It's just confusing. Did anyone look at this roster and think we were going to be competitive this year? Or did people think we were going to trade Jarry and Graves and get talent in return and be right back at the top?
penguins,lxnacfs,2024-11-17 15:32:20,>Did anyone look at this roster and think we were going to be competitive this year?A surprising amount of people on here did actually.
penguins,lxnzxmc,2024-11-17 17:51:55,Color me foolish but I did think we'd be fighting for a wild card and not just because I thought we'd be better this year but also because I knew the East would be wide open and it still is. Despite how dreadful we are the Pens are only two points out of a playoff spot while also being a few points from the bottom.I firmly believe there's way for this team to play that will make them better. Sullivan has this team playing like it's 2016. This team plays wide open north/south long stretch passes dmen constantly pinching hockey which is what leaves them so susceptible to turnovers and odd-man rushes because they can't play that system. They're not built for it.If this team played a more conservative system a tad more boring hockey? I absolutely believe they can fight for a WC spot. Yes the old adage that this team doesn't want to play that way but that is complete garbage. Look at Geno this year playing some of the most complete hockey of his career. Sid and Geno want to win and they'll play whatever style brings them success.

penguins,lxrioyd,2024-11-18 10:01:42,Just saw this vid and thought of your comment. It’s around 50 seconds in lol https://x.com/jmackeypg/status/1857966707836350615?s=46
penguins,lxpltvh,2024-11-17 23:53:52,Were you in the first row section 206 by chance?
penguins,lxn7ndu,2024-11-17 15:17:52,I think another city. Probably on twitter somewhere
penguins,lxn8n4x,2024-11-17 15:23:12,No worries ha!
penguins,lxrkchz,2024-11-18 10:11:10,Yesssss we got the first one! I think the second kid had a great hoodie if memory serves me correctly.
penguins,lxpscpb,2024-11-18 00:47:37,No I was in section 108...like halfway up row S..
penguins,lxn7ou0,2024-11-17 15:18:06,Still funny
penguins,lxoj78a,2024-11-17 19:43:46,Don’t you let that deal go down
penguins,lxm6uxg,2024-11-17 11:59:31,Historically these are highly sought after and get sold for a pretty penny on eBay. Good luck OP but I wouldn’t hold your breath.
penguins,lxnhdm9,2024-11-17 16:09:12,You had to buy the ticket package specifically to get one. I’m guessing those that bought the package did so because they wanted the shirt. It wasn’t a giveaway to anyone; if you didn’t want it you didn’t get it. So don’t expect many to be floating around out there.
penguins,lxmlwbw,2024-11-17 13:22:17,I want the yeehaw hat they dropped from the sky!  Didn’t catch one last night.Anyone getting rid of that.  Hello!
penguins,lxolec0,2024-11-17 19:56:52,Good luck with this. I picked up the Jewish heritage night promo last week and it was the best thing about that game (second best was Rust’s goal total beauty). I will say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the jersey. Gonna enjoy wearing it to future Pens games. They’ve got a lot of cool promo shirts this season; the Star Wars and especially the Black Hockey History ones look cool as hell.
penguins,lxp84z9,2024-11-17 22:17:55,Already one on eBay - buy it now is $250
penguins,lxm8z2h,2024-11-17 12:11:16,Man i wish i lived close enough to go to all these giveaway games
penguins,lxp2rw1,2024-11-17 21:43:48,https://inspirdg.com/product/pittsburgh-penguins-x-grateful-dead-night-special-white-hockey-jersey/There are a couple other similar designs available to order if you look around. Not sure how legit that site is though
penguins,lxlur6i,2024-11-17 10:52:25,Also interested if anyone's selling!
penguins,lxo7brh,2024-11-17 18:35:07,If anyone is selling hit me up
penguins,lxs064s,2024-11-18 11:35:46,Looks like there is another bid going on for about $106https://www.ebay.com/itm/186790078132?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=XfaXNgl5RIS&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=xjszajgjtsw&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY
penguins,lxoq5bw,2024-11-17 20:25:50,Don't feel too bad it wasn't a giveaway
penguins,lxrqqnj,2024-11-18 10:46:13,I have season tickets and I have yet to get one of the giveaways this year. It was like that last year too. They stopped producing as many and if you don’t get there super duper early you don’t get one. 90 mins early last time and they still didn’t have any left. It’s really annoying to see a bunch of people walking around with like five in their hands and my six-year-old kid is upset because he didn’t get a Mario Lemieux bobble head.
penguins,lxm021o,2024-11-17 11:22:11,Seconded!
penguins,lxs1gmo,2024-11-18 11:42:20,Oh that’s the one I saw but they removed buy it now.After looking at the jersey I think I like the concept more than the execution. Or at least I don’t like it enough to pay $100 plus.
penguins,lxs1pb8,2024-11-18 11:43:34,I like it and would probably wear it but I wouldn’t pay for it. I honestly don’t even like the Grateful Dead though I understand the draw and talent. Just not my cup of tea is all.
penguins,lxl6zem,2024-11-17 08:17:30,1-7-2
penguins,lxlbikn,2024-11-17 08:50:55,We won last night. Next ten? 10-0 baby. Flex seal stops leaks! Go Pens
penguins,lxl5mja,2024-11-17 08:06:55,Pain
penguins,lxlak69,2024-11-17 08:44:02,1-8-1. They'll lose to Utah in OT after blowing a 2 goal lead. They'll beat Colorado 8-2 because for some reason they own the Avs.
penguins,lxl95aa,2024-11-17 08:33:33,Well at least Boston is questionable? And maybe Winnipeg will be so demoralized from their two losses that we have a chance there too?
penguins,lxli70h,2024-11-17 09:36:51,7-2-1 that's right you heard me. Minimal travel and Sids big milestone coming up is going to give them a boost
penguins,lxlapqx,2024-11-17 08:45:09,I’ll be at the Vancouver game so I’m expecting them to get their clocks cleaned.
penguins,lxlv5vx,2024-11-17 10:54:46,Currently 1-9-2 against teams on pace for more than 85 points. That being said if we keep some of these kids in the lineup we’re righting the ship
penguins,lxl92i5,2024-11-17 08:32:55,LLWLWLLWWL
penguins,lxlrn00,2024-11-17 10:34:32,I’m gonna be the optimist and in the minority here… they’re gonna tear it the fuck up! They’re going 7-2-1…                (Losses to Winnipeg & Vancouver and Boston being a OT loss…. Then 5-0 on the last 5 with Rangers being an OT win)STOP LAUGHING Zero reason for me to pick any of these teams for wins or losses figured if I’m making a guess on the next 10 I’m going all in and being hopeful!
penguins,lxlaudh,2024-11-17 08:46:06,Many goals against  few goals for  Sid hits a milestone goal.
penguins,lxlcvb5,2024-11-17 09:00:34,Loss against all but Rangers
penguins,lxlh7fh,2024-11-17 09:30:22,Fuuuuuuuuck may the losing streak continue
penguins,lxlkbuv,2024-11-17 09:50:37,2-6-2 probably
penguins,lxlsp27,2024-11-17 10:40:37,I see evry loss being OTL
penguins,lxly16g,2024-11-17 11:10:55,1-9. Joel with a 50-save shutout vs Colorado after getting recalled.
penguins,lxmr9eh,2024-11-17 13:50:11,I’m glad they have a very tough schedule ahead of them.  It’ll expose the weakness of the team coaching and individual players. It’s a tough road to rebuild a team.  Might as well get it started and see who’s worth of putting in the effort and staying
penguins,lxlm9lk,2024-11-17 10:02:35,Could be A LOT ok losses there. Yikes
penguins,lxmfhmh,2024-11-17 12:47:30,4-5-1
penguins,lxngnc2,2024-11-17 16:05:16,They might be able to squeeze out a win against the Stormin Mormons
penguins,lxoy1kz,2024-11-17 21:14:29,I predict....1) Losing record in those 10 games2) At least one trade maybe two3) Sullivan keeps his job
penguins,lxpxa3d,2024-11-18 01:33:34,My prediction is that Sullivan will be fired before the end of those ten games.  It will be hard finding a ”young new coach with great system and coaching skills”. 
penguins,lxqh7el,2024-11-18 05:09:42,1-9-1We beat Toronto and lose in OT to Utah
penguins,lxs3shm,2024-11-18 11:54:05,7-8 pts is my prediction.  3-5-2 or 3-6-1 something like that (being kind of optimistic)
penguins,lxl9cry,2024-11-17 08:35:09,What's the one win?
penguins,lxl9g7z,2024-11-17 08:35:52,I think those are the two I'd give us the best chance in. I think we'll win two of Boston Winnipeg Calgary and Vancouver but definitely not all 4. Rest I would say are L's.
penguins,lxl9c5j,2024-11-17 08:35:01,I think we will win two. I think we'll really struggle against Utah honestly.
penguins,lxldxyx,2024-11-17 09:08:08,You think we'll take revenge for the home opener?
penguins,lxlpzik,2024-11-17 10:24:51,Sounds about right.
penguins,lxrg1bb,2024-11-18 09:46:15,I could see it. I have a feeling though that Utah is going to be a really really difficult game. They're a very fast team and I think they will badly outstate us.
penguins,lxldhjk,2024-11-17 09:04:56,Winnipeg lmao
penguins,lxlid5n,2024-11-17 09:37:59,Winnipeg is on a losing streak. They lost one in a row so you never know.
penguins,lxlmc5i,2024-11-17 10:03:02,That would be so Penguins 
penguins,lxmkne2,2024-11-17 13:15:37,I mean they lost 4-1 to Tampa and got shut out 5-0 by Florida travel back to Winnipeg to play Florida *again* and then fly here to us. It's kind of wonky
penguins,lxjhgva,2024-11-16 22:38:23,Better'n that Crosby guy already.
penguins,lxjnpu7,2024-11-16 23:22:57,Crosby was a monster tonight. He normally is. But I feel like he was even better than normal
penguins,lxji482,2024-11-16 22:42:43,I've seen enough throw Grzelcyk in the trash.
penguins,lxjhjie,2024-11-16 22:38:54,We missed him tonight in WBS. Great night for him though!
penguins,lxjkvxy,2024-11-16 23:01:56,Solid effort from EK65
penguins,lxjs4do,2024-11-16 23:56:50,Can’t wait for Sully to scratch him when Letang is healthy 
penguins,lxl6eqh,2024-11-17 08:13:03,How tf do you read these charts?
penguins,lxjnyi9,2024-11-16 23:24:46,A surprisingly strong rookie debut would be so so nice.
penguins,lxjtccu,2024-11-17 00:06:31,So damn happy for him. Shot him a text after the game. Can’t wait for him to have NHL cards that I can track down and collect!
penguins,lxlgg43,2024-11-17 09:25:17,Gotta trade Grzelkjlijiejkcjk to ANYONE willing to take him. Seems like a player EDM would love.
penguins,lxmgxn0,2024-11-17 12:55:26,Don't worry Sully will coach that out of him.
penguins,lxn6uwa,2024-11-17 15:13:38,He hasn’t been Sullivized yet. Give it time. He’ll be milquetoast and underwhelming before you know it.
penguins,lxnb6j9,2024-11-17 15:36:52,Hopefully he and Brunicke will be pillars on our defence for many years.
penguins,lxjje46,2024-11-16 22:51:22,What’s the main sub?
penguins,lxoj0cr,2024-11-17 19:42:37,Ponomarev is a bust
penguins,lxjj9bt,2024-11-16 22:50:26,Is ponomarev having a rough time transitioning? Saw him on the worst team of the week by stats on the main sub.
penguins,lxjii70,2024-11-16 22:45:21,Old man outplayed by the rookie. A tale as old as time
penguins,lxjoq4l,2024-11-16 23:30:40,Seems like Sid and the team are being very intentional about getting him 600 so he’s taking more shots and being set up for more by the team. It’s making him more noticeable but I don’t think he’s playing particularly more or less impactful just different.
penguins,lxjjk85,2024-11-16 22:52:32,I’m going to be honest I didn’t even need to see Pickering tonight to come to that conclusion.
penguins,lxk323l,2024-11-17 01:29:02,That hurts me. Sully and Quinny might have a small soft spot for him too. Though there’s also a part that hates the Bruins and he was there way too long for me to ever like him again. 
penguins,lxjqpkg,2024-11-16 23:46:07,He’s been an enigma on these cards this year. Elite offensive performance most games with some mediocre to really bad defense balancing him out; unfortunately we don’t have a single d man posting a positive defensive rating. That says a lot about our system imo. All that being said he’s the only D man with a positive rating overall. I definitely like him more than most of the sub and I think a lot of the hate he gets is because of expectations that came with his name and cap hit as he hasn’t been noticeably worse than Tanger Grizlick or Dragon defensively to me.
penguins,lxnt8vl,2024-11-17 17:14:15,You know him? Very cool!
penguins,lxjjlcc,2024-11-16 22:52:45,What do you mean?
penguins,lxjk7m4,2024-11-16 22:57:06,Pretty sure that was Puustinen tonight was pono’s first game in the show
penguins,lxjjpng,2024-11-16 22:53:36,Imo he played good sometimes advanced stats just don’t tell the whole story
penguins,lxjr090,2024-11-16 23:48:26,He wasn't brought here to play elite defense.  But without anyone else playing solid D it puts him (and Tanger) in a bad position.
penguins,lxnzxlg,2024-11-17 17:51:54,I worked with his junior team for the first three years of his time there. Got to know him very well. I put this video together when he got drafted. https://x.com/scbroncos/status/1545405965440360450?s=46
penguins,lxjngl3,2024-11-16 23:20:58,Guy under said stats on the main sub
penguins,lxjkh63,2024-11-16 22:58:59,*First game with the pensBut you’re correct on that first part. Puusty is also currently the pens worst skater based on his average gamescore.
penguins,lxjp38a,2024-11-16 23:33:30,i thought pono played 3 games for carolina last season
penguins,lxjk2do,2024-11-16 22:56:06,This. Pono didn’t play bad at all but he had played very sheltered minutes and took a penalty. It unfairly tanked his gamescore tonight. He had a couple great moments in the offensive zone and I can’t recall any notable bad play in the d zone.
penguins,lxjrgyy,2024-11-16 23:51:56,I agree both of them would be better suited in a system that lets them start the play from the point and then skate deeper down to stay involved in the O zone with a good backchecking forward cycling back to the blue line in their steed. Unfortunately if it hasn’t changed by now I don’t see any reason it would eventually.
penguins,lxlj2rq,2024-11-17 09:42:37,I'd be happy with mediocre defense.
penguins,lxjnyc0,2024-11-16 23:24:44,Ah gotcha. [Here you go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/s/nTbHchn94U) r/hockey puts this up weekly and it uses the same models these statcards do.
penguins,lxjr4bv,2024-11-16 23:49:18,2 games but yeah.

penguins,lxjb8fq,2024-11-16 21:56:19,That game was against the Sharks. Don’t get your hopes up. That being said the young guys looked very fun.
penguins,lxjb272,2024-11-16 21:55:09,It's actually fucking depressing how every single lead is blown this year.
penguins,lxjbfqf,2024-11-16 21:57:39,Even our wins are embarrassing
penguins,lxjb5sm,2024-11-16 21:55:49,WE'RE NOT THE WORST!  WE'RE NOT THE WORST!   WE'RE NOT THE WORST!
penguins,lxjb3l2,2024-11-16 21:55:25,Geno bullying the youth. <3
penguins,lxjb7ka,2024-11-16 21:56:09,Blackwood played like a fucking BEAST in 3 on 3 OT. Glad wrong got the 2 points even though we should be better than this.
penguins,lxjbgnw,2024-11-16 21:57:50,didn’t get to watch how was pickering
penguins,lxjcde9,2024-11-16 22:03:54,WE WONFIRE MIKE SULLIVAN
penguins,lxjbcjk,2024-11-16 21:57:04,Blew the lead as per usual.  BUT.... we won.Woot!

penguins,lxjb392,2024-11-16 21:55:21,We won. Still fire Mike Sullivan.
penguins,lxjbrxz,2024-11-16 21:59:54,That OT point could come back to haunt the Sharks in the Hagens sweepstakes.
penguins,lxjb9fj,2024-11-16 21:56:29,give Sully a ticket to the ceremony when Sid gets his 600th but don't let him back behind the bench after this weekend.
penguins,lxjbrsd,2024-11-16 21:59:52,There was no chance Sid wasn’t getting the SO goal after Blackwood stopped him so many times in OT. He had *that look* on his face. If nothing else besides the two points those were some beautiful SO goals…
penguins,lxji7uj,2024-11-16 22:43:24,That was my first game and man what a great time! I got a warm up puck met Iceburgh and got to see a win!
penguins,lxjdbw1,2024-11-16 22:10:21,If there's ever been a W that's felt more like an L this was it.
penguins,lxje3qm,2024-11-16 22:15:32,9 goals given up to the jackets and sharkswe were one goal away from be free of this bum head coach !!
penguins,lxjhm2b,2024-11-16 22:39:23,"I Can / Cannot Get Excited About....1) I Can get excited about a win2) I Cannot get excited about a win between two teams who will be competing for a top-5 pick in next year's draft3) I Can get excited about the intensity and or speed of the ""youngsters""4) I Cannot get excited about a game where we're just happy our 10.5 M dollar defenseman didn't cost us the game5) I Can get excited about a S/O where our two oldest players both scored6) I Cannot get excited about a game where the team blew a two goal lead (AGAIN) with 11:00 to play.7) I Can get excited because Ned played decent to well8) I Cannot get excited because our ""defense"" was often closer to some dude selling popcorn in the stands than a Sharks player. (Seriously adopt a Safety mentality...to wit: ""NOBODY GETS BEHIND YOU"")9) I Can get excited because # 87 is close to a PPG and # 71 is still a force. 10) I Cannot get excited because at the end of the day Sully is still our coach and this team desperately needs a change in voice in the locker room. (And defensive end)"
penguins,lxjbjd4,2024-11-16 21:58:20,I'll take the 2 points but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PRACTICE DEFENSE MORE
penguins,lxjbjrn,2024-11-16 21:58:24,Couldn’t watch the game. How did Pickering look?
penguins,lxjknjy,2024-11-16 23:00:15,I am so proud to be a Geno fan this season. He has been amazing!
penguins,lxjbqif,2024-11-16 21:59:39,It should not have been that hard against the sharks for heaven's sake
penguins,lxjeprv,2024-11-16 22:19:34,Lucky win. Multi goal lead blown again
penguins,lxjbro9,2024-11-16 21:59:51,Now everybody's dancin' down the local armory  With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery  Temperature keeps risin' everybody gettin' high  Come the rockin' end of shootout the place is gonna fly uh-huh.... ONE MORE SATURDAY NIGHT!
penguins,lxjc8m7,2024-11-16 22:02:59,Really thought that nutshot to the linesman was a sign.  Almost...
penguins,lxk3khp,2024-11-17 01:33:25,Ponomarev played quite well. Looked fast responsible showed some vision. Glad to see something so quickly out of the Canes trade
penguins,lxjd5sw,2024-11-16 22:09:14,I’m going to start betting the other team to score 2+ goals in the 3rd when we have a 2 goal lead going in
penguins,lxjdrrq,2024-11-16 22:13:19,"Couldn't watch. Is this a ""We won and we don't care how"" game or a ""We needed the shootout to beat the fucking Sharks!?!?!?"" game?"
penguins,lxjdudr,2024-11-16 22:13:49,Sad win
penguins,lxjee7t,2024-11-16 22:17:25,Woohoo! I’m 3-0 for OT at home!
penguins,lxjkdn5,2024-11-16 22:58:19,"much as yet another blown lead stings at least this time it wasn't the type of inexplicable total collapse in just a couple minutes that they've had a few times this season. the sharks put in a lot of work to make that comeback it was a really entertaining game overall to watch. especially that long stretch without a whistle early in the third with chances at both ends was really exciting. OT is always fun to see too. i don't really like SOs but i'm happy to see Ned come thru and make the game-winning save there. btw kinda like CGY isn't as good as their hot start made them seem SJS isn't as bad as their awful start made them seem. their current road trip before tonight was SJS 1-0 NJD SJS 3 - 4 (SO) PHI SJS 2-3 NYR. most of their losses this season are by a pretty small margin the worst is 8-3 and that was vs the winningest jets.saying all this cause saw a lot of comments both during the game and earlier this week that seemed to reflect a mindset akin to ""anything but an overwhelming win vs SJS would be an embarrassment"" which imo really isn't fair to either team especially to SJS. sure they are one of the worst teams in the NHL rn but Pens are not much ahead and more to the point the parity in NHL is so high that even the top teams couldn't really justify going into a game vs SJS with the assumption that it's gonna be an easy W. the main reason for why playoffs are a Bo7 series is that any single game can go either way whereas a longer series increases confidence in the result actually reflecting which team is better."
penguins,lxjmojr,2024-11-16 23:15:10, 17 of 20 games this season we have given up 3 or more goals. The only impressive team we held under 3 goals was Washington (currently 2nd in GF/GP) other two were Montreal and Anaheim.Something really needs to change defensively/defensive system.You can blame Jarry all you want but he’s only played in 4 of those 20 games there’s something more there.
penguins,lxjtf9l,2024-11-17 00:07:10,I would seriously bring graves back in and put pickering with Letang when he returns. Gryz is hot garbage there anyway. At this point why not?
penguins,lxjb83t,2024-11-16 21:56:15,Pathetic
penguins,lxjbm74,2024-11-16 21:58:51,Broadcast said Pickering was the player of the game? Guy had the least TOI
penguins,lxje5aq,2024-11-16 22:15:49,Pickering with the interview chops.
penguins,lxjeiwx,2024-11-16 22:18:17,Graves healthy scratch? Can we put him on waivers?
penguins,lxjmczo,2024-11-16 23:12:48,We’re back baby!
penguins,lxjsmvl,2024-11-17 00:00:52,That was an ugly win but it’s a win anyway and I’ll take it
penguins,lxjt2n0,2024-11-17 00:04:21,Flex seal!
penguins,lxk1in8,2024-11-17 01:15:21,"""GO BACK TO THE OCEAN WHERE YOU BELONG"" I shouted at the teal bastards. I'm glad today wasn't the day we lose to a city where there is no ice. Watching that shootout up close was just fantastic. It was an entertaining game."
penguins,lxl8dg2,2024-11-17 08:28:03,A win is a win.  The win covers up continuing underlying issues not resolved.Blowing leads and not staying in games are costly.  Refer back to the 4-3 OTL against the Islanders and the 6-2 L against the Blue Jackets.Younger players are playing better than tenured players excluding Crosby.  Dubas needs to have that conversation with Sullivan.
penguins,lxlzqu8,2024-11-17 11:20:28,Sids goal felt like “hey Erik this is how it’s done see? shit goalie got that i’ll try the other corner real quick”
penguins,lxjcmhz,2024-11-16 22:05:35,Yeah I don't really care about how the team does at this point I just want the young guys to look good. Pickering definitely had a good game.I wish they'd give Ponomarev more ice time but Pickering looked really nice.
penguins,lxjbkmm,2024-11-16 21:58:34,Blowing leads almost every three games! And the other two games they're getting blown tf out. Who's having fun??
penguins,lxjer9a,2024-11-16 22:19:51,Hasn’t this been the M.O. the past few years
penguins,lxjjveq,2024-11-16 22:54:43,It's been years of this to be fair
penguins,lxjc0cv,2024-11-16 22:01:26,Yet
penguins,lxjbxpp,2024-11-16 22:00:57,Good! Got his first NHL point made good defensive plays and smart decisions. Best part of the game for me!
penguins,lxjc1gm,2024-11-16 22:01:39,I’d rather him be on the Penguins than Shea St Ivany or Gryz.
penguins,lxjddcz,2024-11-16 22:10:37,The SNP crew named him the player of the game looked really good out there
penguins,lxjep1n,2024-11-16 22:19:26,He was a defensive net front machine. Pushing shoving. Staying below the offense played above expectations.
penguins,lxjbwqa,2024-11-16 22:00:46,Lol!! This is the top comment.
penguins,lxjk0nv,2024-11-16 22:55:46,The schedule for the next 10 is brutal. I am sure we'll win 1 or 2 but I honestly don't see 1 win looking at that schedule.
penguins,lxjbueg,2024-11-16 22:00:20,I think he did well
penguins,lxjcoli,2024-11-16 22:05:59,We're the same level as them. Seems like a fair result.
penguins,lxjf09z,2024-11-16 22:21:32,Massive roi
penguins,lxjk887,2024-11-16 22:57:14,Just two bottom 5 teams battling it out. Classic blown 3 goal lead. On a team level I have no positives to take away. On an individual level Pickering was fantastic. Ponomorev and Poulin both played well. Crosby and Malkin were great.
penguins,lxjvyh0,2024-11-17 00:28:19,>Something really needs to change defensively/defensive systemDavid Quinn for startersLeague 18th PP isn't worth being dead last in GA/GP. Much like last year with Reirden though they won't make a change there until the off-season. Results are whatever.
penguins,lxje57d,2024-11-16 22:15:48,He was third star
penguins,lxjcff7,2024-11-16 22:04:16,He missed the 2nd period outside of like a shift I think.
penguins,lxjkrwe,2024-11-16 23:01:08,Geno was first star.
penguins,lxjqeae,2024-11-16 23:43:43,He has natural leadership traits. Felt that way when he was 18 y/o already.
penguins,lxjgl4b,2024-11-16 22:32:16,Yes. But he would most like clear waivers this early in the season. They would need to trade him.
penguins,lxjlp9z,2024-11-16 23:07:54,The degree to which it's happened this year is far worse than the past 3 seasons. Smaller sample size but it's gotta be close to 90%
penguins,lxjie7e,2024-11-16 22:44:36,Rock bottom baby! Here we come!
penguins,lxjdi9k,2024-11-16 22:11:33,Well he was already replacing Graves right? Isn’t that good enough?
penguins,lxjyp1x,2024-11-17 00:50:34,Add EK to your list.
penguins,lxjf61r,2024-11-16 22:22:37,Exactly. The two teams are very even. However the sharks will likely get better as the season goes on and Smith/Celebrini get more time. The Penguins will likely get worse especially after deadline. So could see us ending with a higher pick than the Sharks.
penguins,lxjhmrv,2024-11-16 22:39:31,Ah ok. Graves and Jarry straight up for McDavid and Draisaitl.
penguins,lxjebbf,2024-11-16 22:16:54,Graves aint that bad anymore he's mid instead of trash so he improved a little but he's just a scapegoat at this point far from the worst guy on that defense
penguins,lxjf9a9,2024-11-16 22:23:13,In a room full of clowns he’s no longer the worst? (I kid; I’ve watched every game and see marked improvement in his game but he’s being paid as a top four d man and performing admirably in the bottom pairing - not good enough.)
penguins,lxj7ves,2024-11-16 21:33:56,Can we please STOP with the revisionist history? Granlund's contract made no sense and now he's the top line center and his stats reflect that and good for him. We would be shitting on his contract if we kept him anyway.
penguins,lxj68zu,2024-11-16 21:23:10,Remember Karlsson's production on the Sharks? Being the best player getting maximum minutes on a shitty team does wonders for your stats.Mix that with Sullivan nerfing every player that pulls on this jersey and you get the Pittsburgh Penguins experience post-2017.
penguins,lxl191o,2024-11-17 07:30:22,It was good to see him score last night after the idiots in the crowd booed him as if he was the problem the last 5 years.
penguins,lxjg8v9,2024-11-16 22:29:55,They never gave him a chance.
penguins,lxj67lk,2024-11-16 21:22:55,I’ve said this since he was traded. The issue with Granlund was him being put on the third line with a second year DOC and Ryan Poehling.Granlund is a top six player that was put into a bottom six role with players that were not good. Granlund wasn’t going to succeed in the position he was put in here.I honestly think he would have done really well with Malkin last season with Zucker gone but we never got to see that due to him being traded.I think he would have done better than Smith did last season.I’ve always been very firm about hate the trade not the player.
penguins,lxj75u0,2024-11-16 21:29:18,Nah even with Karlsson not coming as advertised I can't reasonably see the Pens being a better team with all those bloated contracts and roster spots occupied.Glad he seems to be doing well though
penguins,lxj5tdt,2024-11-16 21:20:19,I remember thinking we paid way too much for him and he delivered nothing.
penguins,lxj88a0,2024-11-16 21:36:20,Granlund wasn’t that good when we acquired him from Nashville. How quickly we forget/are willing to do some revisionist history: https://x.com/JFreshHockey/status/1631096253047087104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1631096253047087104%7Ctwgr%5Ed920a9ea164be51745aa8c65580b09328d937c61%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pensburgh.com%2F2023%2F3%2F1%2F23621413%2Freport-penguins-acquire-mikael-granlund-from-nashville-predators-pens-trade-predators
penguins,lxj7005,2024-11-16 21:28:13,How many players have come to our team not played well and then played amazing after they left (or before they showed up)? At some point we have to call it a coaching issue right?
penguins,lxjzzx6,2024-11-17 01:01:33,I honestly think he would have done well on the second line with Malkin and Rakell. His issue here was being put on a line with Poehling who’s a 4th liner at best and 2nd season O’Connor.The trade never made sense because it was something the Penguins didn’t need. We needed depth but not in the form of a $5 million playmaker that needs players who can finish.Granlund averages 55 points across 82 games. I feel he would have done well with Malkin.
penguins,lxj8wdp,2024-11-16 21:40:47,It’s just for fun don’t get angry lol
penguins,lxjgt6f,2024-11-16 22:33:50,The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. It was an awful trade made absolutely no sense. But I also do think Granlund was just not a good fit for the system at all. He is not as bad as he was when he played for us but also it was an awful trade. Our system is just very one style fits all to the point where I think a lot of players without speed as their main trait struggle.
penguins,lxj87p3,2024-11-16 21:36:13,Granlund has put up 60 point seasons.Issue was here he was getting third line minutes with Ryan Poehling (whose career high in a season is 11 goals) and a second season DOC.I think he would have done well last season if he was put with Crosby or Malkin. I think be would have done better than Smith
penguins,lxj5wwu,2024-11-16 21:20:57,Same buddy I thought we won this trade 1000%
penguins,lxjzexw,2024-11-17 00:56:36,Granlund has speed and playmaking ability. He’s strength is passing. Issue here is he was put on a third line with 7 goal career high (at the time) Poehling and second season still a rookie O’Connor.Granlund averages 55 points across 82 games throughout his career.The trade was just a horrible trade because we traded for a top six player when there was no room in our top six.I do remember he played some time with Malkin and the two looked really good together Malkin struggled to finish some of his playmaking plays.I feel he would have done well on the second line last season with Zucker gone. I do believe he would have done better than Reilly Smith.
penguins,lxj8tsm,2024-11-16 21:40:19,He has 4 in 14 seasons. Let’s not pretend 60 point seasons are his average/norm.
penguins,lxqbs0e,2024-11-18 04:08:37,"This is exactly the point that majority of hockey ""experts"" miss. Playing with mediocre checking line players and minimal pp time. Same happened in Predators with Laviolette. 1st pp line was set in stone and with given no 1 center Ryan Johansen who couldn't keep up."
penguins,lxky6a8,2024-11-17 07:01:25,I thought the trade was awful because we gave up a 2nd when it was clear that we should have been selling at the deadline. Granlund would have been much better on Malkin's line his passing ability would have suited him well there.
penguins,lxjakka,2024-11-16 21:51:55,562 points in 837 games which comes to 55 points average across 82 games.
penguins,lxm4jla,2024-11-17 11:46:46,I’m 100% not defending the trade by any means. The trade was awful because there was no good spot for Granlund but that’s not Granlund’s fault.This fanbase acts like Granlund is a terrible player who should not be paid the contract he was given.Zucker got a $5 million while averaging 43 points across 82 games. Penguins are paying Rakell $5 million while he averages 50 points across 82 games.
penguins,lxjb1b1,2024-11-16 21:54:59,That’s the mistake everyone makes with averages. If there’s 4/14 seasons that are 60+ plus that means those are outliers. His norm is NOT 60 point seasons.
penguins,lxmanur,2024-11-17 12:20:42,I don't disagree at all. Your not wrong
penguins,lxjb4od,2024-11-16 21:55:37,55 points is not far off 60 points though.
penguins,lxjb75k,2024-11-16 21:56:05,But that’s besides the point he’s not great Sullivan didn’t nerf him and he’s doing better in SJ because he’s the guy.
penguins,lxjc0gj,2024-11-16 22:01:27,Sullivan didn’t nerf him here. There was no room in the top six because we had Guentzel Rust Rakell and Zucker. He didn’t fit here.He was then put with Poehling and O’Connor.He’s a top six caliber offense-man but needs top six caliber linemates to succeed.I strongly believe he would have succeeded with Malkin and Rakell last season and would have done a lot better than Reilly Smith did.As I said he averages 55 points across 82 games which is nothing to scoff at. Put him with Malkin and he’s most likely getting those 60 points.
canucks,lxu7oxn,2024-11-18 18:23:13,Cheapest game would be Columbus.Bruins game is a HNIC game on a Saturday it won’t be cheap.Best value would probably be Avalanche on December 16. Good players on both sides and usually make an exciting game. A Monday night game is also cheaper than weekend games.Now: if you don’t mind delaying it until January I would recommend going to a game in Seattle on Jan 2. Given our poor home record a road game might be more fun to watch. Seattle also has a lot of Canucks fans in the building. Pretty good atmosphere for a game down there as well.
canucks,lxu7nft,2024-11-18 18:22:59,I’d say Bruins just because the fandom kinda has a rivalry ever since that cup run. I like being on the sides of the ice so I can see everything opposed to being behind one net but everyone is different
canucks,lxu8676,2024-11-18 18:25:59,it all depends. those games are going to be pricey either way but both teams are doing meh so should be decent matcch ups (the avs definetly can score in bunches though that would be my biggest issue. lower bowl will probably be near 200 each for those
canucks,lxttyqs,2024-11-18 17:07:39,I know the focus is on miller but with the exception of Petey that was an extremely weak PK.  Both D and miller basically stationary one hand on the stick and barely even waving or threatening the PP with it.  Just putting it out there and hoping you intercept a pass.
canucks,lxtvaig,2024-11-18 17:14:43,JT effort or movement here aside I think it's absolutely insane that Petey was basically expected here to cover 3 guys on the PK while JT covered 1 guy and our 2 dmen covered another.
canucks,lxts75x,2024-11-18 16:58:30,Must have hurt his ankles on Halloween
canucks,lxtv32m,2024-11-18 17:13:36,Something I wanna mention is in Langley on Friday he looked fucking terrible. Like super depressed and zero energy. I get its a public signing event and he can be a ‘emotionless’ guy at times but he seemed worse than normal (this was day after Islanders game). To then have to play Saturday and Sunday I can imagine he could use this break after the Rangers game (4days) more than anyone
canucks,lxtqr8d,2024-11-18 16:51:10,He’s playing zone d. The zone is just very small
canucks,lxtu1h7,2024-11-18 17:08:03,Not using his left hand much
canucks,lxtx0r8,2024-11-18 17:24:00,Miller's play aside here. I don't really get the train of thought in a passive pk. We get peppered with shots goalie often can't see a thing they have sustained o-zone for almost the entirety of the pp assuming they get entry. Aggressive PKs stonewall us to great effect (iirc edm did used it against us in the playoffs). With our good forecheck and high energy game wouldn't it make more sense to run an aggressive pk?
canucks,lxtpnsx,2024-11-18 16:45:39,This is like me passively playing defense to teach my u11 soccer drills
canucks,lxtuufi,2024-11-18 17:12:20,Petey: Who’s the fucking baby now bitch
canucks,lxtqxhu,2024-11-18 16:52:04,Crazy how him and petey just completely swapped situations
canucks,lxtvp8g,2024-11-18 17:16:53,Just sit him a game. Not because this shift but for rest. Dudes been playing hurt and plays a tough brand of hockey.
canucks,lxtw9ua,2024-11-18 17:19:59,Yeah I don’t fully believe that he isn’t hurt in some way despite what Tocc said. Dude’s struggling w something I wish he can put aside his usual toughing it out through pain and just rest for a bit. That or maybe it’s an internal systems/cultural issue of expecting players to tough it out rather than taking a break when needed. Regardless playing like this clearly isn’t helping him physically or emotionally.
canucks,lxtwww4,2024-11-18 17:23:25,Isn’t JT  Ricks favourite. And isn’t Rick a gambling man?
canucks,lxtyroe,2024-11-18 17:33:22,yeah millers been bad even if he is injured. but people ripping on him like he isn't the heart and soul of this team is wild.
canucks,lxu0yy8,2024-11-18 17:45:13,He should not have been on this PK in the first place. What he does well at as a PKer is scoring SH goals (or at least generating SH chances) and taking draws. His hand is cooked so he can't do either. Get him off.
canucks,lxtx522,2024-11-18 17:24:38,I could've done more and I can barely skate
canucks,lxu043t,2024-11-18 17:40:34,Everyone focusing on Miller allowing the cross ice pass to Stamkos but to me Miller just letting Marchy tee off before the Stamkos goal was just as egregious.
canucks,lxu13v8,2024-11-18 17:45:58,Evidence that his shoulder is still bugging him he can't open the map to see where he should be
canucks,lxu4dy6,2024-11-18 18:04:10,Just have 3 guys stand in front of Stamkos
canucks,lxu9o8u,2024-11-18 18:34:43,JT a supervisor on the PK lol what the fuck dude what is going on with him this year 
canucks,lxua3ny,2024-11-18 18:37:12,I saw the highlight and wasn't paying full attention so I actually thought Petey was the problem here... but my god. He was all over his side of the ice. If he did anything wrong it was simply not yelling at the other guys to cover maybe one more fucking person? Cut off a single lane or option?I'm used to d-men being stationary but it's fair to say Miller didn't have the fight in him on this PK and I get why he wasn't getting minutes after this.
canucks,lxtxbyz,2024-11-18 17:25:40,Pylon
canucks,lxty09c,2024-11-18 17:29:16,I hate stationary PK. The Oilers PK was so aggressive in the playoffs and I think that is what caused us so many problems
canucks,lxttfry,2024-11-18 17:04:55,That damn pumpkin patch mud
canucks,lxtygxe,2024-11-18 17:31:46,my coworker was just telling me this exact same thing and he showed me a pic miller looked absolutely depressed. something is definitely up!! apparently he could barely even pretend to care when a kid came up to him
canucks,lxu92w0,2024-11-18 18:31:14,We should cut him some slack having to do a fan signing in Langley plus back 2 back home games and media probably exhausted him.
canucks,lxuafqi,2024-11-18 18:39:09,“What is this? A zone for ants??”
canucks,lxtvfov,2024-11-18 17:15:28,There's a video of warm up of him shooting and then shaking out his hand. He's definitely dealing with an injury. There was talk about it earlier this season too. Must still be bothering him.
canucks,lxtqstm,2024-11-18 16:51:24,The audacity of him trying to direct Petey while Miller didn't lift his foot off the ice for a single stride
canucks,lxtv7eq,2024-11-18 17:14:15,Petey never fell off defensively during his slump
canucks,lxtz1z8,2024-11-18 17:34:54,Petey is a vampire feeding off Miller confirmed
canucks,lxtzu9z,2024-11-18 17:39:07,I never understand why more teams don’t do this
canucks,lxtwjc4,2024-11-18 17:21:24,Even harder in heels
canucks,lxu2qyt,2024-11-18 17:54:58,I just want a game or two where everyone is healthy and firing on all cylinders it's not to much to ask for is it?
canucks,lxtsrvy,2024-11-18 17:01:27,I heard on TV someone yelled Petey a couple times and it had him all flustered at the end when the Preds scored thought it was a Preds player not JT lol
canucks,lxtwawu,2024-11-18 17:20:08,We’re watching the same clip right? What lane is Pettersson covering? Miller laziness aside the literal worst thing that could have happened is the pucking going cross ice through the slot to one of the best powerplay shooting options in the league who literally just scored the powerplay before and he left it wide open to cheat towards forsberg
canucks,lxu2m3w,2024-11-18 17:54:13,Because being overly aggressive on the PK gets you burned too. It’s the same reason you don’t see hunting for big hits. If you miss it’s an off man rush the other way. Maintaining structure while being aggressive is hard and exhausting.
canucks,lxu9rph,2024-11-18 18:35:17,It’s the risk tolerance of the coach.  Being aggressive  scrambling and playing with force can create situations where you find yourself outnumbered or in bad situations.  But the flip side is this PK - largely passive and stationary and we are relying on the other team to make a mistake or our goaltending to bail us out.  Pros and cons to each approach.
canucks,lxtzb2n,2024-11-18 17:36:16,He cheats towards forsberg… because JT Miller isnt doing shit about forsbergEither JT has to challenge Marchessault off the puck or cover forsberg.  He does neither hence why Petey cheated over.  Yeah Petey made a mistake but he’s also covering 3 guys at once
canucks,lxu0afs,2024-11-18 17:41:31,i’m sorry but Petey’s literally covering nothing.Explain to me what lane he’s covering when the pass is made look at the distance he is from every player stick length wise. everyones going off the deep end looking for a reason to crown Petey and go tee off on JT. you can at least be objective and say JT was lazy and petey was making horrible reads.this sub thinks Elias is back and dominating yet he’s still getting outproduced by JT at his so called worst.
canucks,lxu1yt0,2024-11-18 17:50:39,Then explain to me what JT is covering thenHis job is to contain a right shot player on the right side.  He doesn’t even have to worry about the shotFirst he gives up a free one timer to Forsberg.  Then after his only job is to not let the pass go through the middle he allows the pass to the middle the most dangerous area on the power playYou’re only comments in this sub have been bashing on Petey and frankly it’s embarrassing that we have fans like this that won’t offer any other meaningful points of discussion and are only here to hate watch one player
canucks,lxu5oj4,2024-11-18 18:11:36,the irony of your comment in a JT hate thread lol.and your back to whataboutism. you can’t answer the question i originally asked. i literally called out JT for being lazy. he’s not containing play him allowing the initial pass to the inside of forsberg that he bumped back to the outside was dogshit.the worst part of the shift is still Elias letting the cross ice pass for the goal against. are you going to argue he’s not the main reason the pucks in the back of the net? i’d love for you to find a high level analysis of why that was the proper read.
canucks,lxu6sc8,2024-11-18 18:17:59,My brother I answered your question.  He should be covering stamkos but cheats over to forsberg because JT isn’t covering himBlaming the guy trying to fill the holes in the defense rather than blaming the literalhuman traffic cone is an interesting decisionFor parts of the season the Petey criticism was justifiable.  And right now the JT criticism is completely justifiable.  But blaming Petey on this play where he’s the only one actually showing effort is wild to me
canucks,lxu91ne,2024-11-18 18:31:02,He’s filling 0 holes.As seen by the result he’s in no position to stop the pass to stamkos.he’s in no position to alter any play to the point.he’s on the wrong side and no position to stop a pass being made to forsberg.but because he skates after a bobbled puck on the halfwall leading them to moving it around the horn you’re arguing he made a good play.you wouldn’t find anyone anywhere other than /r/canucks that would be arguing that was the right read.

canucks,lxta9fy,2024-11-18 15:28:03,Nearly 20 min a night and 1 apple to show for it while also being bad defensively is a terrible look. What happened?
canucks,lxt6lez,2024-11-18 15:09:14,He's been so clumsy. I know he isn't a native offensive Dman but last year I was pleasantly surprised that he was competent at making simple plays to help move the puck on top of his defensive sturdiness. This year he's missing defensive coverages struggling to settle pucks launching passes into feet and blowing his edges while attempting to keep his gap in the defensive zone. It's like he's taken a notable hit to his dexterity.
canucks,lxt9ubb,2024-11-18 15:25:55,Going into this season looking at Soucy/Myers being the 2nd pair the most optimistic of us all hoped that they would be adequate. We lost a 2nd pair and now we have our bottom pair taking on a lot of hard minutes so it's expected. Benching Soucy isn't going to do much. Bench the GM for putting Soucy and the team in this situation
canucks,lxty0ub,2024-11-18 17:29:21,I think this is a systemic thing the whole team is playing scared right now either doing too much and making stupid plays. They need to bring it back to the simple methods they used last year like Soucy was excellent with his breakouts last year because he made the easy play.
canucks,lxtoucx,2024-11-18 16:41:30,I may just be a certified hater which I am but I'd be scratching Myers ahead of him. Last night was an absolute disaster class he's starting to fall into his old habits of just staying stationary in front of his own goalie and not doing much. He's not confident on the puck and every clearing attempt either has to be saved by a forward or ends up iced.I'm genuinely curious if one of them is dragging the other down and I think once Forbort is back (purely for his alleged PK ability) one of them needs to sit and Myers should sit first.Not to be 100% negative either Myers has responded extremely well in the past after being healthy scratched.
canucks,lxtvmxq,2024-11-18 17:16:32,Scratch him and replace him with who?Our defence is simply not built well. The problem is not which of our personnel should be used - the problem is that it is basically just Hughes/Hronek and then whatever scraps we've been able to find while management focuses on our forwards. Brannstrom is adequate too but he's not an actual game-changer.
canucks,lxu2v23,2024-11-18 17:55:36,Watch Tocchet stick with the Soucy Myers pair again for next game that's how stubborn he is. Also Juulsen doesn't belong in the NHL call up Friedman.
canucks,lxtc455,2024-11-18 15:37:29,bench Hronek right along with him
canucks,lxtbasy,2024-11-18 15:33:21,Yup. It’s a mystery best left to Soucy to think about in a cabin in the hills far away from the ice.
canucks,lxuah6i,2024-11-18 18:39:23,Golfed and drank beer all summer instead of working out like the rest of us!
canucks,lxt8s8a,2024-11-18 15:20:32,Yeah something has happened. We can blame coaching or whatever but I see the same thing - player specific stuff with Soucy. He makes weird decisions loses assignments and is just off his game. Anyways eventually he’ll revert to form but until then he needs a timeout in his corner to think about what he’s done.
canucks,lxtcwqz,2024-11-18 15:41:30,Fair but I’m not talking about team results or even 2nd pair results - just Soucy. He’s actively hurting the team right now. He’s not the only problem but he might be the biggest right now.
canucks,lxtsw1a,2024-11-18 17:02:03,There were so many good D Options in free agency and we went for none of them
canucks,lxtv4de,2024-11-18 17:13:48,I mean thinking Forbort Desharnais would be a successful third pair worth $3.5M seems an equally far reach. I had slightly more confidence in the Myers Soucy pair and even with their dismal showing they've been outdone by Forbort and Vinny.
canucks,lxu6ev3,2024-11-18 18:15:48,Yeah the “make the first easy pass quickly” philosophy is how they got Gudbranson to look passably ok in Calgary. It kind of worked.
canucks,lxtvp2r,2024-11-18 17:16:52,Certified hater boy / certified giraffe destroyYeah I mean it’s kind of a target rich environment on defence. Like which one of these pieces of crap smells the worst? Well…Sure. Bench Myers… or Soucy. Or both. Do something.
canucks,lxu666l,2024-11-18 18:14:25,Yeah Juulsen probably needs a new home. Friedmann was actually sneaky good with Cole last year. Worth a shot.
canucks,lxtd915,2024-11-18 15:43:12,He didn’t look great last night but I’d disagree with that prescription doc.
canucks,lxtiz82,2024-11-18 16:11:56,Bench him and do what though?Desharnais and Juulson are RHD and are no better or worse. Branstrom likes to play right side as far as I believe and he's not going to do well playing a matchup role against top opposition. Forbort is injured and kinda stinks as well anyway. Soucy is the best option regardless of how bad he is. Right. Now we desperately need at least one top 4 D and preferably 2 so we can have Myers and Soucy playing bottom pair roles and minutes like they should be
canucks,lxu1utx,2024-11-18 17:50:03,Because all of them knew where they were going to sign well before FA.The real braindead move was panicking and signing Desharnais when we could've had our picking of Liljegren or Fabbro had we just waited. Acquiring one of them wouldn't have been an isolated move either just like now we would be accruing space and could go for someone else at the deadline.Say what you want about either of them but a M. Pettersson/DF or TL is an NHL caliber 2nd pair.Soucy - Myers is clearly not. Neither of them would sniff 18+ minutes on a contending team.
canucks,lxtdnh2,2024-11-18 15:45:13,Dude needs to shoot the puck and stop thinking he is just on the ice to defer to Hughes. He is also a -7 on the year according to the graphic
canucks,lxtkegr,2024-11-18 16:19:02,See the second part of the post. Brannstrom has probably earned a shot at more minutes. He’s doing ok in his role so give him some more opportunities. He can’t be any worse and could be a lot better.Yes look a trade but in the meantime use what you have and allocate TOI accordingly.
canucks,lxte7ea,2024-11-18 15:48:01,I believe that is net penalties not +/-. He’s currently a +8 according to Hockey Reference.
canucks,lxu57to,2024-11-18 18:08:55,Brannstrom has been playing adequately for his role defensively in sheltered minutes and doing amazing offensively. Let's not ruin his confidence by throwing him to the wolves pairing him with Myers against top opposition.
canucks,lxtszad,2024-11-18 17:02:32,Well I guess I’ll eat my hat then! Though just watching him game in and game out he doesn’t seem to be clicking
canucks,lxu89gm,2024-11-18 18:26:31,I disagree … Brannstrom’s not a rookie to the league. He played like 5-6 seasons with Ottawa. Has played over 250 nhl games. Rough patches in his career but he’s coming in prime years most esp. for defenseman. Toss em in with Myers and let’s see. It couldn’t be worst than Souc rn. Let Souc get some confidence in d3 pairing role.
canucks,lxtv4vx,2024-11-18 17:13:52,Yep agree!
canucks,lxt2i3l,2024-11-18 14:48:26,Jeannot's suspension needed to be longer. The league can be such a joke sometimes.
canucks,lxt2mm0,2024-11-18 14:49:04,Good - I’m glad we’re taking our time with proper rehab. Whiplash is better than a concussion and as much as I’d love to have Boeser back we have the depth now to give him the time he needs.
canucks,lxt36gq,2024-11-18 14:51:50,I've been there with a similar concussion whiplash combo injury. Definitely nothing to rush because of how compounding the effects are even if the concussion is relatively low grade.
canucks,lxt7y3v,2024-11-18 15:16:13,Honestly between the NHLPA protecting players and the NHL refusing to acknowledge the severity headshots in the league is an absolute joke.  Jeannot sits for maybe a week at the most meanwhile Boeser literally may never have the same livelihood.  Concussions are no joke and now Boeser is a lot more susceptible to have another one.
canucks,lxt4kfg,2024-11-18 14:58:51,Fuck Jeannot
canucks,lxt4l6p,2024-11-18 14:58:58,we’re missing boeser greatly but on the flip side i’m glad he’s taking his time to fully recover
canucks,lxt3ccc,2024-11-18 14:52:40,I thought someone got a quote from mark friedman our defenseman talking about the guys lol
canucks,lxt61xm,2024-11-18 15:06:27,"This is bullshit.The amount of times I have heard players (youth hockey) get a similar ""diagnosis"" after taking a head shot and obviously having a concussion - only to go to a chiro and being told it's in the neck more of a whiplash.I may (and probably am) speaking out of turn here. But this shit really pisses me off.It's a headshot sure their was most definitely some soft tissue damage to the neck area.  But we need to get away from this ""more of a whiplash thing"" that gets pushed from a certain alternative healthcare provider(s).I feel like its a way to take the attention away from the brain injury itself."
canucks,lxt2y3b,2024-11-18 14:50:41,Fuck Tanner
canucks,lxtq1it,2024-11-18 16:47:35,Fuck fines and suspentions I think they should take away teams points. 3 games = 6pts.
canucks,lxt7si6,2024-11-18 15:15:25,Poolman was also reportedly a whiplash type injury... Scary stuff
canucks,lxttwoy,2024-11-18 17:07:22,Purely from a sporting fairness perspective. If an egregious hit takes out a player the offending player should be suspended until return. The offending team should not be able to fulfill that player's spot on the roster. Boesser's loss has a measurable impact on our point standing.
canucks,lxtbwxf,2024-11-18 15:36:28,Good.  Let them heal.  Last night's disappointment behind us positioned just fine in the standings at this point.  Poised to surge if we get two of our better players back when they're ready.
canucks,lxtx9q0,2024-11-18 17:25:20,Sorry all this one is my fault. Last time I came to watch the Canucks Petey got concussed. I'll be there again in a few weeks and now Brock is out. Please bubble wrap Huggy.
canucks,lxu2d0j,2024-11-18 17:52:49,Apologies for my ignorance - but does whiplash mean he doesn’t have a concussion or can both happen at the same time?
canucks,lxt4h3w,2024-11-18 14:58:24,Thank god it's whiplash! It could've been far worse.
canucks,lxt3t1u,2024-11-18 14:55:01,They're really dropping the ball with these suspensions. Both the Jeannot hit and the Reaves one deserved 6-10 games. Jeannot due to the premeditated/intentional nature of the hit and Reaves due to his history.
canucks,lxtai2y,2024-11-18 15:29:16,Suspend the player for = time out of the injured player in this way no one in the league will cause these injuries anymore
canucks,lxtev4y,2024-11-18 15:51:16,At least this gives the Canucks an extended look at Lekkeramaki.
canucks,lxtr5gw,2024-11-18 16:53:11,Is whiplash better than concussion? Look at poolman who’s dealing with both concussion and whiplash symptoms.
canucks,lxu0pb6,2024-11-18 17:43:45,How long did it take you to get back to regular activities and scoring goals?
canucks,lxtew53,2024-11-18 15:51:25,I put this more on the NHLPA than the league. They need to be the ones to push to protect their members against brain damage. The league just has to make sure the balance the players choose is acceptable to fans and owners. If the players don't want to crack down on this then why should anyone else drive the bus on that issue.
canucks,lxt9v28,2024-11-18 15:26:01,At best I would say maybe he has whiplash AND a concussion but I find it very hard to believe he didnt have a concussion
canucks,lxt7ybp,2024-11-18 15:16:15,I understand how you feel. There’s a certain undertone that kinda seems like they just don’t want to use the C word. Very slimey.
canucks,lxtclzm,2024-11-18 15:39:59,I’ve had a couple physiotherapists I’ve seen who say pretty emphatically that whiplash means you’ve got a concussion. The force required to get whiplash in your neck usually means a concussion is simultaneous. It might be “minor” (and those physios hate saying minor concussion because people don’t treat it as seriously) compared to a full on blow to the head but I’d prefer they treat _any_ whiplash/head hits as concussions and let qualified medical staff take as many precautions as needed.I’m totally with you that we need to get away from saying “it’s _only_ whiplash” and start treating whiplash as a simultaneous symptom of a possible concussion. Also even if it is “only” whiplash that’s a soft tissue injury on your neck. That’s an important spot! Take care of it heal up first.
canucks,lxt5a99,2024-11-18 15:02:29,that Reeves hit was brutal. Why is he even in the league
canucks,lxtymyr,2024-11-18 17:32:39,Reaves at least showed concern and was visibly shaken by what did. Jeannottindahead was smirking the thief who got caught. League has shot themselves in the foot here. Kinda handcuffed. 3 for reaves and 6 for jeannotindahead would seem more fair.
canucks,lxtcsgq,2024-11-18 15:40:54,this would work if this only applies to players who’s intent was to injure in the first place
canucks,lxtx1ug,2024-11-18 17:24:09,"You do that and every time McDavid so much as brushes a player at the wrong time they're going to be suddenly injured. Also how you going to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt intent vs any number of excuses like ""I was aiming for the shoulder but they didn't go the way I thought they were going to go"". I understand the sentiment. It would only make things worse. Increasing the baseline suspension for headshots and similar plays would be adequate."
canucks,lxtzfdx,2024-11-18 17:36:55,A combination of both is definitely worse than just a concussion. Stiffness of the neck impedes blood flow to the head which makes it more difficult to recover from TBI. However if it's whiplash with minimal or no brain trauma (which I pray is the case) then that is definitely preferable to a concussion.
canucks,lxtae6c,2024-11-18 15:28:44,And that is the whole mechanism behind the concussion.  ITs a violent hit that makes the head move in a manner that the brain gets 'bruised.'So yeah i am in agreement(to a point).  To me thought head > neck soft tissue damage. It just feels like a deflection.
canucks,lxt9eo4,2024-11-18 15:23:41,I feel pretty strongly about this topic as my own son who was a pretty decent younger hockey player went through concussion issues right when full contact was introduced.  He in fact a concussion issues for months. I took on safety and coaching roles and i took those positions fairly seriously.  The amount of times i saw parents use the above diagnosis to get their kids on the ice was way too high.To be clear i heard parents of high performing hockey players say the same thing on the same sports centric chiro clinics in and around Vancouver.It was almost like a default response to the injury.
canucks,lxtbf11,2024-11-18 15:33:56,They were both bad.  The Jeannot one was worse imo because it wasn't even part of the play.  Might as well sucker punch a guy at that point.  Atleast Reaves was going for the hit and went up high so it was still part of a legit hockey play.
canucks,lxtfgaf,2024-11-18 15:54:11,Brock’s incident was intended for sure
canucks,lxtcbvt,2024-11-18 15:38:35,One of the things I havent liked about this coach/management group is how they downplay injuries. They got pissy when Petey told us about his injuries after the playoffs last year. Apparently they wanted people to lie like Hronek clearly did?
canucks,lxtcnud,2024-11-18 15:40:16,I agree.Reeves hit was atrociously bad but at least Nurse had the puck and was eligible to be hit in terms of possession (whether he was due to distance from boards I think depends on hit strength).Boeser shouldn't have been hit at all.
canucks,lxtq2bf,2024-11-18 16:47:41,yeah i’m all for jeannot sitting for as long as boeser that was clearly intentional even worse than reaves’s hit
canucks,lxtfpb1,2024-11-18 15:55:27,"I liked how they tried to push the narrative that demkos new knee injury was a new and unrelated injury to his other knee injury and not that he was rushed back too early. As if anyone over the age of 30 doesn't know how that goes.           And it's not their fault that Mikheyev wanted to play through a torn achilles. And that Miller last night isn't a health issue he just ""wasn't one of the guys that were going to get them back into the game""."
canucks,lxt0avi,2024-11-18 14:37:18,THATCHER TAKE MY LEG MUSCLES \o/
canucks,lxt3x08,2024-11-18 14:55:34,Just duct tape the knee and get him in there. Miller also needs some duct tape and popsicle sticks around the wrist. Boeser? Duct tape headband. I'm available for medical staff duties.
canucks,lxt21kx,2024-11-18 14:46:06,At this point I’ll believe when he’s on the ice
canucks,lxt0ccc,2024-11-18 14:37:30,Really hope he's not rushing back to try and make Team USA.
canucks,lxt1a1i,2024-11-18 14:42:15,Like my lottomax win is imminent. 
canucks,lxtc5r6,2024-11-18 15:37:42,I'm not looking forward to wincing every time I see Demko make an acrobatic save for pretty much the remainder of his career
canucks,lxt0kzm,2024-11-18 14:38:43,He’s been “imminent” forever remember how he was “gonna be back for the stars”?I’ll believe it when I see him
canucks,lxtgbg8,2024-11-18 15:58:32,Just remember folks not to overreact if he's not immediately in All-Star form.Everyone was so over-hyped about Joshua returning as if we're getting a banging 20 goal scorer infusion. Which we are! Eventually.But so far 3 games 12 mins TOI -3.I'm not criticizing. He'll need time.So will Demko.
canucks,lxt6jpe,2024-11-18 15:08:59,When he’s actually between the pipes in regular practice with regularity Ill start to believe it. Even though I wont be confident hes back until hes actually in net for a game.
canucks,lxt0kll,2024-11-18 14:38:40,Alright Dhaliwal  now give us the real timeframe
canucks,lxt1mvg,2024-11-18 14:44:02,I'm fucking pumped for Demmer to be back but god I hope he doesn't rush it. Last thing we need is him injuring himself again. Whenever he is back though it's going to hit like we just got a massive trade. Team will hopefully look unrecognizable!
canucks,lxt4yzy,2024-11-18 15:00:52,I’ll believe it when I see it. Fully expect him not to play til next year but I’d love to be wrong on this.
canucks,lxt4468,2024-11-18 14:56:35,When I see him playing in a game I'll chill.
canucks,lxt6pw0,2024-11-18 15:09:51,I’m going to tomorrow’s game. Is that imminent enough?
canucks,lxtgvuv,2024-11-18 16:01:22,I saw him on Friday at practice and he looked to be fully participating in practice with no problems I think there’s a chance he comes back beginning of December sometime maybe maybe end of November
canucks,lxtnkm5,2024-11-18 16:35:05,First game back he is going to pull his cockix. Watch.
canucks,lxt9vtr,2024-11-18 15:26:08,I just how when he comes back Marko Torenius won't be as physically demanding as Clark.
canucks,lxt9x5h,2024-11-18 15:26:18,Won’t believe til I see him in game lol
canucks,lxtaiff,2024-11-18 15:29:19,I'm excited if he is truly ready and they are not rushing him.  This team plays differently (read: better) when he is in net.
canucks,lxtcmjd,2024-11-18 15:40:04,Here's hoping he's back and healthy.
canucks,lxt1vrb,2024-11-18 14:45:17,When was the last time Dreger was a reliable source of information on Vancouver? He hasn't been reliable for info since his cousin left the market.We know Demko has been participating in practices. This really just seems like Dreger seeing the news that Demko has had a few full practices and coming to the conclusion he is close vs Dreger receiving info that nobody else is aware of and reporting it.Its been 2 weeks now since it was first reported Demko was on the ice [before a Canucks practice](https://theprovince.com/sports/hockey/nhl/vancouver-canucks/canucks-thatcher-demko-spotted-on-ice) and it's been about a week since it was reported he took part in a [full practice](https://youtu.be/_uBmKiG6CNM?si=AH0HVdBW_7N-XJuw).
canucks,lxt9832,2024-11-18 15:22:44,Bro just tell me he’s playing next game or not so tired of these indistinct timelines 
canucks,lxtldln,2024-11-18 16:23:56,I'm wondering how long he'll last when he does return. The recovery from this injury is a mystery.
canucks,lxtnbk0,2024-11-18 16:33:48,If it lasts longer than 4 hours seek medical attention
canucks,lxtnoyw,2024-11-18 16:35:42,I’ll believe it when I see it.
canucks,lxtsgi2,2024-11-18 16:59:48,[the percolations are imminent](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/6900bb9f-b3ba-4192-9ed4-4044269a4159)

canucks,lxt0xlu,2024-11-18 14:40:30,I was actually hoping he wouldn’t get chosen because USA has Hellebyuck Oettinger and Swayman and with Demko haven’t played since April they should go with those 3. However with Swayman’s bad play recently they might pick Demko instead based on his potential. Plus Hellebyuck would be the starter anyways so the other 2 goalies is just there for back-up and insurance.

canucks,lxsz7zx,2024-11-18 14:31:49,Hoglander and a 2nd maybe another late pick
canucks,lxti5qg,2024-11-18 16:07:48,Dmen traded last year:- Edmundson for a 3rd and 5th- Zadorov for a 3rd and 5th- Walker for a conditional 1st and Ryan Johansen (capdump)- Lybushkin for a 3rd and 6th- Tanev for a 2nd and 4th and C level prospect- Hanifin for a 1st and 3rd and MiromanovLooking at all of those deals Petterson probably ends up somewhere around the Tanev value. More value than Zadorov/Edmundson but less than Hanifin.
canucks,lxtaqyj,2024-11-18 15:30:32,This is the easiest trade ever!  It's simple mathematics.  Rule of Equivalence!  One Pettersson equals exactly one Pettersson.  Always and forever.  Etched in stone.
canucks,lxt1c4i,2024-11-18 14:42:32,Pens fan here. Expectation would be something similar to the Guentzel trade (Bunting a conditional first turned into a second and 3 B-ish tier prospects). However Dubas keeps saying he wants players back so maybe something around Hoglander works.
canucks,lxt8e9v,2024-11-18 15:18:32,Gotta give value to get value and right now our bottom 6 isn't nearly as bad as our 3/4D.I rather have Bains/Aman/PDG on the 4th line than Soucy or Myers consistently playing mid-pairing because *that* isn't working.
canucks,lxt8dwf,2024-11-18 15:18:29,I’ve loved Hog for a while think he has so much potential and is good at many things but if we can trade Hog for Pettersson without attaching too much more I think the team need is for M. Pettersson big time. Hoglander is likely going to be a chippy 15-20 goal scored and top 9 winger for his career and would fit well in Pittsburgh. I do wonder if Pittsburgh would take that deal tho it does seem to match their ask but they might be able to get a better package from another team
canucks,lxt38fk,2024-11-18 14:52:07,We have plenty of capable 4th line wingers in our system. PDG Karlsson Aman are all reliable even if they don’t bring the same offence as Hoggy. Bains looks fine in a 4th line role. We can easily upgrade on them at the deadline for cheap too.
canucks,lxthrvy,2024-11-18 16:05:52,I love Hoglander but our forward depth is really strong and defensive depth really weak. We can trade for a bottom 6 player easily. Heck we might be able to get a pick back in addition to Pettersson for Hoglander and then flip that for a bottom 6 player.
canucks,lxtttei,2024-11-18 17:06:53,So kind of you to use such mild words...

canucks,lxtkao2,2024-11-18 16:18:30,Thats an insane overpay for a rental.
canucks,lxt0w8f,2024-11-18 14:40:18,If the Penguins are clearing house of everyone not named Crosby Malkin and Letang it would be really silly of them to retain on Pettersson as they only have a single retention slot for the season.Dubas would be better off taking salary back to keep his one retention slot open. There are other players on multi year deals that they can move that are better suited for retaining salary.
canucks,lxt1pje,2024-11-18 14:44:25,Hoglander and a 2nd is probably high unless the bidding war gets insane or management tries frontrunning the market.I’d point it at closer to Hoglander and a conditional 3rd/4th based on what we saw last year
canucks,lxt33rm,2024-11-18 14:51:27,Seems slightly high and at that point might check the price for Andersson.That said Pettersson is 6'5 so he'd fit right in with our gigantic blueline.
canucks,lxt2r03,2024-11-18 14:49:41,Don't think they would want him. What would he bring
canucks,lxt2no9,2024-11-18 14:49:13,I know people love to overhype their players (we do it too) but I think it’s obvious to say that Pettersson and Guentzel are two entirely different tiers of players who get way different returns. I feel it would come in between the Tanev and Hanifin returns in reality.
canucks,lxt2n9n,2024-11-18 14:49:10,Curious - Pettersson doesn’t seem to me to have near the value of Guentzel. Position would boost things for sure but Guentzel was clearly the top available piece at the TDL I kind of doubt Pettersson would be?
canucks,lxta8ni,2024-11-18 15:27:56,We only gave up a fifth and a third for Zadorov last year
canucks,lxt3luh,2024-11-18 14:54:01,I’d take Hög over those 4 guys every single day of the week twice on Sunday. Hog and Garland are our best pick retrieval and do their best work in tight on the wall. That will not be replaced by any of those guys

canucks,lxtuwl5,2024-11-18 17:12:39,Going to need a properly cited source preferably someone with a PHD at minimum.
canucks,lxtsp9j,2024-11-18 17:01:05,I didn't really know about Penguins cap situation. I guess the Canucks could throw in someone marginal to make the cap work? I think we might be pretty close to begin with as Hogs salary is 3 million and Pettersons is 4 025 175. The age of the players makes sense for both teams IMO but I have no idea what other offers Pitts would be looking at from other teams.
canucks,lxto50y,2024-11-18 16:37:56,Could get a third party like Columbus to retain.  Give that third to Columbus for 50% retained (not sure if that % is possible).
canucks,lxtg0jr,2024-11-18 15:57:01,I think Hoglander 1 for 1 is the highest I'd go. Hoglander is a 20 goal scorer and he's still young while Pettersson is a rental. Hoglander could easily end up being a solid top 6 forward and he's signed for 3M for 3 years after this season.
canucks,lxtixj3,2024-11-18 16:11:42,I don't see any bidding wars getting too outrageous. I'm sure lots of teams like Pettersson but doubt anyone is so enamoured that they'll make a big play. Right now teams are probably starting with a Zadorov/Edmundson type package (3rd + 5th). From there I don't see the value getting higher than something like a 2nd + 4th. So with that if you're using Hoglander in the deal something like Hog's and a 4th probably beats out other offers.
canucks,lxte39x,2024-11-18 15:47:26,It all depends how much value Hoglander actually has. The potential vs reality argument for him has some meat on both sides but every year the reality side gets a bit beefed up.The other thing that could jack the price is how few qualitry options exist on nonplaoyff teams. It's like Pettersson and then you're almost immediately into a pretty rough list that's headlined by like Ceci Provorov and Martinez.
canucks,lxtyl5t,2024-11-18 17:32:23,Pettersson is such a weird player in terms of his attributes. He’s listed at 6’5 which is 22nd tallest in the league but is listed as the 15th lightest player in the entire league. Like he’s 7 inches taller Zach Benson (19) but only 4 lbs heavier.His build makes no sense to me.
canucks,lxt4m7z,2024-11-18 14:59:06,Hoggy would arguably be their best LW right now. They have *Beauvillier* playing on the first line with Crosby currently. He would add speed youth and scoring ability all things they’re desperate for. He’s cost controlled so they can keep him around for these next couple years and then probably flip him for a haul after Crosby pumps up his numbers. He fits what Dubas wants for roster players
canucks,lxt3c7t,2024-11-18 14:52:39,Hoglander scored 20 last year and is 24. I think him and a second is worth more than the aforementioned package which was my point Pens would expect something closer to a bunch of magic beans and a middle six player vs a second and legitimate top sixer in our lineup that’s only 24 years old.
canucks,lxthvqn,2024-11-18 16:06:26,Pettersson is way better than Zadorov.
canucks,lxtbzhv,2024-11-18 15:36:49,The thing is I'd rather have a better second defender than a better fourth line winger.
canucks,lxt483w,2024-11-18 14:57:09,that’s true but at the same time look at our thin ass blue line. we’re overplaying quinn as a result because we have four bottom pair defensemen
canucks,lxu3msn,2024-11-18 17:59:54,Raymond Ballard and a first
canucks,lxtuu62,2024-11-18 17:12:18,It is :)
canucks,lxtwqoj,2024-11-18 17:22:29,From my armchair GM standpoint I’d do Hoglander for Petersson but I would also want something coming back to Vancouver. Hoglander + 2nd for Petersson + Two 3rd round picks. Hoglanders a young player with term. And Petersson is a rental. I feel like you need to get some draft capital back or bring in a prospect.
canucks,lxtxfh9,2024-11-18 17:26:10,I think with Pittsburgh being more re-tool than rebuild a piece like Hoglander could be pretty intriguing. Compared to like a 2nd round pick or something. It’s far from a guarantee but *if* Hoglander is a piece that can fit in on a line with Crosby/Malkin that’s a big get for Pittsburgh.
canucks,lxt8tvn,2024-11-18 15:20:46,damn having crosby on your team really is just an infinite money hack

canucks,lxth9z9,2024-11-18 16:03:21,I think Hoglander and a second is overpaying. Honestly I'd say Hoglander for Pettersson and a third.
canucks,lxtchsl,2024-11-18 15:39:24,I’d rather trade picks if we had to. And if we keep playing this way we aren’t even getting out of the first round so really we should just keep whatever draft capital we have. Bit too early to tell
canucks,lxt84av,2024-11-18 15:17:07,We got Zad for a fifth and a third last year.
canucks,lxu0a5h,2024-11-18 17:41:28,Honestly right now I don't think I'd be willing to include Hoglander. He's a valuable piece to potentially include in a bigger deal later on. I'd probably be holding steady on a similar value to the Zadorov trade at the moment (3rd + 5th). Maybe instead of the 5th you're willing to do a prospect like Krudyatsev or Mynio. Probably doesn't get it done right now but I don't think other teams will be offering more at the moment either. I want to keep the Hoglander piece in the chamber at the moment.
canucks,lxtgup1,2024-11-18 16:01:12,We're burning through futures like crazy under both old and new Jim. We already don't have a ton of great prospects. If Lekkerimaki and Raty are with the big club we have literally one other prospect of note in Willander and nothing else of trade value. We also already cleared out two third round picks and a second.
canucks,lxtbhfk,2024-11-18 15:34:17,Doesn’t mean the same will be out there this year.
canucks,lxu1r7k,2024-11-18 17:49:29,That’s totally fair. I’d be reluctant to give up Hoglander but if Pettersson is a guy that can hold his own on the 2nd pair I’d be for it. I should also say I’d make the deal conditional on your being able to speak to Peterssons camp and get a sense of his interest in playing in Van/extending. An extended Petersson for Hoglander (and then you try to backfill Hoggys spot with an Abby player).
canucks,lxth260,2024-11-18 16:02:15,Well apparently we have four “capable 4th line wingers” so trade a couple of them not hoggy
canucks,lxtc0w1,2024-11-18 15:37:01,Well I don’t think Marcus petterson steps in and saves the whole teams problems. Way overpaying isn’t the right move either imo. The way we look right now the Cup isn’t looking possible so why give up players and picks if we aren’t even guaranteed our playoff spot
canucks,lxu3o2v,2024-11-18 18:00:06,Ya I'm not against moving Hoglander for Pettersson. I just don't think there's a rush to do so right now. We've got a 9-5-3 record good for 3rd in the division with games in hand on most teams. We all know the defence needs to be upgraded but as difficult as it is to watch sometimes we have the ability to be patient. I'd be playing some cat and mouse right now with the penguins. They don't need to move Pettersson right now either they can wait until the deadline. I'd bank on nobody else giving them an enticing enough offer to move Pettersson now. Come January when there is a clearer picture of who else is available you can then move towards adding Hoglander into a Pettersson deal if you think that is a primary target still. I agree an extension around his current AAV of 4mil would be an important factor.
canucks,lxti04w,2024-11-18 16:07:02,Capable fourth line wingers usually don't have much value.
canucks,lxti2ys,2024-11-18 16:07:26,We're literally second in the division with $10M worth of injuries all season long. The cup absolutely is possible.
canucks,lxu8t4p,2024-11-18 18:29:41,Patience is a virtue for sure. It’s not like theres a bunch of injuries derailing the season. It’s also a case where I *like* M. Pettersson.. but I don’t *love* him. He’s just sort of the only girl at the bar at the moment which is why his name comes up so much. Best case ontario is they stay patient some player/agent starts looking for a trade and the Canucks are able to pounce on it (like Zadorov).
canucks,lxti8nk,2024-11-18 16:08:13,The argument on this entire thread is about Höglander being a capable fourth line winger …
canucks,lxtiijh,2024-11-18 16:09:36,We are third in the division??? lmao and tied with CGY and only 1 point ahead of the oilers who are 1000% getting in the playoffs so
canucks,lxtit1g,2024-11-18 16:11:04,He's more than a capable fourth line winger which is why you want to keep him and why other teams would value him.
canucks,lxtiv1e,2024-11-18 16:11:21,I'm talking points% the only thing that matters this early on.
canucks,lxsucq4,2024-11-18 14:07:28,Most hockey injuries arent black and white. It’s not like a broken wrist where there are clear timelines and obvious signs of when somebody is healed. A lot of injuries aren’t visible and are diagnosed by player feedback.Petey’s tendinitis is the perfect example. All the coaching staff can do is trust the players word. If he says he’s good to play what can Tocchet do? Overrule him and say I don’t believe you? It’s likely the same with whatever’s bothering Miller the guy is a warrior and isn’t gonna try to sit out unless he physically can’t play or is forced to sit.There comes a point where the coach is forced to ruffle some feathers and force the player to sit but it’s tough when you’re dealing with a superstar who is a big part of your teams leadership group. The coach often needs to defer to their opinions.
canucks,lxsxesv,2024-11-18 14:22:45,if everyone with even a bruise weren't to play games half the league would just be AHL callups
canucks,lxsvvt6,2024-11-18 14:15:07,Are you basing this on any experience or education? Not that I don't agree or believe. I'm just looking for something beyond speculation.This is how pro sports organizations handle injuries of their most valuable players? They don't dig deeper and insist on things being properly diagnosed documented and managed?
canucks,lxt02r7,2024-11-18 14:36:09,I’m basing it off my personal experience. Obviously not at the NHL level with the resources they have but it’s still the same gist. So much of sport injury diagnosis is based off player testimony and if a player downplays how much they’re hurting then what is the medical staff supposed to do?
canucks,lxtjwd9,2024-11-18 16:16:31,Yes I'm 100% sure a professional sports team doesn't have an in-depth understanding of their own player's injuries. /sHonestly not really sure what you're looking for here. You want the team to publicly share the players' medicals?
canucks,lxtbgxf,2024-11-18 15:34:13,"Most players have "" injuries "" they play through also probably not the best idea to let the other team know what they are."
canucks,lxsmaau,2024-11-18 13:27:06,We need any top 4 D. Both Soucy and Myers aren't cutting it. So getting an RHD would be a bonus really.
canucks,lxsz3g1,2024-11-18 14:31:12,Don’t think we need a righty specifically we just need a guy that can play a stable 20 minutes PK and make a good first passHonestly a bit of a tall order
canucks,lxsw56c,2024-11-18 14:16:24,\*whispering* the real target should be a legit #2 LD Myers and Hronek are locked in; they might as well make the left side a position of strength since the right is a position of mid.
canucks,lxtjfqt,2024-11-18 16:14:12,So the Leafs have two Top 4 RHD (Tanev OEL) that were discarded by the Canucks.  They play a combined 40 minutes a night.  Next season they will pay $8 million for these two players and we'll be paying $4.8 million on our cap to NOT have one.  Not a good look for the Canucks front office.
canucks,lxsk7et,2024-11-18 13:16:41,RHD depth is virtually non-existent for the Canucks currently. Allvin & Rutherford are going to be pretty hard pressed to find a regular NHLer in FA or trade market. They will probably have to explore non-traditional markets; like college ranks or lesser euro or KHL leagues to find that diamond in a rough but that's a crap shoot. I think they would be more successful if they could find a left handed D-Man who can play on the right.
canucks,lxsmpr7,2024-11-18 13:29:13,I'm a righty put me in coach!
canucks,lxt2vg5,2024-11-18 14:50:18,Another name that I wonder about probably a long shot is Mackenzie Weegar. He's a bit older and has 6 more years on his contract but his ability to play right or left side equally effectively would be huge. In theory he could pair with any of Hughes Hronek Myers Soucy. And then when Willander and DPetey make the jump he would be an option with either of them as well. He's a legit top 3 dman with tons of versatility.
canucks,lxthmce,2024-11-18 16:05:06,Isn't every NHL team looking for a Top4 dman?  I'm sure we'll make a trade for one but he'll be a 4/5 at best but depth never hurts.
canucks,lxstvll,2024-11-18 14:05:05,Meyers isnt even the problem its Soucy. like it or not he's a fine #4 D because he is right handed. I think the solution is Branstrom Meyers and add just move soucy down to the third pair.Branstrom is playing like a top 4 D.
canucks,lxt9t27,2024-11-18 15:25:45,The best thing that could happen to us is Willander being ready to make the jump when BU's season is over
canucks,lxtzn7n,2024-11-18 17:38:04,I disagree with your initial premise that it needs to be a RHD. Not only does a RH player cost more to acquire but the goal should be for Willander to step into a top 4 role within the next couple of years. I think the real concern long term is a LHD to player ‘under’ Hughes
canucks,lxu8scm,2024-11-18 18:29:33,Every team needs a top four RHD it's the most coveted position but that's also why the market is thin and the price is high. You gotta draft them basically.
canucks,lxt030q,2024-11-18 14:36:12,IMO market is so thin on RHD it’s not worth it to overpay for a righty when either handedness would do right now not to mention we’re thinner on the left somehow Brannstrom Hronek Myers Vinny Juulsen and Friedman can all play the right side. On the left there’s Hughes Soucy Forbort and Brannstrom. If any more of our LHD’s goes down we’re looking at playing someone on their off side or digging into the AHL roster. To me it makes more sense to pursue a LHD given the presumably lower cost and positional need
canucks,lxt2j04,2024-11-18 14:48:33,I just think that a righty fits our needs better. It increases our floor by pushing Vinny or Juulsen out rather than Brandstrom or Forbort. It also increases our ceiling because if you score an excellent LHD they’re capped on the second pair. If the new D fits like a glove with Hughes then you can push Hronek to the second pair and he drives his own pair. The RHD acquisition increases our floor more than a LHD and has the potential to increase our ceiling. So yeah we may not need a RHD but I think it’s the logical option.
canucks,lxt78zc,2024-11-18 15:12:36,Yah we only have the norris winner from last year as our #1 LD should probably improve on that position... we need a solid #3 defenseman of either handedness
canucks,lxu0eu2,2024-11-18 17:42:10,OEL is a LHD.
canucks,lxu91ow,2024-11-18 18:31:03,Unpopular opinion maybe but they should’ve waited out on OEL at least another season or 2 before deciding to buy him out.
canucks,lxsn8g4,2024-11-18 13:31:51,I heard Pettersson can play right.
canucks,lxt7pfl,2024-11-18 15:14:58,I don't think it works with the contract he has. We are gonna have to re-sign hughes to about double his current cap hit boeser and hopefully demko are both gonna need a new contract as well. I don't think we can lock in 6mil for 6 years
canucks,lxt0qeg,2024-11-18 14:39:29,>Brannstrom is playing like a top 4 D. He’s averaging about 15 minutes. He’s looked good but in a reduced role against presumably easier competition. That’s third pairing deployment if we’re being honest
canucks,lxsvasg,2024-11-18 14:12:12,Can Hronek and Brannstrom handle being a pairing putting Hughes with Soucy Myers or Forbort (when he returns)?
canucks,lxtrfch,2024-11-18 16:54:34,Opportunity cost says the odds that Willander fills in for us are better than Forbort filling in for us.
canucks,lxt4grw,2024-11-18 14:58:21,True but my thought process is the skill difference between Forbort and Vinny/Brannstrom isn’t large enough to warrant the price difference between an equal calibre LHD and RHD. Idea of having Hronek carrying his own pairing is a good one but the market price of that 2RD is like a 1st hogs and something else. I was thinking of someone more akin to Zadorov pursuing a #4/5 LHD for a second rounder or a third+. I think if we stabilize the bottom pair and equalize the deployment between the bottom 4 Soucy and Myers will look better as a result. That requires a legit 20 minute defender who can PK and play against the best though.
canucks,lxt8509,2024-11-18 15:17:13,"OOPS that should've said #2! Their second LD on the lineup by minutes is a guy whose pulling a ""scratch Soucy"" thread every 24 hours. Their third LD on the lineup by minutes was a contract throw in whose crushing his minutes but for some reason can't out-earn Soucy by TOI.They need an actual 2nd pair LD who the coach can use come playoff time because his deployment says Branntstrom isn't it and the results say Soucy isn't it."
canucks,lxsnr84,2024-11-18 13:34:28,Yeah he's good and he'll be good but he's not NHL ready yet. Let him cook a full season in Abbotsford. A rental/place-holder until he is ready would be a better move.
canucks,lxtdv3n,2024-11-18 15:46:17,There would definitely be a risk to it and might have to make some hard decisions but I think it would be doable cap wise. If we sign Boeser to say 8mil extension and move out Desharnais and Hoglander (or equivalent cap of 5mil) we would have a 21 man roster (with Weegar) that still has roughly 2mil in space. Demko's long term future is pretty up in the air but you also have Garland Soucy Heinen expiring after next year. Obviously you'd need to replace some guys but there's enough flexibility there to shuffle the deck. The key would be having Willander step in on an ELC as well as having Lekkerimaki on an ELC for 2 more years. With that it's pretty manageable for the foreseeable future and after 3 years there will be so much change it's almost futile to project out past that.I dunno. I know it's a long shot but that's the type of bold move I personally would like to see us make on the back end. I want to see someone with at least another year left on their deal coming in. Bringing in another top 3 quality dman really takes this roster over the top for this season and next.
canucks,lxt26y9,2024-11-18 14:46:52,Ya Brannstrom has looked really good but you have to keep in mind his TOI is low and he's seeing sheltered minutes. Most of his zone starts are in the offensive zone. Really like what we've seen from him but the jump to 2nd pairing and ≈19mins a night is a big ask.
canucks,lxsxa2c,2024-11-18 14:22:05,Hughes MeyersBrannstom HronekBut Hronek is really the only right hand D that should be playing big minutes.
canucks,lxsoqys,2024-11-18 13:39:29,I meant the Pens Pettersson not our Pettersson. This is already getting confusing and he isn't even on our team.
canucks,lxsohyl,2024-11-18 13:38:12,Pretty sure they are referring to Marcus Pettersson not D-Petey
canucks,lxt37hn,2024-11-18 14:51:59,For sure. He’s passed the eye test but I think people really discount the difference in deployment between the two pairings. Like you said asking a sheltered third pairing puck mover to play as a minute munching second pairing matchup D is a giant ask.
canucks,lxspb35,2024-11-18 13:42:18,Go with the Spiderman No Way Home strategy. Petey 1 Petey 2 Petey 3. Problem solved hopefully
canucks,lxssmny,2024-11-18 13:58:47,Canucks would have a Pettersson monopoly!
canucks,lxu9qxo,2024-11-18 18:35:09,The competition bureau is going to force us to break them all up.
canucks,lxsk8so,2024-11-18 13:16:53,I think Vancouver will be part of the first block of western teams for the PWHL. That being said they’re probably gonna wait a bit to let their business mature before expanding.
canucks,lxsd5wn,2024-11-18 12:41:23,i hope tickets are somewhat cheap
canucks,lxscx9x,2024-11-18 12:40:11,Cool. Would definitely consider a trip to Rogers to watch this just depends on ticket prices really.
canucks,lxsbu2u,2024-11-18 12:34:46,I hope soI’m also hoping ticket prices will be the same or comparative to what they are in their own cities
canucks,lxslu1j,2024-11-18 13:24:52,Gonna cheer on the victoire if they come to town.That being said I don't think Vancouver will get a team until more western/Midwest cities do. Right now the closest team is Minnesota and that'd just be brutal travel for any team coming to Vancouver as well as the Van Team themselves. I could see us getting one when Alberta gets one along with some coastal teams and other Midwest like Chicago
canucks,lxso4wi,2024-11-18 13:36:23,Not anytime too soon but for the future yes.Vancouver is too far from everything else. They're adding two more teams in a year or two but those are likely to be something like Detroit and Pittsburgh. I think they'll eventually move out west but they'll need to have at least 4 teams out west at once to accommodate travel costs.
canucks,lxsbydc,2024-11-18 12:35:21,I can't find any ticket pricing information so I suspect they'll be expensive.
canucks,lxs9phf,2024-11-18 12:24:05,nah. That's when they bring a NBA preseason game to Van. Is like that's all you get lol
canucks,lxsg7o5,2024-11-18 12:56:31,Oh I am very interested
canucks,lxsv7bt,2024-11-18 14:11:43,Really hoping i can get a ticket for this
canucks,lxtrcod,2024-11-18 16:54:11,I kind of just wish it was like in the premier league where there’s a men’s and women’s Man U etcI’d love a women’s Canucks team
canucks,lxswm0u,2024-11-18 14:18:45,This isn't canucks related
canucks,lxtaarp,2024-11-18 15:28:14,And for the best. Last thing we need is this league needing to fold or rebrand/retool again. Interest is growing but travel adds a lot of expense to a growing league like that.
canucks,lxtm8g1,2024-11-18 16:28:16,I agree
canucks,lxslxiq,2024-11-18 13:25:20,Anyone but Toronto I guess
canucks,lxsog0p,2024-11-18 13:37:56,Most of the PWHL ticket prices have been incredibly reasonable! The league wants to keep the game accessible while they're building interest and expanding the fanbase.

All 90 games will be available on Prime for no extra charge (in French AND English for Montreal games). They also have broadcast partnerships with all the major networks. They're leading the way for accessible viewing.

canucks,lxs9bsb,2024-11-18 12:22:12,He's good on the forecheck has speed goes to the front of the net and is reliable defensively. He's a very good top 6 addition that has shown he can fit with Miller or Petey.Most nights he goes unnoticed and has quietly put up 10 points in 17 games while continuing to be an analytical darling. Despite some claims he's a streaky producer he only has a single 4 game streak where he was pointless at the 1/4 mark of the season. DeBrusk has been pretty consistent for us this season in all aspects of the game outside of goalscoring DeBrusk is absolutely a streaky goal scorer.If there are any complaints about DeBrusk it's that we haven't seen that higher gear or next level of production some were hoping to see from him with him coming to Vancouver. For better or for worse he's come exactly as advertised but it's only 1/4 of the way into the season and it's clear not everyone in the top 6 is firing on all cylinders at the same time.
canucks,lxs7xks,2024-11-18 12:15:11,DeBrusk and Petey have been so dominant this November. I think Petey has finally found an elite winger who can keep up offensively and defensively.DeBrusk has been noticeably fast physical and making some dangerous plays around the net. He'll fit right in. And the good thing is he's quite versatile as he looked great alongside Boeser and Miller too.The weak part of his game is common for many wingers in his salary bracket: very streaky scoring.
canucks,lxshutt,2024-11-18 13:04:48,he’s exactly what i expected. fast physical streaky scorer but will quietly put up the points and good defensively.real question is will he be able to turn it up a level in the playoffs like how he did in boston
canucks,lxt3nkg,2024-11-18 14:54:15,I’ve liked his game. Not the flashiest guy but he’s out there quietly putting up points. 10 points in 17 games is very solid. Would’ve been great to get a guy like Guentzel but $9M AAV (at least) is a lot. DeBrusk is great for $5M/yr and assuming he doesn’t drop off a cliff performance-wise in the latter half of his contract it’ll be a great deal in 2-3 years. He’ll be a very solid winger for us till his contract’s up. Do wish he was more consistently scoring goals though—he’s had some good chances but the puck luck hasn’t been on his side. Otherwise can’t complain.
canucks,lxsehra,2024-11-18 12:47:58,For what he’s paid I can’t complain I do think someone like Guentzel was the difference maker we needed to make an impact but he’s a serviceable top six player.
canucks,lxseuux,2024-11-18 12:49:47,good pick up no regrets at all
canucks,lxsuf8e,2024-11-18 14:07:50,he's had no puck luck but he's been in and around danger areas thus far and an inch or so from getting a good shot into the net.
canucks,lxtjcb2,2024-11-18 16:13:44,The word out of Boston was that he was always inconsistent during the season would move up and down from 1st to 4th line. He had opportunity but was never consistent. So far this year he's had one bad month and one good month. He will probably end the year with 40ish points. But he's always kicked into high gear for the playoffs to an astounding degree. So his reg season prison production isn't all that important IMO
canucks,lxtbrax,2024-11-18 15:35:40,3 goals in 17 games is a tough start for DeBrusk.  I think we’ll all be underwhelmed if he continues with this pace and ends up with 14 goals on the season.
canucks,lxsjwdq,2024-11-18 13:15:09,Imagine how thing our D would be then though
canucks,lxtq59j,2024-11-18 16:48:05,Yea he's $5.5M and has been a strong but secondary player as advertised - and that would be fine except we overpaid in term length to get way more value up front and right now I'm not seeing it.
canucks,lxssn3v,2024-11-18 13:58:51,we wouldn't be paying Desharnais probably
canucks,lxst2pi,2024-11-18 14:01:01,wait actually we probably wouldn't be paying Forbort or Desharnais then
canucks,lxsw5v1,2024-11-18 14:16:30,True lol I think debrusk is a solid fit though and less risk. Easier to keep BB if we choose too
canucks,lxtpdcf,2024-11-18 16:44:11,Yea we would have had to have skipped on one or both of Desharnais and Forbort who both have been so disappointing I don't think we'd even notice.
canucks,lxsvevr,2024-11-18 14:12:46,You can just edit a comment you don’t need to make two lolBut then our bottom pair is AHLers I don’t think you understand that’s worse
canucks,lxrblem,2024-11-18 09:19:13,Breakaway jerseys have always been awful and aren't worth their price. I would suggest refunding and either spending extra money for the premium or just spending less money and buying a fake
canucks,lxrab7g,2024-11-18 09:11:13,So get a refund and wait until you see the correct jersey 
canucks,lxs1yjz,2024-11-18 11:44:51,Fanatics Breakaways suck but everything i have seen is Fanatics premiums and adidas are pretty much the same
canucks,lxs2el4,2024-11-18 11:47:07,What am I missing? What’s wrong with the “A”?
canucks,lxt22iv,2024-11-18 14:46:14,The spelling errors out of Fanatics are just comical at this point.Surprised we aren't seeing the Vuncouver Canacks.
canucks,lxrbsnk,2024-11-18 09:20:27,I'm considering it my main gripe with fakes is I never seem to get ones that have the right typeface which is by far my biggest pet peeve**UPDATE AS THIS IS THE TOP COMMENT**:It's come to my attention that apparently Fanatics just decided to phone it in when it comes to typefaces and they don't use Umlauts on their jerseys at all. Who the hell knows why and that's another conversation as to why Fanatics think it's alright to just drop the proper lettering.[Here's the Premium Skate $250 jersey from them for Räty also missing them](https://fanatics.frgimages.com/lf?set=key[name]value[RATY]&set=key[number]value[54]&call=url[http://dmimages.ff.p10/chains/202055734.txt]&scale=size[900]&sink)[And here's the Höglander one same thing](https://fanatics.frgimages.com/vancouver-canucks/mens-fanatics-nils-hoglander-blue-vancouver-canucks-home-premier-breakaway-player-jersey_ss5_p-201452162+pv-1+u-f1rod727qrg0usxh6cds+v-isirglgpdqs6mn4lzkoc.jpg?_hv=2&w=900)However [here's Lekkerimäki the other night](https://imgur.com/UQlyIfj) and his jersey clearly has them on it. So the pros get real spelling and we get shafted.
canucks,lxraiqt,2024-11-18 09:12:33,It'll probably come to that but who knows when that'll be and will they get it right at the second time of asking
canucks,lxs2qil,2024-11-18 11:48:47,It should be Ä
canucks,lxsq2rx,2024-11-18 13:46:09,That Hoggy one is a breakaway. You can tell by the tag that'd be above your front pocket wearing it. I haven't seen a Premium irl to know if they include the umlaut though
canucks,lxrdxq0,2024-11-18 09:33:38,Yeah I've personally never seen a fake I like and am okay spending the extra money for a jersey once every few years but I understand why people go for them over $300 jerseys
canucks,lxswkcb,2024-11-18 14:18:31,The Jerseys that players wear are the $800 made in Canada ones.
canucks,lxs4ro6,2024-11-18 11:59:03,The skate fakes are usually done well compared to orca
canucks,lxrypww,2024-11-18 11:28:18,You can get this season's jerseys for $50-100 on SVP as early as this off season.
canucks,lxss4wf,2024-11-18 13:56:22,They will give you your money back and you’re  upset? 
canucks,lxs3c35,2024-11-18 11:51:48,That’s not a problem with the “A” it’s just missing the Umlauts. You won’t ever find a fanatics jersey with those on it just like they don’t ever put alternate captain “A” on any jersey either. You’d need a custom one to be able to get that. Where did you order it from? It also doesn’t even have a name bar on it. I’d 100% return it and get a Premium blank and have it properly customized
canucks,lxsqtkg,2024-11-18 13:49:52,[Seems like it's the same in the premium](https://www.fanatics.com/nhl/vancouver-canucks/vancouver-canucks-fanatics-alternate-premium-custom-jersey-black/o-8039+t-36379763+p-796646888020+z-8-3212405866?_ref=p-DLP:m-GRID:i-r0c2:po-2&aid=300746)They have the Lekkerimaki and Raty in the Adidas Primegreen as well but the image doesn't change. I can only assome there's no correct letters in those too
canucks,lxsxea4,2024-11-18 14:22:40,Yeah I'm aware but we're talking about grammatical marks not overall jersey quality
canucks,lxt8r21,2024-11-18 15:20:22,I have a miller premium fanatic and it does have the A on the front. Don't need to order custom.
canucks,lxs3q86,2024-11-18 11:53:47,I ordered it from Fanatics and it was their name choice in the dropdown not my own custom option. They have the umlauts on the jerseys you can see so here: https://imgur.com/UQlyIfj
canucks,lxsyas6,2024-11-18 14:27:13,Point being fanatics are not involved with player worn jerseys at all. They're made in Quebec and they just put Adidas or fanatics logo on them. Just because MiC ones have it doesn't mean fanatics ever had it or has any intention of adding it.
canucks,lxt8xpc,2024-11-18 15:21:17,Where did you get it from?
canucks,lxs4b5l,2024-11-18 11:56:44,The game jerseys are not customized by Fanatics. The ones Fanatics sells in the breakaway version won’t have them. Thats why I suggest you buy a blank and have it customized by a 3rd party. Also PSA to anyone else reading this that may not be familiar with Fanatics don’t buy breakaway jerseys and especially don’t buy customized ones. Buy blank premium and have it properly customized afterwards
canucks,lxszino,2024-11-18 14:33:19,Understandable it's just frustrating that of all corners you'd expect them to cut the *spelling* of the players name wouldn't be one of them
canucks,lxt93jk,2024-11-18 15:22:06,Team store at the arena.
canucks,lxs5kcn,2024-11-18 12:03:08,"I'm not against a premium one customised but the difference to a person like myself who is only wearing it to games and when i'm watching the game at home is that of a few hundreds dollars which isn't insignificant. I appreciate the quality but if the official vendor is offering something passable that I can just wear around for this price point then it's going to be more attractive. One can turn around and say ""well then don't complain you get what you pay for"" but at the end of the day we're talking about the spelling of a name not the actual build quality."
canucks,lxs56vx,2024-11-18 12:01:11,This is wild you seem to be correct and it's absolutely baffling why they would choose to not put them on.

canucks,lxt9abf,2024-11-18 15:23:03,Team store outs them on. They don’t come from Fanatics with the patch
canucks,lxs5y35,2024-11-18 12:05:05,Not really. How much did this one cost you? Shop around and the premium can be had for $139.99 CDN and the customization would be like $100-$125.
canucks,lxs5goe,2024-11-18 12:02:36,That’s just how they operate. Definitely return it get a blank premium and have it properly customized.
canucks,lxt9e9p,2024-11-18 15:23:38,Ahh ok good note.
canucks,lxs6emb,2024-11-18 12:07:26,this cost me £127.95 shipped I live in the UK so getting anything shipped here is another conversation as well.
canucks,lxs6vow,2024-11-18 12:09:51,Ok. Fair enough. If you have a shop locally that does any sort of team customizations for any sports jersey they should be able to cut you some twill umlauts and heat press them on.
canucks,lxs744j,2024-11-18 12:11:03,I'll look into that although might be worried about the colour matching
canucks,lxrrsg2,2024-11-18 10:51:48,Rick Tocchet’s aversion to timeouts is starting to piss me off. In the last two minutes last night why are we sending the fourth line out there with our bottom d pairing? Take a fucking timeout let Quinn and Petey rest then get your best players on the ice
canucks,lxs0c7v,2024-11-18 11:36:37,This was the first regulation loss where I felt like we actually looked okay (as opposed to just getting blown out like all of our other losses). Weird game where Sherwood whiffing on his breakaway literally may have changed the outcome as they scored right after. Even if he gets a shot on and a whistle that other goal doesn't happen.Also nice to see Petey out there like this. He looks physically bigger when he is playing well. I have loved his game this home stand.This team can't get on the road soon enough.
canucks,lxrxtob,2024-11-18 11:23:40,If there’s one silver lining it’s that Petey has been dominant. That one timer was sexy
canucks,lxt6osk,2024-11-18 15:09:42,2 minutes left offensive zone faceoff with our best players tired why not take a timeout and pull the goalie I am confused
canucks,lxryx7c,2024-11-18 11:29:20,I feel like I’m being gaslighted into thinking this team is still good and at the same time being gaslighted into thinking that this team is bad and took a step back . I truly don’t know what to believe and how to feel. Yet the league and division standings show we are doing just fine otherwise. American thanksgiving is coming up which is the barometer used to gauge whether teams are playoff contenders or not. Still a lot of games left but the alternating win-lose-win-lose especially doing so badly at home games is discouraging and infuriating. 
canucks,lxrr9tp,2024-11-18 10:49:04,We've had 5 or more goals scored on us in 5 of our 10 home games. Absolutely unacceptable for what should be a top 10 team.
canucks,lxrsnzc,2024-11-18 10:56:27,I may have set my expectations way too high at the start of the season lol
canucks,lxs8xi4,2024-11-18 12:20:12,My concern is if we don’t fix the 2nd D pairing soon we won’t even be in a position to acquire players come TDL.Whenever Soucy/Myers are out on the ice we get absolutely caved in and it results in extended shift in our end of the ice.There is a drastic difference in possession o-zone time and chance generation with Hughes and Hronek on the ice and without. We don’t need another monster pairing that wins the CORSI numbers. We just need another pair that can just play 18-19 minutes a night without losing your match up. No need to put up goals/points but just have to ensure the opponent doesn’t get as many chances as they get on a regular basis. Essentially just even the match up not necessarily having to win the match up.Right now we don’t have that middle pairing. We need to figure it out.
canucks,lxseimv,2024-11-18 12:48:05,Anyone else just laugh at the people who call Nashville the worst team in the NHL as if they were like chicago calibur of players instead of new team new system not gelling yetAt the end of the day we seem to be weak mentally non calls on penalties and icings seem to affect the boys for spurts and its painful to watch.also we need to sort out our D ir D system if we hope to do playoffs well again too many uncovered guys getting free looks and too many cross crease passes where a D doesnt intercept the pass or check the shooter
canucks,lxrwvad,2024-11-18 11:18:41,Canucks are lucky the rest of the division is bad so our slow start doesn’t affect the standings too much. With a win in our next game we would be 1 point out of first place with the same amount of games.
canucks,lxrmbrx,2024-11-18 10:22:17,I know Lankinen had a great start to the season but it's now been 3 or 4 games where he hasn't been good. He hasn't been letting in outright bad goals but he has been getting beat clean and also overplaying a lot of shots resulting in big scramble plays. I think the workload is starting to catch up to him so tocchet should try to give silovs a few more starts
canucks,lxr48ty,2024-11-18 08:31:46,Really want to know why Miller got benched in the third. Our lines are all over the place this season.
canucks,lxs277o,2024-11-18 11:46:04,"I get tocchet wanting to punish miller for his lack of effort in the last couple games but 2 mins left and down a goal you have to play your best players. I have always been a critic of miller when he is coasting but you send him out to get a goal. We already don't have boeser miller was benched for 10+ minutes the message is clear. On another note i wish we stopped being so fixated on our ""system"" seeing hughes skate to the blue line on the pp with speed and no one really contesting then do a drop pass that the entire league is aware of is starting to annoy me."
canucks,lxsp28u,2024-11-18 13:41:02,It’s pretty clear to me that Miller is playing injured which once again raises the question of why this team seems insistent on playing players through injuries in meaningless games. I get Boeser is out now too but what good is the depth the team has been flaunting if the team can’t lean on it to get their best players healthy for when it matters?
canucks,lxsu32y,2024-11-18 14:06:08,Let’s put Miller to Petey’s wing and let him play out of it.
canucks,lxsavpf,2024-11-18 12:29:58,Its important to keep a reasonable perspective on this team.We're dealing with injuries to key players and Petey until recently has been MIA for the start of the season.  When you have Demko Joshua Boeser out Miller playing hurt and Petey coasting for portions of the season you're gonna feel it.  If not for guys like Lankinen Sherwood Hughes Suter and others in the lineup picking up the slack I think we'd be way lower in the standings.When the team shows up we can go toe to toe with anyone in the league for sure.That said things like playing right from puck drop has nothing to do with who's in the starting lineup. The team lacks energy and in way more games than not require 10-15 minutes of the first before they start skating. To me this is a coaching issue and a preparation issue. Not sure how they fix it but its a far cry from last season and that contract is jarring. I gotta say I've not been as impressed with our coaching this season (so far)As far as this game is concerned end of the day we lost to a team who is last place in the standings. You can argue that they don't belong there all you want - we still lost to a team that we should not have. That happens from time to time but when you factor in that our win versus another bottom dweller in Chicago was so unconvincing (really it was like a 2-1 win) it doesn't bode well when we face some actual competition.I do think we just need to keep our expectations lower until we get back to a healthy roster. We've seen what the likes of Petey JT Garlang/Joshua Boeser and co can do when firing. we are a 3 line threat and now our 4th line is more dangerous as well.If we can put emphasis on our D and get that additional top 4D we so desperately need we will be fine.
canucks,lxsvnxs,2024-11-18 14:14:00,"Anyone else hate that Nashville might use that win as a rallying point for their season? I hate that we were responsible for that if they turn their season around. I can see the Nashville radio/podcast shows saying it being a ""statement game"" for them getting revenge on their 1st round foes."
canucks,lxrjzuq,2024-11-18 10:09:10,Preds fan here. I missed the last two periods with it being a real late game locally but I just watched the highlights. I have missed Sherwood in a preds jersey and it looks like he has been putting in work for you all. What do the fans think of him so far?
canucks,lxrydbn,2024-11-18 11:26:30,At this point I'm willing to explore bringing in Matt Benning$1.25M this year and next almost all of it is buriable if it doesn't work out. The Leafs had him on waivers and he was essentially a cap dump from the Sharks so it wouldn't cost anything. Since 2022-23 he had a 47% xGF which isn't great but only Erik Karlsson was better in that category on the Sharks in more minutes. He was also last in offensive zone start % at just 22%. So for tough deployments he actually hasn't done too terribly. This is mostly in top-4 minutes as well as Benning has averaged 19:07 since 22-23.I will say that he had hip surgery and missed almost all of last year and most of his numbers came from 2022-23 so there's no telling if the same player is even there. But at this point low-risk options like this should be considered. No one is giving you a fair price right now for a true top-4 D so finding one is really the only option.
canucks,lxsd2zk,2024-11-18 12:40:58,As smart as we all say the management team is signing DeBrusk and extending Myers and Hoglander are all looking like pretty bad decisions sp far. I had someone last night telling me that DeBrusk's advanced stats are really good but who cares if he's not scoring goals?
canucks,lxsdcyb,2024-11-18 12:42:21,Yeah it was crazy that we pulled the goalie and Hughes was on the bench because he needed a breather. That should never happen. That's on the coach to make sure he rolls the lines properly so the best players are out there when the goalie is pulled.
canucks,lxu57vv,2024-11-18 18:08:56,You're right he's looking more and more imposing. Sort of hulking barreling down on you for the puck.
canucks,lxs9j97,2024-11-18 12:23:14,Vintage Petey. I literally shot up out of my chair when that went in. What a snipe
canucks,lxu37w2,2024-11-18 17:57:34,The answer to your question is the same as why we never take timeouts. Tocchet can be really stubborn
canucks,lxs2x6u,2024-11-18 11:49:43,Honestly if you factor in the massive PDO bender we started with last year (including not having Demko) we’re pretty equivalent. There were so many games we got shelled but Demko was a god and we scored like 5 goals on 17 shots. Our overall game really tightened up as the year went on so once our bounces went back to normal we remained strong. We just gotta hope we figure things out the same way.
canucks,lxs3svx,2024-11-18 11:54:09,It’s def been a weird start. On a positive note I’ll say that a lot of the analytics models really like how we’ve been playing this season we’re a top 10 team by pretty much all of them and a top 5 team in a few that I’ve seen. Additionally we’re solidly in a playoff spot despite missing our vezina candidate goalie and not having either Miller or Pettersson elite at the same time or fully healthy. On a negative note there are some glaring weaknesses that need to be addressed. Our 2nd and 3rd pair defence is way too slow
canucks,lxs7wg7,2024-11-18 12:15:02,Allvin doesn’t have the luxury for a quiet trade deadline that’s for sure.
canucks,lxs75xv,2024-11-18 12:11:19,Same. We're not playing our best but we've had a soft schedule. There's so many things on both sides so I don't know. Truth is without Demko we can't judge this team properly
canucks,lxt63yh,2024-11-18 15:06:44,The Canucks are going through a similar issue that plagued the Whitecaps season - they never had their best players together until playoffs (where we pummeled Portland away 5-0 in a wildcard spot and nearly beat LAFC in first round after having a bad losing streak during regular season). There's a lot of important pieces (i.e. Demko Boeser) who are injured or players who aren't playing well at the moment (JT Miller).And early hockey season is a crapshoot anyways. Everyone in my fantasy league says the season is a shitshow until after Christmas.Definitely doesn't look good to lose to Nashville but on paper they're a good team. Things just haven't been working out for them just like last season they played poorly until they cancelled a U2 tour to go on and clinch a playoff spot.
canucks,lxs97gw,2024-11-18 12:21:36,Its pretty simple. This team does not show up for the start of their game and does not put in a full 60 minute effort of focused controlled hockey. And this behavior is against bottom dwelling teams as well. It's indicative of a recurring issue that is either roster related or systems related. The only argument against this is that the team had a lot of turnover and they need to gel and break into the system. However we're less than 2 weeks away from US Thanksgiving... its not really fair to say they're still getting used to the system. Only conclusion I can come up with is that this team is flawed and the defense constructed poorly. But the good news is that the fix seems rather simple. Alvin took a bad gamble reupping Myers and keeping Soucy. Team needs a trade for a top 4 defenseman and then we can re-evaluate. I expect the roster to perform much better once that is the case.
canucks,lxts7nu,2024-11-18 16:58:34,I'd agree but the price for dmen rentals this year is likely going to be high with not many available. If the rest of the team isn't healthy and clicking I don't know that we want to spend as much as we did last year knowing it will leave us without much to spend in other years. The asset pool is incredibly shallow.
canucks,lxsnt7h,2024-11-18 13:34:45,I think trading for Pettersson would be enough because then we can send Myers down to the third pairing with Brannstrom and Pettersson can help Soucy out.
canucks,lxrwqhb,2024-11-18 11:17:58,I don’t think its that hes a bad goalie but I do think tocc has overworked him. He looks like hes got a cold or something the last few games
canucks,lxrthln,2024-11-18 11:00:48,Šilovs has earn the start tomorrow IMO
canucks,lxriv0x,2024-11-18 10:02:40,Because he was ass. Been ass for weeks now. It was simply about time
canucks,lxroulh,2024-11-18 10:36:04,Miller on the pk sucked. His shifts tonight were not it. He’s injured and it’s affecting the game so he was benched
canucks,lxrskdl,2024-11-18 10:55:56,Sometimes coach has to send a message even to star players
canucks,lxs6rx2,2024-11-18 12:09:19,Going to have to disagree on this one. Lose the battle and win the war type of mentality for Tocchet which I think sends the right message.If you've played like crap for more than a week now then no you don't deserve to be out in the dying seconds of the game to play hero. It sends the wrong message to the rest of the team when everyone else has been hustling and playing better.If Miller is injured he needs to be played sparingly but if not then his performance needs to pick up. We'd be saying the same thing about Pettersson if that was the case. Hopefully this is the wakeup call Miller needs to play better.
canucks,lxs8z6e,2024-11-18 12:20:26,"""but 2 mins left and down a goal you have to play your best players""Tocc rightfully didn't think and feel that JT was one of our best players last night so why would he put him out there then? He put out who he thought gave us the best chance to win.. I can respect that even if he went with someone who I might not have fully agreed with. But cmon JT was struggling.. you'd have as many people yelling at him if he DID put JT on - ""Why put JT? he was a no-show all night - literally put ANYONE ELSE"" is what you'd see up and down the PGT. Where Tocc continues to flounder in my opinion are in two (maybe 3) key areas.     1) Team is once again not ready to play at puck drop. Its an all too common theme this season and we're close to tops in the league for getting scored on first. He has to have the team ready to go from minute 1. 2) He appears to be allergic to taking time outs. We are a goal down net empty and he doesn't take it to give a bit of extra rest with a potential comeback on the line.. I can't think of a reason why not to call one there. It just makes no sense. 3) Powerplay - I mention this but really the PP has been better of late but overall has still be super underwhelming this season. yes the players need to get it done so its not all on tocc but ultimately he takes some of the blame for the lackluster PP overall this season. He needs to figure all of the above out. Also stop putting the lines in a blender as soon as we get scored on. Unless of course he really doesn't like some of the matchups that are happening."
canucks,lxtqrdg,2024-11-18 16:51:11,"It seems pretty obvious Miller hasn't been able to play full minutes for a while now and that playing him hurt in a back to back was a mistake - but you won't see the team say that. Instead he's just ""not one of the guys that were gonna get us back into the game""."
canucks,lxu3f3i,2024-11-18 17:58:42,Well we let them do it. It is what it is
canucks,lxub35e,2024-11-18 18:42:56,Couldn’t care less.  In fact I’d be happy if they could start beating some of our pacific division rivals
canucks,lxrophm,2024-11-18 10:35:18,He’s top in the league for hits. Skates his ass off. We love him. Sad this game ended the way it did the refs missed calls on both sides and the Nucks just caved with it
canucks,lxs7j0y,2024-11-18 12:13:09,He’s a literal predator hunting down opponents but lucky for us and Hughes is wearing the orca crest. We love him!!!!
canucks,lxrzk2b,2024-11-18 11:32:40,My brother is a Sharks fan and apparently Matt Benning is AHL quality.
canucks,lxsdqhk,2024-11-18 12:44:13,I swear every time I see a comment from you it’s usually the worst take I’ve ever heard
canucks,lxsrj1i,2024-11-18 13:53:20,Myers was pure money in the playoffs where gigantic D-men really come to the fore. They resigned him for cheap. His pairing with Soucy last season was one of our best this season they're struggling... but there's a lot of runway left! DeBrusk is still fairly fresh on a new team and is only now playing with a high functioning Pettersson. He's also shown his talent multiple times. Hoglander I'd argue played with a ton of tenacity against Nashville.
canucks,lxtuo2l,2024-11-18 17:11:24,> the fix seems rather simpleTop 4 RHD have always commanded a high price this year they will be more expensive than ever due to there only being one or two that aren't already tied into long term deals that we can't afford.
canucks,lxtr4uw,2024-11-18 16:53:05,Soucy sucked on the right side which is why Cole did it last year. Pettersson is coming in to bump Soucy down. Then maybe you get Brannstrom playing his off side if he can on the third pair with Soucy. Soucys been the worst of the second pair by a pretty wide margin almost all the way back to his injury last year.
canucks,lxro28e,2024-11-18 10:31:46,Apparently we can only have 1 of our 2 top-6 C's going at any one timeedit: typo
canucks,lxtss4a,2024-11-18 17:01:30,I think the 17 minutes he played against Calgary and Chicago both games he was producing in tells us this isn't about him being punished for being bad. It's not surprising that ignoring the injury isn't working in the third game in 4 nights.
canucks,lxtw5qd,2024-11-18 17:19:22,I get not wanting to tip injuries to opponents and all I just wish the team would provide a little more cover for their stars when they’re struggling for good reason.
canucks,lxrvmlm,2024-11-18 11:12:10,I miss the energy. It was crazy how many chances he created because he was an aggressive F1 hunting pucks. I heard he was up on the 2nd line last night does he normally play 3rd?If we miss out on the playoffs I’m rooting for y’all!
canucks,lxt8cqg,2024-11-18 15:18:19,I think some people want perfection like they wanted Guentzel over Debrusk but what can you do you know? There is some value in heavy/tall players especially in the playoffs so Myers is fine.What we need is someone that can drive the 2nd D pair and bump either Soucy/Myers down.
canucks,lxsybka,2024-11-18 14:27:19,The amount of people in the GT hating on höglander after the penalty and bling him for everything that went wrong was rough like Petey is finally looking solid so who’s next to hate on.
canucks,lxu5iqr,2024-11-18 18:10:40,I didnt say anything about a top 4 RHD. Just.... any top 4 D. RHD would be a bonus.
canucks,lxu0rd3,2024-11-18 17:44:04,I was thinking Pettersson bumps Myers down and plays on the right side.
canucks,lxtxuvc,2024-11-18 17:28:28,I don't get playing him in back to backs if he already can barely make it through a game. We're taking risks managing injuries like it's the playoffs in November. If this was the second round you sure as hell roll out a half broken Miller - lie to the media - and scrape your way through each game. But this is November for a team in an okay spot in the standings playing a condensed part of the schedule.
canucks,lxu3nc3,2024-11-18 17:59:59,Everyone and their mother knew McDavid had a sprained ankle. Why were they so open about it?
canucks,lxsrzyo,2024-11-18 13:55:41,He started on the 4th line moved to the 3rd and they looked great for awhile and then when Joshua came back we reunited the 3rd line we had for a lot of last year and Sherwood ended up being moved up as a result!
canucks,lxstpiz,2024-11-18 14:04:15,I think for the most part our wingers have been moving up and down the lineup as needed save for Boeser and DeBrusk. We had Heinen in the top 6 for a moment Garland got some looks too and now Sherwood is the guy moving up the lineup to allow us to reunite our Good Job Boys/No Name line of Joshua Blueger Garland
canucks,lxtruri,2024-11-18 16:56:45,Hoggy was having a pretty good game and took a dumb penalty. Realistically our problems were our Miller line was doing good but Petey's line was MIA. Now Petey is rolling but Millers line is broken. I don't know that there's a player that needs to be hated for that.
canucks,lxu2be7,2024-11-18 17:52:34,I wouldn't put our third best dman on his off side personally. I also don't know why we'd want Soucy to stay on the second pair over Myers. Honestly can't think of any reason that would make sense.
canucks,lxu47pq,2024-11-18 18:03:10,Mainly because Pettersson has experience on his offside so he'll be a better offside choice than Brannstrom.
canucks,lxu57wc,2024-11-18 18:08:56,I'd really just want to lean into the best second pair we can put out there using our third and fourth best dmen in their natural spots rather than try to improve the third pair.
canucks,lxqo3u3,2024-11-18 06:22:12,beauties. love that boeser.
canucks,lxswyyz,2024-11-18 14:20:33,Raaaaaaate your toe!

canucks,lxsfswt,2024-11-18 12:54:30,yes  I posted a couple a Mogilny salmon skate and a Bert on ice navy orca.
canucks,lxttxif,2024-11-18 17:07:29,Imma check it out!
canucks,lxqdkht,2024-11-18 04:28:59,We can’t even beat one of the slowest teams (Isles) and the currently worst placing team (Preds) so in true Canuck fashion we will get dominated but almost lose this game and squeak by with an ugly win.
canucks,lxq9j73,2024-11-18 03:43:22,I guess we'll find out Tuesday
canucks,lxqz9qo,2024-11-18 07:56:47,I have done hundreds of hours of research. Looked at all the underlying stats of both teams and done many regression analyses. I have come to the conclusion that the Canucks will win or lose 99% of the time. The final percent is if a fire-breathing dragon crushes Rogers Arena resulting in an automatic recapture penalty for the Canucks.
canucks,lxqbz5n,2024-11-18 04:10:53,10-0 Vancouver.
canucks,lxqdl1f,2024-11-18 04:29:09,We'll win. It won't be a miracle though.
canucks,lxqf6iv,2024-11-18 04:47:19,Canucks are a pretty damn good team they'll put up a good fight. I think Rangers and Canucks are in similar boats this year in terms of disappointing starts but excellent rosters.
canucks,lxsa4w3,2024-11-18 12:26:14,The team will come out flat for the first 50 minutes and get shellacked. Heading into the final 10 we'll be down 4-1 with single digit per period shot totals. Hughes and Pettersson will go beast mode tie it up in the dying seconds. 35 seconds into overtime one of Myers Juulsen or Soucy will whiff a breakout and the Rags pot a bar down snipe. 5-4 Rags. The fanbase will postulate it was a hard earned point against an out of conference perennial contender but no one will be able to convince themselves that we're not actually as good as our roster should be.
canucks,lxrfx6w,2024-11-18 09:45:35,The Rangers are going to run Vancouver out of the building. If they can't be the Islanders and Nashville. Then what do you think the Rangers are going to do to the team.
canucks,lxrlpnw,2024-11-18 10:18:51,Win
canucks,lxrqhu7,2024-11-18 10:44:55,I'm going to the game I refuse to vote :(
canucks,lxs631i,2024-11-18 12:05:47,4-3 regulation loss
canucks,lxsajh6,2024-11-18 12:28:16,The petey goal against them again
canucks,lxqxpnl,2024-11-18 07:45:10,A win if Silovs plays
canucks,lxskvsw,2024-11-18 13:20:06,The only wrong thing about this statement is that Myers Juulsen and Soucy will be on the ice in overtime unless it’s a PK
canucks,lxql1z1,2024-11-18 05:51:04,Ok so that eliminates my he's got a broken heart because Boesser is out theory.
canucks,lxq806h,2024-11-18 03:26:08,#ENHANCE 
canucks,lxqkj3i,2024-11-18 05:45:33,Why tf are they playing him on the PK?
canucks,lxrnh5u,2024-11-18 10:28:34,…Maybe his finger is itchy in his glove.
canucks,lxrx2am,2024-11-18 11:19:43,He took that slapper to the wrist the other game right? Gotta be something to do with that.
canucks,lxq7lt5,2024-11-18 03:21:42,Why does Tocchet lie in the postgame about this? Someone please help me understand what is gained from doing that…
canucks,lxrcizd,2024-11-18 09:25:01,Probably tendonitis he caught from Petey.
canucks,lxrpb16,2024-11-18 10:38:32,I didn't know if playing him on Tuesday is going to be the move. He seems to be getting worse.
canucks,lxsopm9,2024-11-18 13:39:17,We need to hire a team of the best wrist specialists to be on staff full time.
canucks,lxs39sw,2024-11-18 11:51:28,He has an incurable degenerative disc condition in his neck. Even with the steroids pain is real every game.
canucks,lxsgz1p,2024-11-18 13:00:18,Nobody want to comment on give aways by Meyers
canucks,lxq9gpc,2024-11-18 03:42:33,I guess 10M in cap space isn't enough injury we need 20M.
canucks,lxs1260,2024-11-18 11:40:19,He still might 
canucks,lxs9hyd,2024-11-18 12:23:04,It can be both 
canucks,lxtdu1r,2024-11-18 15:46:08,Enhance..
canucks,lxs1rqy,2024-11-18 11:43:54,Faceoffs is part of it. He was always our best faceoff forward which is huge for the PK.The obvious solution is Raty now that he’s called up. He’s even better than Miller at faceoffs and is a good PKer in Abby. It makes sense to eventually get him PKing
canucks,lxqkysl,2024-11-18 05:50:10,Gotta use him I guess?
canucks,lxq810s,2024-11-18 03:26:23,Only theory; he doesn't want teams targeting the injury
canucks,lxqdj99,2024-11-18 04:28:34,They said the same thing for like three months about Petey before he opened up about it in the year end presser. There were plenty of games where everyone was like “Petey is hobbled right?” And Tocchet’s presser would basically be him saying “no injury he just isn’t trying hard” in different words. (That played a massive part in the Petey doesn’t care anymore discourse imo)There were a few games before Lindholm went on IR where Tocchet basically said things the same way. It’s just the way they go about injuries. Super tight lipped. Maybe it’s an “injury is no excuse for effort” thing too. Miller was barely moving his feet on the PK so maybe Tocchet was pissed about that and wasn’t going to cover for his guy on that. Especially if it’s an arm thing.
canucks,lxrq0p4,2024-11-18 10:42:23,He didn't he only said the benching had nothing to do with injury.
canucks,lxs0dxd,2024-11-18 11:36:52,I don't think he got it from petey he seems happily married.
canucks,lxsmnkj,2024-11-18 13:28:55,Having a hand/wrist/finger injury has to hurt your faceoff ability.
canucks,lxs4nob,2024-11-18 11:58:29,That’s really the biggest thing. It’s how Pat Quinn came up with “upper body injury” since he knew players would target a player specifically because they were injured. So by saying upper body that could mean from rib fracture to a head ache.
canucks,lxskz72,2024-11-18 13:20:34,posts like these should be banned during playoffs just incase!
canucks,lxrua40,2024-11-18 11:05:02,Tocchet is old school - if you can suit up and play you are fine and injuries are no excuse.But this is on the Canucks FO for letting these guys continue to play IF they are injured.  Given our history it’s likely that they believe or they won’t hold players back if the injury can’t get worse by playing (which is the biggest crock of shit ever).
canucks,lxrfmnq,2024-11-18 09:43:51,I have zero confidence in how this team handles injuries especially when it comes to players playing through it.Demko Petey Mikheyev Dickinson Pearson etc. have we not seen enough?
canucks,lxqu69s,2024-11-18 07:16:49,Exactly what this reminds me of. I remember being pissed at Petey in the playoffs because I thought if he has an injury the coach wouldn’t be putting his effort level on blast like this so it must not be injury related. The strange part was that Tocc continued to not really give the knee inflammation idea the time of day even after Petey revealed it. Tocc has always made it seem like Petey was choosing to not move his feet even as recently as earlier this season.Maybe Tocc is still very old school with stuff like that.
canucks,lxs79f8,2024-11-18 12:11:48,Wrists are attached to your upper body
canucks,lxtasfj,2024-11-18 15:30:44,They don't have any alternatives though. So if they're healthy enough to play they're going to play. You can't run Suter-Blueger-Raty-Aman at centre. Especially when your team has one proper top 6 winger and your only other actual top 6 winger is hurt.As for injuries getting worse depending on the injury they won't get worse necessarily but rehab while playing on something just slows to a crawl.
canucks,lxsb3rw,2024-11-18 12:31:05,Petey should've been rested or doing rehab from January-March and he would've been a difference maker in the playoffs. I'm a little concerned he is still playing through it now but pushing through it harder cause it's kinda strange he just suddenly turned it on the last couple of weeks with no obvious sign of rest.
canucks,lxshgoi,2024-11-18 13:02:47,Lower body is attached to the upper body too
canucks,lxtl514,2024-11-18 16:22:44,My comments weren’t about benching miller or his deployment just the mentality of saying or thinking if you are healthy enough to skate you are healthy.  That’s an old school style of thought.
canucks,lxtahqi,2024-11-18 15:29:13,The thing about his knee injury is that it had a long time frame and playing on it wouldn't necessarily stop it from healing but just drag the process out longer. So it could be that its just finally come back enough now.Henrik talked about an injury he had one year where he asked if it would get worse if he played on it they said no. He asked how long would rehab while playing they said like 3-4 months + the summer. How long was rehab if he didn't play they said like 6-8 weeks. And him and the team chose to play through it because they preferred a 4 months recovery where they at least had a 60% Henrik in the lineup over having 0% Henrik for 2 months to then get 100% Henrik for the last two months of the year.
canucks,lxsm248,2024-11-18 13:25:58,That's crazy ankles are attached to the brain stem
canucks,lxu0xb6,2024-11-18 17:44:58,I'd rather have 100% Henrik tbh
canucks,lxsmrc9,2024-11-18 13:29:27,The thigh bones connected to the eye bone. The eye bo.. wait.

canucks,lxs6ji3,2024-11-18 12:08:07,He’s gotta start throwing his helmet
canucks,lxu9vxe,2024-11-18 18:35:57,Honestly who throws a shoe?
canucks,lxtdvxc,2024-11-18 15:46:24,This gave me serious flashbacks
canucks,lxs8u7m,2024-11-18 12:19:45,At one point Garly took off his helmet and threw it at an opposing player which is a super unfair instakill move and why everyone hates that friend that picks Garly in the games
canucks,lxsb7lk,2024-11-18 12:31:37,Garland with the golden gun
canucks,lxs968c,2024-11-18 12:21:26,Hahaha you had me at the first part with the throwing of the helmet. I was thinking that made sense. Garly op!
canucks,lxq547k,2024-11-18 02:54:29,Was there in person a lot of bullshit between the benches that went uncalled as well doubt the broadcast got a lot of it because puck was in different zones.forsberg is lowkey a dirty ass bitch seeing all that shit live
canucks,lxq7cup,2024-11-18 03:18:56,Only one that drives me nuts is a non-icing call but the d slow-skates and earns the call.Hate it whichever way it goes.
canucks,lxqsr7w,2024-11-18 07:04:46,I feel like whenever Nashville is in town the reffing is heavily biased towards them. My first Canucks game I ever went to was against Nashville and it was the game that sparked the whole Burrows and Auger controversy. I remember the entire arena chanting Bullshit and Ref you suck as well as Luongo breaking his stick over the net at the end of the game.Fun times.
canucks,lxq3beb,2024-11-18 02:34:57,Not wrong. My thoughts exactly
canucks,lxqi69n,2024-11-18 05:20:18,Only one I cared about was the icing non call but other than that we got our chances on the PP just couldn't get anything going.
canucks,lxq34vd,2024-11-18 02:33:02,Did you also notice whenever the Canucks didn’t get called for one?
canucks,lxs4zc6,2024-11-18 12:00:08,"it was so bad when we would dump in the puck and at least 2 of their guys would always ""accidentally"" be in the way"
canucks,lxsjv7k,2024-11-18 13:15:00,What frustrated me was the icing calls some were really iffy and they barely called icing on the preds
canucks,lxreiv8,2024-11-18 09:37:13,I hope the next game against the sexual predators in trashville is a Canucks blowout 7-0
canucks,lxq2hm5,2024-11-18 02:26:10,I get what you mean but we can’t even score on the power play so does it even matter
canucks,lxsx9qr,2024-11-18 14:22:03,What did Forsberg do
canucks,lxqb7zm,2024-11-18 04:02:23,Yeah dal gato or whatever his name is.The tackle on blueger really stood out to me.But there was a hook on Hughes an interference against garland a bunch more non calls that just made this one feel like a rodeo.And then to call garland on that chincy hold was icing on the shit cake! Imo
canucks,lxsc6ph,2024-11-18 12:36:31,I feel like we get a lot of those called on us because we're trying to do center ice tip-ins and flip outs so often the linesmen just don't give us the benefit of the doubt and call more than they should to try to stop it.
canucks,lxtkppn,2024-11-18 16:20:36,I've always wondered about this because I always watch with my dad and it pisses him off so much he swears about it constantly... But... Is there a rule the d has to skate and try to get it? Playing devil's advocate a little (because it is annoying when they fake effort..) but it seems to me that one way of looking at it is icing is icing. Doesn't matter how fast the d skates. Maybe? or is there a rule I'm not aware of?The other thing that I've long wondered is shouldn't icing be different than a legitimately missed pass? If a player isn't under any pressure and they just miss a long pass (which should be a good part of the game) it's a completely different thing to being under pressure and chucking it down the ice... Just some thoughts.
canucks,lxq4ejt,2024-11-18 02:46:42,OP said blatant penalties.
canucks,lxq2n3i,2024-11-18 02:27:48,But we did...tonight and last night
canucks,lxq3oua,2024-11-18 02:38:59,just because you can’t score on a power play doesn’t mean the ref shouldn’t call it. not saying we lost because of the reffing but the consistency of the reffing tonight was frustrating
canucks,lxt198q,2024-11-18 14:42:08,He gave Lekk a cheapshot crosscheck on line change and gave garly a few punches couple times throughout the night.  Love how garland agitates everyone just wish it resulted in more PP for us
canucks,lxqle1f,2024-11-18 05:54:33,They talked about this in the broadcast. Said the same about Delgato faking out the refs that he's putting in effort to skate but shaking his shoulders the whole way.
canucks,lxtoa5e,2024-11-18 16:38:39,Yes if the D slows up then refs are supposed to waive it off. They don't have to sprint but they have to have been able to retrieve it and then slowed up - refs waive it off at that point. Its a tough call to make on the ice I'm sure sometimes but sometimes its painfully obvious
canucks,lxq3gl8,2024-11-18 02:36:32,power-play percentage of 22.0 this season
canucks,lxtbxx0,2024-11-18 15:36:36,Jeeze the broadcast really misses a lot of the background action!
canucks,lxttnra,2024-11-18 17:06:04,"Yeah you're right. I finally decided to look it up: ""If in the opinion of the Official a player of the opposing team except the goaltender is able to play the puck but chooses not do so.""Seems a bit flawed to me. A really fast skater could probably often catch the puck but chooses not to. So those slow ""fake effort"" skates should always make it called off. Weird..."
canucks,lxq6qeq,2024-11-18 03:12:02,You realize 22% is actually a pretty solid power play? In the top 1/3 of the league roughly. Could it be better sure. But its not terrible like you seem to think.
canucks,lxq3me4,2024-11-18 02:38:16,You said we can't score on pp when we clearly can like we're in the top half of pp% in the league so I'm not really sure what you mean.
canucks,lxq6z7x,2024-11-18 03:14:45,Which is above average? We're ranked 11th this year. The median PP last year was ~21%.
canucks,lxq8f58,2024-11-18 03:30:45,And with petey starting to return to form the powerplay should get better

bostonbruins,lxub748,2024-11-18 18:43:35,They're not waiting...  They have options and opportunities but everyone seems scared to shoot the fucking puck.

bostonbruins,lxua42e,2024-11-18 18:37:16,Sending some good juju from down under then.
bostonbruins,lxs407s,2024-11-18 11:55:11,finally some moves to get slower.
bostonbruins,lxsbywx,2024-11-18 12:35:26,Maybe this is just a ploy to get him on a line with Pasta. We can call it the Parmesan line.
bostonbruins,lxs8wf7,2024-11-18 12:20:03,Our coaching staff and front office hates fun.
bostonbruins,lxs8tg7,2024-11-18 12:19:39,But we need offense...
bostonbruins,lxs7qgi,2024-11-18 12:14:11,Rev up those duckboats
bostonbruins,lxrtjau,2024-11-18 11:01:04,Who da fook is that guy
bostonbruins,lxrugoy,2024-11-18 11:06:00,look I have nothing against Viel he's carved himself out a nice career as an AHL tough guy and there is some value in having someone like this in the system that will protect your prospects from other AHL goons. Didn't watch the game but I believe he jumped in to defend Poitras last game to stop someone from going after him there is value in that.But the fact that he's on our NHL roster while Poitras and Lysell are both in Providence is genuinely kind of laughable.
bostonbruins,lxsopnf,2024-11-18 13:39:17,It is *incredible* how many people are commenting about Lysell's play this year when it's abundantly clear that a single second hasn't been watched by those making the commentsIf you don't feel Lysell is an option because of like for like fine. An absolute buster like Viel before a guy like Kuntar or Duran or Farranacci (or god forbid Lysell slotted higher in the lineup while you fill a lower line with a guy playing higher than his standing. You're allowed to do that you know) is malpractice - straight up
bostonbruins,lxrs17v,2024-11-18 10:53:06,Can’t score more than 2 goals a game but yeah let’s call up the guy with 2g 2a in 14 games in providence. Honest to fuck can Sweeney be gone please?
bostonbruins,lxru5s5,2024-11-18 11:04:23,McLaughlin is 5-1-6 in his last 5 games and we’re calling up this bum who is 2-2-4 in 14 gp. All you can do is laugh

bostonbruins,lxs1qt6,2024-11-18 11:43:47,Time to sit March and pasta
bostonbruins,lxsjg7z,2024-11-18 13:12:54,Is this a Kastelic thing
bostonbruins,lxu2dud,2024-11-18 17:52:56,Viel gut player
bostonbruins,lxrs3oi,2024-11-18 10:53:27,WHERE THE FUCK IS LYSELL
bostonbruins,lxrwjwo,2024-11-18 11:17:00,Poitras and Lysell???  Really?  They've had time to prove themselves and it hasn't happened yet.  I though Merkulov played a better game than Poitras has.  McLoughlin played better his first time up than this year. What's wrong with bringing up someone while Kastelic is out?  Maybe he's a good locker room guy.
bostonbruins,lxs8emo,2024-11-18 12:17:33,Just another goon… but not a good goon 
bostonbruins,lxs7nbd,2024-11-18 12:13:44,There must be a god because my prayers are finally answered
bostonbruins,lxtzd65,2024-11-18 17:36:35,Gritty player plays with an edge. Not sure how much that's what this team needs but I like the idea of seeing what he can do in Boston
bostonbruins,lxs5eho,2024-11-18 12:02:17,Viel is filling the tough guy role while our tough guy is out. It’s not Lysell because Lysell 1. isn’t a tough guy and 2. can’t score at the AHL level.
bostonbruins,lxsc899,2024-11-18 12:36:43,People please lol  I’m a Bruin fan but I say it the way I see it and the way it looks no sugar coating  this team has become a joke because of poor management it doesn’t matter which player they bring up the talent level isn’t there. Lunch buckets like Zacha Coyle Fredrick Geekie are not going to help the young players if they can’t get their own game on track. When they put Marchy as captain was also a big mistake he’s nothing without Bergy. Pasta telegraphs everything he’s easy to check. Sweeney and Neely wait to long to make deals he should’ve traded Rask when he was still worth something instead he got nothing for him same as Marchy they probably won’t trade him and again lose him next year or over pay him next year. You guys may not agree but I’d be trading Marchy today while you can still get something good in return. CarloMarchy and I’m sure a couple of others should be traded in a package deal this team has no direction.
bostonbruins,lxs4x0o,2024-11-18 11:59:48,Poitras was sent down to work on specific skills and he’ll keep doing that. Lysell is a bust I’m here to tell you. Have you looked at his production this young season?
bostonbruins,lxs7aer,2024-11-18 12:11:57,Then McLaughlin looks to have more talent than being a fourth liner and this guy is a proven fourth line player?
bostonbruins,lxrv298,2024-11-18 11:09:11,He must be awful
bostonbruins,lxrycz4,2024-11-18 11:26:27,Lol Viel has looked better in Providence than Lysell. I swear some of you don’t watch their games then come in here because you have a mental image of what Lysell should be.The guy has looked bad and when you then look at his stats it confirms that as he has 1 goal and six helpers in 12 games.In no world is Lysell ready for the NHL right now.
bostonbruins,lxrwyw1,2024-11-18 11:19:12,Because this team can’t score goals and this guy does nothing to help with that
bostonbruins,lxs6tjb,2024-11-18 12:09:33,"Lysell puts up 50 points in 56 games last season""can't score at the AHL level"""
bostonbruins,lxsuxto,2024-11-18 14:10:23,this team desperately needs a tough guynot scoring or anything
bostonbruins,lxscy0j,2024-11-18 12:40:17,>he should’ve traded Rask when he was still worth somethingThere it is
bostonbruins,lxs3w5t,2024-11-18 11:54:38,he’s pretty good.
bostonbruins,lxsn3hq,2024-11-18 13:31:09,You actually haven't watched a second of Lysell this season if this is the takeaway
bostonbruins,lxrzk2x,2024-11-18 11:32:40,And Viel has 4 points in 14 games lol. How is that better?
bostonbruins,lxs40p7,2024-11-18 11:55:15,Are you expecting guys from providence to replace marchand and pasta in terms of scoring?  I think you're going to be disappointed
bostonbruins,lxs81x7,2024-11-18 12:15:47,What’s he done so far in this season to warrant a recall? I’m looking at this season’s product not last February.
bostonbruins,lxsus4k,2024-11-18 14:09:36,I knew we were in trouble when he was laughing at his own non-joke. including an emoji.
bostonbruins,lxtw9vv,2024-11-18 17:19:59,Haven’t needed to do this in a while but fuck anyone talking shit about the greatest Bruins goalie ever.
bostonbruins,lxs5262,2024-11-18 12:00:31,Yeah? Source?
bostonbruins,lxszyqt,2024-11-18 14:35:36,I watch essentially every game. Lysell is not NHL ready. It’s pretty clear why they are keeping him down there for now.
bostonbruins,lxs36s1,2024-11-18 11:51:02,Because he is filling the gap that Kastelic is leaving. You want Lysell to come in and have to be F1 on the 4th line forecheck?
bostonbruins,lxs5ev0,2024-11-18 12:02:20,Because of who he is replacing. You also don’t care about sending up a vet. You do care about fucking even more with an already struggling prospect.
bostonbruins,lxs6erl,2024-11-18 12:07:27,Not sure why you’re automatically choosing our 2 best forwards instead of the 9 other guys that have been sucking wind this season.Of course they’re not gonna replace Pasta and Marchy… it would be to see if we can get any contributions from the rest of the team.
bostonbruins,lxsmwhx,2024-11-18 13:30:10,What a tell of someone who hasn't watched a single game Lysell's played this yearNext time just don't comment
bostonbruins,lxszxyh,2024-11-18 14:35:29,One sentence in and I knew we were on the verge of losing cabin pressure
bostonbruins,lxsuf4p,2024-11-18 14:07:49,man the way this dumb fam base turns on some of their players.
bostonbruins,lxt2fn6,2024-11-18 14:48:05,"If you had. You wouldn't have this view. It's really as simple as that.During the preseason Lysell owned his minutes to the tune of a 64% xg share - and the eye test backed everything up. He was in on the forecheck. The backcheck was strong. His work keeping defenses on the backfoot with his speed gave them something to respect in this F group. He performed the best out of everyone vying for that particular job. Straight up. He got sent down anyway. Which was not the desicion but we're not going to litigate Marchand's geekie comments again. Whatever He's sent down to the AHL and hes put on a line with an absolute black hole of a hockey player in Pat Brown and a spark plug who's not exactly an offensive dynamo in Riley Duran. And he every single game sets up NHL quality scoring chances for those 2 and they buff almost every single one. Meanwhile the details of his game across the board show marked improvements: he plays the boards far better than he ever did last year he's going less hero puck (which is franchise instruction) and finding that Middle between using his world class speed and doing little things. However box score watchers kvetch about his lack of points. Ignoring that he's still tilting the ice when he's out there. And his linemates can't finish dick but he's working very well within them. But He does get dinged when he comes back his most common linemates are John Farranacci (a guy who has produced) and Merkulov. A guy who was one of seven players to score 30 last year in the AHL. And would you look at that. He starts producing? While still maintaining those aspects of his game. So to say ""it's clear"" is a preconceived notion on your part. Should he get a permanent job straight away? We don't know. But he by all metrics in each hockey he's played in this season thus far has more than earned his opportunity in the NHL. Full stop"
bostonbruins,lxsvc5q,2024-11-18 14:12:23,there are plenty of guys you can move down in this lineup.
bostonbruins,lxs4al3,2024-11-18 11:56:39,As it stands we have like 9 4th liners based on current play so ideally I’d like to give someone who can score a chance even if they don’t succeed.Regardless I was replying to someone saying he’s been better than Lysell when he has fewer points in more games.
bostonbruins,lxs5utg,2024-11-18 12:04:37,If only one of the other 9 guys currently playing like a 4th liner could fill that spot and we could bring up a young guy to see if they can produce anything.But no the team must get slower and less talented at all costs.
bostonbruins,lxs8k7h,2024-11-18 12:18:20,You'd expect the leaders to... lead.  Neither of them are in the top 40 in the league in points.  Secondary offense is great but you need primary scoring from primary guys
bostonbruins,lxt5chi,2024-11-18 15:02:48,I’ll say whatever the fuck I want good take bad take it’s all good
bostonbruins,lxt690h,2024-11-18 15:07:27,I’m sure the front office will agree with you then and call him up today.
bostonbruins,lxs6n6p,2024-11-18 12:08:39,What young guy are you bring up?
bostonbruins,lxs8x3f,2024-11-18 12:20:09,Well we're not getting it as it stands. So we can either try to get secondary offense or not get secondary offense.
bostonbruins,lxt8t49,2024-11-18 15:20:40,Sweet edit lol
bostonbruins,lxt5i15,2024-11-18 15:03:35,And that's fine if you want to be ill informed baby girl 
bostonbruins,lxt74yt,2024-11-18 15:12:01,Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. Especially considering a lot of the decisions this front office has made haven't proven to be the correct ones anyway kinda stands to reason they aren't making the right choice here either.
bostonbruins,lxs7ubl,2024-11-18 12:14:43,PoitrasLysellMcLaughlinFarinacciHell even just better vets like Lettieri or Pitlick
bostonbruins,lxsapbn,2024-11-18 12:29:05,That's my point.  We are getting secondary offense from primary scorers
bostonbruins,lxtk4i4,2024-11-18 16:17:38,Aw man you had to go and make it weird bringing your fetish into it
bostonbruins,lxt7u6i,2024-11-18 15:15:39,You should email them your resume.
bostonbruins,lxs91z5,2024-11-18 12:20:50,Calling up Poitras Lysell and Farinacci would be an awful decision. You don’t risk their development by throwing them into the fire when they are clearly not ready.
bostonbruins,lxstnwp,2024-11-18 14:04:01,And nothing from our secondary scorers. Maybe we could get secondary offense from both? That’s my point.Getting some offense from two groups > getting some offense from one group.
bostonbruins,lxs9apt,2024-11-18 12:22:03,I don't know where this idea of prospects being fine china needing bubble wrap came from. They can play a few NHL games to get a feel for things and not have it derail their entire fucking career lmao. They're professional athletes not babies.
bostonbruins,lxt0r3m,2024-11-18 14:39:35,I'd prefer or top line players play like top line players and put up top line numbers. Bottom line is coaching can't be off the hook.  They're a big part of this mess.  Dan Darrow is really on thin ice.
bostonbruins,lxs9frm,2024-11-18 12:22:45,Yeah because that’s worked out well /s lol
bostonbruins,lxqu3zw,2024-11-18 07:16:17,Not gonna lie that's a really sick mask design. Especially love the stitched letters

bostonbruins,lxrlb4l,2024-11-18 10:16:34,Friedman talked about the bruins a bit on 32 thoughts. Said the team is still trying to recover from a disjointed camp (injuries + the Sway stuff) and that the Sway negotiations have left lingering bad feelings cause of how out in the open everything was. Also said that the players know how much noise there is around the team right now and are trying to ignore it and stick together. Lastly said Sweeney is being active in the market right now.
bostonbruins,lxsbf6q,2024-11-18 12:32:42,"Per Pagnotta the bruins are searching the market for ""a power forward that can score"". I'm gonna lose my mind just get someone that can skate I'm begging"

bostonbruins,lxrlifx,2024-11-18 10:17:43,[deleted]
bostonbruins,lxt109v,2024-11-18 14:40:52,Freidman briefly mentioned Geekie while musing about the Taylor Hall scratch situation. Not like there's any smoke or anything but basically while talking about Taylor Hall being scratched he said that teams would look to give guys a change of scenery if they aren't playing and in the the last year of their contract. And he mentioned that Boston is the type of team that would look at a guy like Geekie getting moved if he was gonna be scratched so he could play. It didn't seem like there was much more to it over than using Geekie and a handful of other guys in similar situations as examples to the Hall situation. Still though Freidman isn't one to name drop if there isn't at least a tiny bit of something to it.
bostonbruins,lxtccrm,2024-11-18 15:38:42,I just looked up how some of our old friends were doing in Chicago…Craig smith seems to be faring well over there he would be tied for third on the bruins in goals right now….Been following crazy legs his whole career since I’ve lived in Nashville since 2010 and was genuinely excited when he signed and sincerely disappointed when his game fell apart. I’m happy he’s doing well in Chicago but man if a slightly rejuvenated Craig smith in 2024 is outpacing 90% of your team in goals… things are off. 
bostonbruins,lxrdocw,2024-11-18 09:32:02,The upcoming schedule is this teams chance to turn it all around
bostonbruins,lxrooh7,2024-11-18 10:35:09,Jeff Viel recalled. Jeff fucking Viel is really gonna be on our NHL roster while lysell and Poitras are both in Providence. I think I'm starting to hate this team lol.
bostonbruins,lxrom16,2024-11-18 10:34:47,Monty needs to drop this team off somewhere in the woods with a bottle of water a partially torn map a jar of PB and a jar of fluff but no bread and a single space blanket and tell them they need to find their way back to civilization in 36 hours.

bostonbruins,lxrwqnj,2024-11-18 11:18:00,Poitras and Lysell wasting away in Prov while Boston gets Jeff fucking Viel. I mean obviously I’m rooting for him to play well but what the fuck? Where are OUR forwards??????  “Wasting away” is a little strong but you know what I mean
bostonbruins,lxrx34f,2024-11-18 11:19:50,Jeffery Viel getting NHL time in 2024 is malpractice Jeffery Viel getting NHL time before a guy like Kuntar or Duran or Farranacci (or god forbid Lysell slotted higher in the lineup while you fill a lower line with a guy playing higher than his standing. You're allowed to do that you know) is jail
bostonbruins,lxr7lk9,2024-11-18 08:53:49,Was there ever an update on Kastelic? I know he wasn't at practice yesterday is he good to go for today?
bostonbruins,lxqmaey,2024-11-18 06:03:57,!habs
bostonbruins,lxtxfiz,2024-11-18 17:26:11,Lots of buzz in hockey media about a possible Hallsy trade. I think he's the last thing this team needs right now.
bostonbruins,lxs1vj5,2024-11-18 11:44:26,Talking about opportunity it doesn’t get better than what the Bruins are offering some of these players and it looks like the moment is too big for them. So do you blame the player or the front office.

bostonbruins,lxsqks3,2024-11-18 13:48:40,We've seen Poitras and McLoughlin enough to know they have some playmaking ability.  Unfortunately it seems to end there.  Neither has done anything close to deserve top 6 play.  For 3rd and 4th line they aren't penalty killers or bangers.  So why do so many people think Poitras (or Lysell who we haven't seen enough) are going to spark some scoring?  Why not give someone else a chance?  I'm not sure an AHL tough guy is the answer but what the hell.
bostonbruins,lxt39mw,2024-11-18 14:52:17,I just want to know is Monty making the lineup call up scratching decisions or is Sweeney/Neely encouraging things.

bostonbruins,lxrhnfl,2024-11-18 09:55:42,it is funny what the perception of the team is vs their record
bostonbruins,lxs3ahm,2024-11-18 11:51:34,won the way he worded it is there is a lack of ease within the team about how things were made public. not sure if swayman is holding the grudge or the organization.
bostonbruins,lxru4ti,2024-11-18 11:04:14,Bad feelings between Sway and management or Sway and the team?
bostonbruins,lxs5l55,2024-11-18 12:03:15,Anyone holding bad feelings from Swayman negotiations needs to be let go for malpractice Swayman included. If you can’t do the job with a clear mind get out.
bostonbruins,lxsf31k,2024-11-18 12:50:54,I’d be wary of trusting Pagnotta reports. He is often not accurate.
bostonbruins,lxswz0p,2024-11-18 14:20:34,How about we trade Max Jones for McDavid? That could solve some problems… /s
bostonbruins,lxtntdw,2024-11-18 16:36:19,Only names I can think of that we might be able to get would be Crouse or bertuzzi? Can’t think of any other power forward who can score that we could afford.
bostonbruins,lxrogyz,2024-11-18 10:34:00,https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/cam-neely-jeremy-swayman-64-million-reasons-bruins-contract-nhl/cam this you?
bostonbruins,lxt1h3s,2024-11-18 14:43:14,hall does some of the things that debrusk took with him when it comes to dump and chase recovery and zone entriesyou know… when he’s healthy/capable which i’m not sure he is right now.
bostonbruins,lxtgnlo,2024-11-18 16:00:13,grzelcyk would be tied for 5th in scoring on the bruins. at least they aren’t leaving the troubles up for interpretation.
bostonbruins,lxrhi7y,2024-11-18 09:54:53,you just played one of those teams you should beat and you lost in OT.

bostonbruins,lxrwtr1,2024-11-18 11:18:27,How about we leave monty out there instead
bostonbruins,lxt4lge,2024-11-18 14:59:00,Fluto breaking out the tabloid headline. I liked him better before he sold his soul to the New York Times.
bostonbruins,lxrutux,2024-11-18 11:07:56,They recalled Jeff Viel a free agent depth forward they signed this summer and buried in Providence.  So I’m guessing he’s taking Kastelic’s spot at least for tonight.

bostonbruins,lxqmb8w,2024-11-18 06:04:12,FUCK THE HABS!
bostonbruins,lxsz175,2024-11-18 14:30:53,I really don’t see how we can blame the swayman contract dispute on anything happening right now
bostonbruins,lxsxibk,2024-11-18 14:23:14,That contract wouldn't be a distraction if Swayman started stopping pucks.
bostonbruins,lxszdfg,2024-11-18 14:32:35,brother are you under the impression the first and second liners for the most part can’t possibly be moved down in the order?
bostonbruins,lxtb5bh,2024-11-18 15:32:34,Also Poitras was literally the only forward consistently tilting the lines to the bruins advantage - Poitras absolutely deserved a top 6 look based on his ability to actually put the D on the back heel in those 3rd line mins
bostonbruins,lxt73gc,2024-11-18 15:11:48,coaches don’t make callups i’m sure all 3 have a say in everything.
bostonbruins,lxrrp8i,2024-11-18 10:51:20,Speculating about other people's sobriety is fucking disgusting.
bostonbruins,lxrol7b,2024-11-18 10:34:39,hey man. fuck your stupid fucking grapevine.
bostonbruins,lxrk7b3,2024-11-18 10:10:19,they've mostly beaten bad teams and their underlying numbers say they probably should be worse then their record.
bostonbruins,lxrut9c,2024-11-18 11:07:51,My guess it’s probably both. Marchand seemed kind of annoyed when he was asked about Swayman’s contract during training camp.
bostonbruins,lxsflkr,2024-11-18 12:53:29,I know but it's also coinciding with a report from Friedman saying that Sweeney is being active in the trade market right now. So maybe a little more believable.
bostonbruins,lxtawzi,2024-11-18 15:31:23,I like Hall he’d be an upgrade on some (maybe all?) of the middle 6 guys we have rn. But part of me just really hates the idea of trading for a 33 year old with knee issues given where this team is at.
bostonbruins,lxt3iam,2024-11-18 14:53:31,Yeah I've been thinking about Hall since the off season. It would be a decent Debrusk replacement stop gap providing his knee isn't just a rickety old gate at this point which it most definitely is. Interestingly enough though his speed metrics on nhl edge are better than pretty much every bruin that isn't Kastelic and Koepke. So even with half a knee he still has more speed than the majority of the roster.
bostonbruins,lxrqc4b,2024-11-18 10:44:05,27 year old AHL tough guy we signed in the offseason probably slots in on the 4th line with Kastelic hurt
bostonbruins,lxsb8op,2024-11-18 12:31:47,Monty is on the other side of the forest with the missing piece of the map
bostonbruins,lxt6zyq,2024-11-18 15:11:18,how many times do we have to have the ‘the columnists don’t pick the headline’ conversationalso ‘sold his soul’ to take a media job in what could be the least certain time for those jobs is a bit of a stretch fam.
bostonbruins,lxqx277,2024-11-18 07:40:08,It has been 21020 days since the Leafs won the Stanley Cup. Fucking losers!
bostonbruins,lxtaqvd,2024-11-18 15:30:31,Eh I mean I can see how it could be. It’s a bit of a leap to say that’s the root of it all though
bostonbruins,lxta06v,2024-11-18 15:26:45,I truly do not understand why the idea of bringing up a Lysell instead of a plug is sacrosanct - you. Can absolutely shift Brazeau down
bostonbruins,lxryqpv,2024-11-18 11:28:25,Anybody get a screenshot of this
bostonbruins,lxrrdrt,2024-11-18 10:49:38,It’s true. They’re the NHL’s version of a .500 team but the underlying numbers are not good. -17 goal differential tells the story a bit better.
bostonbruins,lxrwf65,2024-11-18 11:16:18,because he has no say in the thinga guy going into contract negotiations is not going to have a problem with another player doing it himself. especially one who has been vocal about the league’s selfishness in the past.
bostonbruins,lxt358d,2024-11-18 14:51:40,Who available fits this definition?  If the Bruins get another Freddy type player that won't solve anything.  They don't need a big guy who can go into corners and sometimes score.  They need speed and skill
bostonbruins,lxtexul,2024-11-18 15:51:38,i’m not sure he is an upgrade at this point in his career. and I am like as low on the middle 6 guys as can be. he just isn’t the same guy anymore.
bostonbruins,lxs33b6,2024-11-18 11:50:34,finally. a move to get some snarl in the lineup over skill and speed
bostonbruins,lxt9xwp,2024-11-18 15:26:25,Fair point about the headline but Fluto has definitely moved away from in-depth hockey analysis in favor of click-baity rile-up-the-masses reportage since the Times bought the Athletic.Whether you or I would likely do the same in these uncertain times for journalists is another question entirely.
bostonbruins,lxtdyz8,2024-11-18 15:46:50,It may have altered the vibes sure but we are well past the point where the team should have worked their way outta that. This teams problems are much deeper

bostonbruins,lxu5fgy,2024-11-18 18:10:08,Game #20. At the ten-minute mark of the second period of their next game after tonight's they'll be exactly 1/4 of the way through the regular season. If the Bruins lose to this opponent on home ice after Saturday's home loss to a sub-.500 team I'll have to believe that the water that Montgomery has been treading for a while now is starting to approach the boiling point if it already hasn't. One can think of that as fair or unfair right or wrong etc. but the brutal-for-him fact is that as much as certain players might deserve it the brass can't fire the whole team.
bostonbruins,lxr2fbk,2024-11-18 08:19:21,let's fucking go! its been raining almost nonstop for weeks now and this week isn't looking any better. a win would be a much needed bright spot in all this fog.

Something I hadn’t been able to see since they moved from Ristuccia Arena. I would go there yearly for the Rookie Camps. I’m definitely trying to make my way back down there someday for another practice. The day I walked in though had missing players and sounds similar to your experience.
bostonbruins,lxoczej,2024-11-17 19:08:04,Sounds normal to me. Been to a dozen or so over the years.
bostonbruins,lxomb1t,2024-11-17 20:02:21,Thanks for sharing. How do you find out their practice schedule for days and times?
bostonbruins,lxrq0a7,2024-11-18 10:42:18,I would be more annoyed if they were joking around and playing during practice given how they've been playing so far this season

bostonbruins,lxrqm4d,2024-11-18 10:45:33,I wholeheartedly agree. Monty is doing the best job he can. Talent of the players alone doesn't get us a team that set the record for the most wins in a season. You need a good coach too. Sweeney needs to go
bostonbruins,lxs0j74,2024-11-18 11:37:38,Monty has squeezed 120% out of the roster the past couple years and is at risk of being canned for less than 100%. Though I’m not so sure who can figure it out if Monty can’t.
bostonbruins,lxo3m5l,2024-11-17 18:13:12,Damn what a weird matchup haha.
bostonbruins,lxo9cu4,2024-11-17 18:46:55,Noted tough guy David Krejci
bostonbruins,lxo2f9z,2024-11-17 18:06:13,Was going through some old photos and found these.  Got tickets last minute on a whim with a couple buds and decided we should do that sort of thing more often... Bruins won 4-3 and I'd say Krejčí won the fight
bostonbruins,lxpg77p,2024-11-17 23:13:05,I was there that night very surprised to see Krejci drop ‘em. Great career in Boston. So good with the puck & great vision.
bostonbruins,lxphw1s,2024-11-17 23:25:06,Oh man less than a month before the regular season ended due to COVID right?
bostonbruins,lxq48iy,2024-11-18 02:44:53,I miss both of these guys a lot
bostonbruins,lxqcazv,2024-11-18 04:14:35,Well fine... Guess I'm crying today DK46 
bostonbruins,lxo9oqi,2024-11-17 18:48:53,Haha yeah. I was always a big fan of Krejčí so this was cool to see
bostonbruins,lxpejng,2024-11-17 23:01:20,And I’m an anti-fan of Dallas so anytime a Bruin drops the gloves against a Star I’m all in. I’m originally from Weymouth MA and now I have to live in Dallas TX for work… and as a true hockey fan I am appalled by these fair weather local fans and their shitty corporate-driven team.
bostonbruins,lxn4nu1,2024-11-17 15:01:41,His attitude change from last season to this season has been huge. Came in excited and smiling all the time to start the seaso so much that when he started to struggle a bit Monty noticed it and told him to keep his spirits up because his smile and energy was good for the entire group. Came in this season with probably too much expectations around him for someone who hadn't played at all in months.
bostonbruins,lxo67zo,2024-11-17 18:28:30,I was there too! Can’t believe we couldn’t hold ‘em off in the third. Another OT loss in the books.
bostonbruins,lxosx7h,2024-11-17 20:42:51,I miss him!  But hoping this will be good for him.
bostonbruins,lxpl1d9,2024-11-17 23:47:54,Who that Andrew ference
bostonbruins,lxn5igf,2024-11-17 15:06:15,He’s putting in the work tho he’s the last off the ice during every warmup I’ve seen so far
bostonbruins,lxo7jal,2024-11-17 18:36:20,So stupid. They did the same thing Friday night
bostonbruins,lxoj31o,2024-11-17 19:43:04,I was there too it was a hilariously bad collapse pretty crazy… I was sitting at the end they shot at twice and still think they should have at least reviewed the play where there was a pileup in the third period from my angle it looked like it may have been poked in
bostonbruins,lxoc6z7,2024-11-17 19:03:30,He was one of the last off the ice for both games I saw in Boston this year as well.
bostonbruins,lxnfodo,2024-11-17 16:00:20,Glad to hear that hope he gets it together
bostonbruins,lxo86fa,2024-11-17 18:40:05,I know I was there for that one too! I have season tix section 121 right on the blue line. That kid Grimaldi was on fire tonight for the Monsters.
bostonbruins,lxozmu8,2024-11-17 21:24:17,From where I was it definitely poked in I just couldn’t tell if the net was already off it definitely was super close.
bostonbruins,lxnma30,2024-11-17 16:36:00,So far it has looked like the same effort in boston but against players ho won't sniff the league without injuries.
bostonbruins,lxo8xae,2024-11-17 18:44:24,I’m in 124. Season tickets as well. Were you at last Friday’s game against Bridgeport? I was the one yelling at Sweezey when he punched the glass at the end of the first. Half the bench laughed at him and he wasn’t very happy with me 
bostonbruins,lxp5ocv,2024-11-17 22:02:00,Yeah I mean they probably got it right ultimately but I was surprised it wasn’t looked at… oh well
bostonbruins,lxo9gk9,2024-11-17 18:47:32,Yes I was at that game. I’ve been to every home game but one this season. I wish I saw that though I would have been dying! 
bostonbruins,lxphdto,2024-11-17 23:21:31,I would assume they have video staff that would advise whether or not to challenge otherwise it would only be done at the officials discretion
bostonbruins,lxoa6xu,2024-11-17 18:51:50,We’ve missed 2 or 3 so far cause my son’s a goalie and had games at the same time. First year doing the full season and I’ve only seen 1 win so far . But it’s still early. The bench was dying at it but he still gives me a dirty look when he sees me now it’s hilarious. But it worked. They came out in the second and took the game over. I need to yell at them more I think.
bostonbruins,lxp06di,2024-11-17 21:27:39,Haha it’s a long season there will most definitely be some more wins! Give them hell next game hopefully they will play better 
bostonbruins,lxm7q4t,2024-11-17 12:04:20,What a fun game I was there last night! I was kind of disappointed in the Bruins Alumni roster to be completely honest but it was still a lot of fun.
bostonbruins,lxo2uwf,2024-11-17 18:08:44,How many goals did Fish score the last game?
bostonbruins,lxn1sh5,2024-11-17 14:45:55,At least these old fuckers were scoring
bostonbruins,lxnanmg,2024-11-17 15:34:03,Could you imagine Shoebottom and Milbury on the same line? lmao
bostonbruins,lxrtimp,2024-11-18 11:00:58,give yer balls a tug ! what beauties
bostonbruins,lxltbaf,2024-11-17 10:44:08,I didn't even check the score on this one I knew the Bruins were going to take 16 shots and get trounced.
bostonbruins,lxo189o,2024-11-17 17:59:23,Got this guy a fuckin Puppers
bostonbruins,lxte7jl,2024-11-18 15:48:02,Were there post-game sticks?
bostonbruins,lxn3yfc,2024-11-17 14:57:46,Where's the roster for the alum?
bostonbruins,lxr43wg,2024-11-18 08:30:50,Were the Jim's fucking beauties?
bostonbruins,lxnyjck,2024-11-17 17:43:57,Ahhh this would have been great to watch. Too bad Shoresy didn't ref half the game and just chirp the shit outta the alum! Would have been classic
bostonbruins,lxm8vg3,2024-11-17 12:10:42,Yeah I think they could of gotten a different squad of more recognizable names
bostonbruins,lxogdq4,2024-11-17 19:27:18,He had about 2-3 goals. Was pulling some good moves around the net! Delaney was there even Corey and Liam!
bostonbruins,lxn705x,2024-11-17 15:14:24,It was very laid back lol
bostonbruins,lxoggmk,2024-11-17 19:27:44,Lmao I can’t
bostonbruins,lxltsxe,2024-11-17 10:46:58,And an ozone and too much man penalties.
bostonbruins,lxtq07o,2024-11-18 16:47:23,Yeah actually it was given to the goalie who played for the Bulldogs. He is a state trooper who is a practice goalie for Boston he got the game stick.
bostonbruins,lxn6m7n,2024-11-17 15:12:18,Sorry rude of me not to include that!https://preview.redd.it/ginwsqpkri1e1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e46aa26beae23615c2fef14ac9ad96555fb7fa12
bostonbruins,lxtq2gh,2024-11-18 16:47:42,Fucking beauties all game!
bostonbruins,lxmq9n7,2024-11-17 13:44:59,Still an exciting game but paying $80 per ticket to see guys that played mostly in the minors was kind of a let down. Still turned out to be a fun game though!
bostonbruins,lxu1qxz,2024-11-18 17:49:27,Sticks are unbelievable.
bostonbruins,lxn0mgd,2024-11-17 14:39:32,I missed out on Letterkenny live because of Covid. I could have gone but didn’t want to risk it. This was more of a make up for me.
bostonbruins,lxlk4d6,2024-11-17 09:49:17,5 regulation wins in 19 games is straight up not good. Even the fucking Habs have more. The good news is the Sens Wings and Sabres all lost in regulation yesterday. As much as it hurts to say we might just be part of the mid-off with those teams this season.
bostonbruins,lxl9s1z,2024-11-17 08:38:19,"Love Lohrei.  He still has defensive issues - but that part of his game will come.  He's better every game.I was trying to avoid all of the ""fire monty"" stuff but it seems like no adjustments are being made to the game plan and other teams have totally figured out how to keep the Bruins to the outside in the offensive zone.  I also cannot figure out why they can't see that two of their goals yesterday started with simple wristers on net from the point.  Do the boys not see that they have next-to-no shots... and does that not make them at least want to throw anything at Binnington?  I would think so - so they must be getting coached to not throw everything at the net.  It's just so fucking odd.  Then after 12 minutes they flip one at the net and chaos ensues and almost leads to a goal.  Like hello?"
bostonbruins,lxm85vy,2024-11-17 12:06:46,OT sucked but watch the replay of that game. Lohrei's zone entries are phenomenal though maybe because teams havent clamped down on him yet. But he began both sequences that led to the Freddy goals. Every time Lohrei enters the zone it's electric. Plus the team was shooting on net early (Pasta 1 minute into period then Geekie 2 minutes later Zadorov 20 seconds later). Korpisalo was awesome. OT was ridiculous. But the team had the right mentality early in the game. There might be something to build on here. Hampus being out sucks but now watching what Lohrei's constant presence out there could do...could be something. Let's get ready for Monday against CBJ. Look at Korpisalo at the 2 minute time stamp here. https://youtu.be/s7QI3hQuvqE?si=kriL9WxwDnof_QJR
bostonbruins,lxldbf4,2024-11-17 09:03:44,Zadorov had probably his best game all year. He also played 3rd pair and had the least amount of 5v5 TOI of the 3 LD. Who would have thought?
bostonbruins,lxlz1tz,2024-11-17 11:16:37,Practice updates this AM:Tyler Johnson & Peeke backNo Marchand Kastelic & Tufte (sent back to Providence)
bostonbruins,lxmtf0l,2024-11-17 14:01:24,some depressing stats: https://edge.nhl.com/en/team/20242025-regular-BOSone interesting point Kastelic has the fastest recorded skating speed on the team so far this season
bostonbruins,lxnop4e,2024-11-17 16:49:13,I think Harry Sinden said something like a coach is only effective for about 3 years.  Also why is everyone trying to trade Coyle?  He's great on the PK and is noticeably faster and has more hustle this year.
bostonbruins,lxlf03k,2024-11-17 09:15:30,Would you want zegras and if so what’s the package you could part with?
bostonbruins,lxls0nv,2024-11-17 10:36:44,"People I am down to trade and could reasonably be traded for a ""shakeup"":CoyleMarchandFredericCarloGeekieI don't think a coaching change solves anything as I'm almost certain one of Leach/Kelly/Sacco become head coach and it's only slight adjustments to offensive structure. But if the team really needs to be shaken up it's a coach + a core player that needs to go."
bostonbruins,lxlcxdo,2024-11-17 09:00:59,Was not able to watch yesterdays game so when I say this I’m not talking about that just speaking more broadly: been increasingly feeling like total SOG counts have very little to do with what’s happening on the ice. I prefer when broadcasts don’t even show that number. And no this is not meant to absolve how mediocre this team has been. But when people are like “omg we had a 16 minute stretch with only 4 shots ” I’m just like okay and? Shot counts are down across the league even for good teams while scoring is up. The entire league basically except for the Carolina who always seems to be doing their own thing is stressing maximum shot quality above all else because getting inside ice and getting pucks thru is harder than it’s ever been. That and goalie analytics that suggest that giving goalies a bunch of freebies tends to enhance their performance as the game goes on. The way people react to this makes me think some of you want Claude back
bostonbruins,lxl8keq,2024-11-17 08:29:31,Today's positive thought: our offense defense and special teams are all clueless and terrible but our backup goalie may be one of the best in the league! 
bostonbruins,lxlc7go,2024-11-17 08:55:53,Monty has to go.I’m sorry to say it coach’s are always the sacrificial lamb. The fact of the matter is this team has serious talent and are playing like they do not care. They’re demoralized and it’s beyond obvious. Why the fuck was Beecher benched for yesterday’s game?
bostonbruins,lxnke0d,2024-11-17 16:25:39,What about this Blues and Islanders trade idea?- To Bruins: Faksa Topochenko Robertsson- To Blues: Frederic Jones Harrison2nd trade- To Bruins: Palmeri Wahlstrom- To Islanders: Coyle Geekie LysellNew lineup- Faksa Zacha Pasta- Marchand Lindholm Palmeri- Topochenko Poitras Brazeau- Koepke Kastelic Beecher- Wahlstrom
bostonbruins,lxlks7w,2024-11-17 09:53:28,It’s gonna be the Quenneville show
bostonbruins,lxloowi,2024-11-17 10:17:11,And look at who the opponents were in those 5 regulation wins...
bostonbruins,lxlb97l,2024-11-17 08:49:03,They are quite literally being coached to not just throw stuff on net Monty’s whole offensive philosophy is shot quality over shot quantity. Works great when he has the personnel for it and the team is playing confidently. We don’t have the personnel for it and the team is playing with as little confidence as I can ever remember.
bostonbruins,lxmq4bu,2024-11-17 13:44:13,I am always 100% into underdog stories and Korpi might be my favorite thing on this team right now for that reason
bostonbruins,lxmgop8,2024-11-17 12:54:05,Korpisalo was great not saying much but he has been better than Swayman so far this year
bostonbruins,lxlkuhl,2024-11-17 09:53:51,Him and McAvoy don’t work
bostonbruins,lxmfep1,2024-11-17 12:47:03,Peeke back is good!
bostonbruins,lxmc4ri,2024-11-17 12:28:52,Marchy being hurt would make sense with how he looked last game. If my memory is correct didn't 2 games ago he came up lame on a 1v2 rush in pain?
bostonbruins,lxlr3oq,2024-11-17 10:31:24,Yes and I'm trading Freddy +
bostonbruins,lxlht29,2024-11-17 09:34:20,If I had any faith that this organization wouldn’t Tortarella the shit out of him yes absolutely. But I just don’t see this team as it stands now ever being willing to bet on offensive upside and skill
bostonbruins,lxlw0i9,2024-11-17 10:59:39,2nd and FreddyAnaheim needs to retain halfZegras screams change of scenery type player ala Zacha.Freddy in there to make the money work2nd instead of a 3rd due to the retention (if he starts to pick it up could see a 2nd and a 4th or something). Zegras is enough of a risk based on his current play that he isn’t worth as much as people think
bostonbruins,lxlsgza,2024-11-17 10:39:19,Hes been underperforming for 2 years I wouldn't give up much for him although I do like his talent
bostonbruins,lxls487,2024-11-17 10:37:18,Marchand isn't likely to be traded.
bostonbruins,lxm98sc,2024-11-17 12:12:46,Not Coyle.
bostonbruins,lxmhcb9,2024-11-17 12:57:40,Marchand is never getting traded nor should they trade Carlotrade return value for Geekie Coyle or Frederic would be less than you think their stock is low now and you are better off keeping them and hoping they can overcome their slumps (unless you are tanking and just looking for draft picks)also expectations are too high for some of them they are not real top 2 line players on any kind of successful team
bostonbruins,lxlm203,2024-11-17 10:01:19,I get your perspective but we’re 31st in SOG/60 and 21st in xGF/60 at 5v5. Our decline in shot production can’t be solely explained by league-wide trends and our shot quality is below average; nowhere near sufficient to compensate for low shot quantity. When we’re near the bottom of the league in shot quantity and can’t even create quality chances the few times we manage a shot on goal I can understand people’s complaints.
bostonbruins,lxlezmh,2024-11-17 09:15:24,The SOG total yesterday felt pretty misleading too. There were definitely stretches where the Blues carried the play but the Bruins were also constantly firing shots wide. I say this with no idea of how many times they actually missed the net but it sure felt like a lot.
bostonbruins,lxldzbl,2024-11-17 09:08:24,While it's true that more shots doesn't automatically equal better there's a happy medium in there somewhere and the Bruins are well below that. To use a recent example 0 shots in the entire 3rd period of a tie game isn't going to get you many wins
bostonbruins,lxlvqk3,2024-11-17 10:58:04,I totally agree. Even look at how many times Carolina struggles to score too with their style. Fans get frustrated in our style but it's really that the players aren't good enough or not putting in a complete effort. Who cares what the shots on goal total is? Would it make fans feel better if we lost 3 to 2 but we had 30 shots on goal? Even 2 years ago when we broke records we were 10th in the league in shots just above the Sabres. The only reason our shots were that high was because we were super dominant. Last year we were 21 in shots on goal but still was 14th in goals and 2nd in the division.
bostonbruins,lxlo595,2024-11-17 10:13:55,Note: this is sarcasm ^
bostonbruins,lxlv38s,2024-11-17 10:54:21,Just to add a mid thought to your positive thought: the fact that DeBrusk and Heinen get brought up on this sub almost every day shows how desperate the situation is. Even when Bergy Krejci Hall left the following season wasnt this horrific as a result of their departure.
bostonbruins,lxld3a5,2024-11-17 09:02:09,Is the serious talent in the room with us now?
bostonbruins,lxlohc6,2024-11-17 10:15:55,>this team has serious talentWe have one legitimate first liner a couple of seconds and then a logjam of third and fourths that we're forced to roll out on the top two lines.Did you mean to write serious lack of talent?
bostonbruins,lxm6q3p,2024-11-17 11:58:47,Lol this team does NOT have serious talent. Beecher was benched because he hasn’t been very good lately
bostonbruins,lxm3bq9,2024-11-17 11:40:06,I'm with you. I'd fire him for the last-ranked powerplay alone.
bostonbruins,lxreel2,2024-11-18 09:36:29,Because Beecher was especially bad his last 3 gamesAs for Monty firing. Might wanna buckle up
bostonbruins,lxo5qoq,2024-11-17 18:25:42,4 4th liners plus Kyle Palmieri is not the answer. Faksa on the top line would go hard (to watch)
bostonbruins,lxlqhw9,2024-11-17 10:27:50,It’ll be Jay Leach. Not a chance management tries to hire Joel because of the PR hit they’ll take.
bostonbruins,lxlrsye,2024-11-17 10:35:30,I know man.
bostonbruins,lxllk10,2024-11-17 09:58:15,I just think Zadorov is a risky style player and the more TOI you give him especially against other teams top players the more his mistakes will hurt you. Don't get me wrong I think he can be an asset because that risky play can spark the team to get going but you have to manage it properly. 
bostonbruins,lxmdild,2024-11-17 12:36:31,Post practice Montgomery said it was a maintenance day for himBut yeah [this play](https://x.com/bearwithme_pod/status/1855439399770894546?s=46&t=YGOvDhqJQ7QrFwVGTFIrnA) from the Sens game looked like it could’ve been bad the way his knee buckled. Don’t think he ended up missing any shifts though.
bostonbruins,lxlwcxh,2024-11-17 11:01:39,Maybe add a mid level prospect in there to sweeten it
bostonbruins,lxlsr9l,2024-11-17 10:40:58,Last year of his contract team is bordering on a rebuild Modified No Trade Clause all of which are reasonable trade reasons.You don't think if Colorado came calling he wouldn't want to go play with MacKinnon?
bostonbruins,lxltd57,2024-11-17 10:44:26,But I’m talking about the complaints that don’t get any deeper than “shoot the puck!” It’s always what the dumbest guy is shouting during a powerplay until your team is shooting less than the other team and then it’s suddenly sage wisdom?
bostonbruins,lxlekx6,2024-11-17 09:12:34,What about useless shots from the point that kill o zone time? Again I’m not saying that sens game was good. But I’d rather the team attempt high danger chances and risk coming away with zero shots than do the Claude thing
bostonbruins,lxnxbwc,2024-11-17 17:37:00,I mean I'd love to have Heinen still; not because I think they'd win more games but because there would be another high-effort fundamentally sound player to watch
bostonbruins,lxld5eu,2024-11-17 09:02:33,You don’t think this team has serious talent?
bostonbruins,lxo9g2z,2024-11-17 18:47:27,A change is neededFaksa killed us (along with Topochenko) yesterday. He is similar to Mojo.  More skilled than stats indicate.Montgomery knows Faksa very well from the Dallas stars days.  Palmeri alone would be huge. The PP would be better. Palmeri is also a clutch point scorer.  The team cant stay the way it is. Cant score a damn 3rd period goal.  You cant win anything like that.
bostonbruins,lxlrez0,2024-11-17 10:33:14,He’s a 4/5 dman that’s needs a defensive defenseman next to him to cover for when he takes chances. And we’ve been deploying him on the top pair as someone that is meant to cover for McAvoy when he takes chances. Just all time dumb deployment.
bostonbruins,lxltt9y,2024-11-17 10:47:01,I do t think the bruins want to trade their captain and I do t think he wants to leave we shall see
bostonbruins,lxoo5n5,2024-11-17 20:13:36,It would be Frederic first. No NMC Contract Year Future Potential.
bostonbruins,lxlev7j,2024-11-17 09:14:32,Problem is this team is getting neither quality nor quantity. You have to have at least one of the two
bostonbruins,lxldeg7,2024-11-17 09:04:19,Not really hence my glib joke
bostonbruins,lxlehbr,2024-11-17 09:11:53,I think this team has unserious talent
bostonbruins,lxocnod,2024-11-17 19:06:07,You think after 9 years in the league that “more skill” would keep his stats afloat better
bostonbruins,lxlspvp,2024-11-17 10:40:44,Totally agree. It's wild that it took Monty this long to do it. Then add in the fact that he does it with 2 defensemen hurt is even more weird.I really hope Monty stays with it too going forward.
bostonbruins,lxlfik1,2024-11-17 09:18:59,Yes and the entire league basically is moving one way while I see a lot of fans wanting it to be 2009 again that’s all I’m saying
bostonbruins,lxldhda,2024-11-17 09:04:54,Lol ok. Did we have serious talent last year?
bostonbruins,lxlelhb,2024-11-17 09:12:40,Good for you
bostonbruins,lxoh949,2024-11-17 19:32:15,Faksa is not an ideal solution for a top 6 roleBut he has better hands offensive instincts and skating ability than Geekie.  The other option would be to add Nelson with Palmeri. But salary match would be difficult. And the Bruins would need to part with 2025 1st .... the Bruins can't trade anymore top picks.
bostonbruins,lxlfovk,2024-11-17 09:20:12,I want it to be 2011 again ha ha
bostonbruins,lxldv65,2024-11-17 09:07:35,I think we were more well balanced last year and goaltending alone banked us like 20 points
bostonbruins,lxlf4ev,2024-11-17 09:16:19,What they look serious to you rn?
bostonbruins,lxp0egi,2024-11-17 21:29:05,lol dude why would NYI a team with playoff aspirations run by Lou trade away their point leader who has an NTC for a guy who does not fill a position need who also has an NTC. Adding a 1st wouldn’t even get you this trade much less adding their *other* point leader
bostonbruins,lxlgcce,2024-11-17 09:24:35,Yeah that’s a problem
bostonbruins,lxle5s6,2024-11-17 09:09:39,Mmm…aside from goaltending what was more balanced last season?
bostonbruins,lxlf78o,2024-11-17 09:16:51,They don’t that’s exactly what I’m saying
bostonbruins,lxp1ncm,2024-11-17 21:36:51,I guess you havent been following the standings or rumorsThe Islanders are currently outside of playoff contention.  Their cap situation doesnt look great moving forward.   Nelson and Palmeri are UFAs after this season. Good chance neither is brought back.  The Bruins are not going to try to miss the playoffs. If they do... history shows that the GM (DS in this case) will be relieved of his duties.   So ...if these two vets are available.... and the Bruins need top 6 wingers. Its a match in theory.
bostonbruins,lxlod8p,2024-11-17 10:15:14,It seems that went over your head yes?
bostonbruins,lxlewy7,2024-11-17 09:14:54,Scoring and special teams. I feel like your asking me questions you already know the answers to
bostonbruins,lxlfb6i,2024-11-17 09:17:37,OK on the same page
bostonbruins,lxp5gqn,2024-11-17 22:00:38,They have the same points percentage as us a team with playoff aspirations. Imagine if they came to us and said “okay we’ll take Marchand and Beecher for a 3rd line center a 3rd line winger and a prospect who hasn’t played a single NHL game” you’d be like that’s ridiculous fuck off. And then they came back and were like “okay throw in Pastrnak and we’ll add a likely outside the top 10 pick.” Other front offices are paid to win too you know. They didn’t give 8 years to Sorokin to tear it down in year 2You’re doing the “if I stack up enough mediocre players maybe it’ll add up to a really good player” thing. That only works in video games and HF boards
bostonbruins,lxlte42,2024-11-17 10:44:35,No
bostonbruins,lxlf34c,2024-11-17 09:16:04,Well if you wanna be a douche I’ll wash it right back. It’s almost like the players cared until the playoffs actually January of last year no?
bostonbruins,lxnwxn8,2024-11-17 17:34:44,OK good
bostonbruins,lxlgb4j,2024-11-17 09:24:22,??? No I mean they won a round and took the eventual cup winner to 1 goal short of game 7. Idk man I just don’t know how you can see us adding a career 5th best defenseman from 5 different teams and the 4th or 5th middle 6 center to this team and go “omg the sheer talent” by comparison. E. Lindholm and Zadorov have only been disappointing if this is your first year paying attention to E. Lindholm and Zadorov

bostonbruins,lxho6ao,2024-11-16 15:58:04,4-2-2 so far this month with an opportunity to go on a run here with the next 3 opponents.I too am growing tired of trying to stay positive but im trying to keep the train moving.See you guys monday night
bostonbruins,lxhrqsb,2024-11-16 16:17:34,Couple of thoughts on this afternoon's game: - A lot of people are questioning the OT lines. Here's why I'm torn on that: Montgomery *did* put out top six players first in OT. The team didn't start with Coyle Frederic and Oesterle. Secondly before OT Frederic and Oesterle were actually...two of the best players in the game. Obviously it didn't work out but I *don't* hate the idea of throwing out two of the guys that have actually produced including the Bs only goal scorer of the game. - Brought it up in the game thread but that is the second time in this recent stretch where the Bruins have relied on either Swayman (Ottawa) or Korpisalo (Blues) to steal them a point because of bad third period play. That's not sustainable especially because this is happening against teams out of the playoff picture. That being said I'm happy that both those points were stolen because even though it's not nearly as good as getting two – those OT points do matter at the end of the day for playoffs. - The absence of Hampus is much felt even just in these first few games.
bostonbruins,lxhrivg,2024-11-16 16:16:19,Remember way back on Tuesday night when the Bruins were clutch and grabbed an incredible comeback victory and we thought they'd turned the season around? Ah the good old days
bostonbruins,lxhvtz1,2024-11-16 16:39:58,one problem is the guy who was supposed to be our first line center lost the job to a third line winger - not the only problem but a big one

bostonbruins,lxhpt4m,2024-11-16 16:06:57,No offensive output by our top 6 doesn’t bode well for a win. Lucky to get the point
bostonbruins,lxho1e9,2024-11-16 15:57:20,"there are games where after an OT loss I can say ""well at least we got a point""this isn't one of 'em we should have had that oneoofstill keeping the faith still believe we're gonna see a turnaround; just that was tough"
bostonbruins,lxhults,2024-11-16 16:33:14,At least Kastelic is only “day to day” with his injury
bostonbruins,lxhqp7j,2024-11-16 16:11:49,Turns out having a top 6 who can't score is a serious weakness in the NHL...who knew
bostonbruins,lxibc19,2024-11-16 18:09:09,shooting the puck is the most enjoyable part about playing hockey… are these guys allergic to having *fun*?

bostonbruins,lxhqjql,2024-11-16 16:10:59,17 SOG is not a recipe for success
bostonbruins,lxhrqh3,2024-11-16 16:17:31,Was at the game. During pregame warmup it didn't even look like anyone wanted to be there. This team is broken.
bostonbruins,lxhmzxu,2024-11-16 15:51:45,Boneheaded play by Oesterle. Absolutely cannot make that play in OT.
bostonbruins,lxhyiso,2024-11-16 16:54:50,The Bruins haven’t scored a third period goal at home in 9 games.
bostonbruins,lxhnlvt,2024-11-16 15:55:01,Frederic looked lost in OT
bostonbruins,lxhw7kg,2024-11-16 16:42:00,Absolutely zero chemistry up and down the lineup. Whole OT period looked like the team had never spent a second together on the ice. My guess is management stressed a different play style after the last two playoffs and you have a coach and roster playing in-between a tweaked system with bad communication. Whole group looks lost.
bostonbruins,lxi2az2,2024-11-16 17:15:50,Guys I think I’ve learned something so far this season.You have to actually shoot the black thing at the net thing to win games
bostonbruins,lxi7lve,2024-11-16 17:46:23,#BringBackHall I miss him. He played 3rd line minutes for this team and he worked his ass off. He could help us with depth scoring
bostonbruins,lxhny4n,2024-11-16 15:56:50,Slow.  We skate slow we pass slow we play slow.  Forwards just blow past our d-men because they're just standing there not moving their feet.  Monty is certainly not without blame.  But this starts at the top.  We have refused to adapt to the changing NHL choosing instead to stubbornly cling to a hard hitting bruising style of hockey that was becoming obsolete the last time we won the cup.  The future for the Bruins needs to be a rebuild.  We need to try to catch up before the whole league passes us by.
bostonbruins,lxhoxwi,2024-11-16 16:02:14,Fredi  stepped up today but people like Elias Lindholm are no shows and should be held accountable. The shots on goal is beyond embarrassing. If I had a dollar for every missed shot they took 
bostonbruins,lxi3pfc,2024-11-16 17:23:47,The Bruins are averaging 5.6 shots per third period at home this year.
bostonbruins,lxiaqfg,2024-11-16 18:05:24,Bruins are struggling against quality competition...low or high quality

bostonbruins,lxhq3e5,2024-11-16 16:08:30,Embarrassing…I hold my liquor better than they hold a lead.
bostonbruins,lxhnoy8,2024-11-16 15:55:29,Fredrick skating in circles in ot ..osterlea what the hell? I don't think anyone on this team gives a shit.
bostonbruins,lxhwgw3,2024-11-16 16:43:28,The sheer apathy that I'm seeing from this team is alarming tbh. 
bostonbruins,lxj48im,2024-11-16 21:09:55,Hope we get better getting a little worried
bostonbruins,lxhnbiu,2024-11-16 15:53:27,Sickening loss because the Bruins were in this one and needed that point. With an effort like that I'm looking forward to next game hoping they build on that. Freddy Lohrei Korpi stood out.
bostonbruins,lxhn4pc,2024-11-16 15:52:27,I remember in the offseason when we heard that “we need to get faster and more offensive” but instead Sweeney made the team slower and forget that offense exists
bostonbruins,lxhxcf1,2024-11-16 16:48:20,they're so bad you just have to laughcan't hold a lead against a terrible blues team the bruins are unwatchable
bostonbruins,lxiug0n,2024-11-16 20:07:40,At this point I just want to see the Bruins look like they care. If they're only pretending to care as long as they fool me into thinking they actually DO care that's fine
bostonbruins,lxj5n51,2024-11-16 21:19:11,hard to blame the coach overall but when you get too many men on the ice penalties and when you play Oesterle Coyle Frederic as a line in overtime you can kind of blame the coaching
bostonbruins,lxhnj2m,2024-11-16 15:54:35,Why doesn't this team have a shot mentality? 17 shots?! Really?!SHOOT THE FUCKING PUCK!
bostonbruins,lxhnlgr,2024-11-16 15:54:57,We’ve got a major skill issue
bostonbruins,lxisvyd,2024-11-16 19:57:49,Here's Scott Seiss of Cocaine Bear fame venting some frustration. https://youtu.be/Y-YC3jUV-O4?si=6XOWSg07af5aKtpaThis team needs an identity. If they suck then at least make it fun. What are they gonna do? Be miserable until April? It's the weirdest mix of players. When Kastelic gets back give him and his line top line minutes. Zacha's line they get 4th line minutes. Middle 6 is a disaster so try every stupid combination possible with them.Lohrei's minutes have gone up since Hampus is out and he drives every play. Put him on top pair just for his offense. What's the worst that would happen? They'd suck? Monty's job would be in jeopardy but its not like he's not in the hot seat already.
bostonbruins,lxjz653,2024-11-17 00:54:32,Honestly wonder if they got snakebit with the first week having two rowdy games against Florida.
bostonbruins,lxlmma6,2024-11-17 10:04:42,I really don’t know at this point.
bostonbruins,lxhpgwl,2024-11-16 16:05:07,A opportunity to get 2 points and they fucking blew it.
bostonbruins,lxho02f,2024-11-16 15:57:08,The thing is even when we win we look like hot garbage
bostonbruins,lxhnt1a,2024-11-16 15:56:05,There are a lot of issues that have nothing to do with Monty on this team but time is up at this point. Can't continue to have third periods where nothing happens and trying to hold onto 1 goal leads for 30 minutes and be successful.
bostonbruins,lxhoc2u,2024-11-16 15:58:57,I think perhaps this team doesn't want Monty to be their coach any more. And the feeling is mutual. I'm just not seeing people playing hard for each other
bostonbruins,lxhmzam,2024-11-16 15:51:39,Can we fire Sweeney and Neely now?
bostonbruins,lxhnqb4,2024-11-16 15:55:41,Another nail in the coffin for Monty unfortunately..
bostonbruins,lxhndxb,2024-11-16 15:53:49,Well once again you can't win if you don't shoot the fucking puck.

bostonbruins,lxi4aof,2024-11-16 17:27:12,I got home just in time to tune in to the last ten minutes of the third period and managed to watch Oesterle make three fucking bonehead plays in that timespan.Do we seriously not have any better options than this dildo?
bostonbruins,lxhnejn,2024-11-16 15:53:55,That face on Jaffe says it all
bostonbruins,lxhop2k,2024-11-16 16:00:55,Not a good team. Definitely not a fun team to watch. Game after game with minimal shots having no ice and giving the other team lots of ice.
bostonbruins,lxhooyl,2024-11-16 16:00:54,I mean I’m all for staying positive but there’s enough of a sample size here. We fucking blow. And the worst part is we’re in the mid tier of blow so it’s even more painful. I hate it here.
bostonbruins,lxhn1ci,2024-11-16 15:51:57,Oesterle in OT? Bye Monty
bostonbruins,lxhnciz,2024-11-16 15:53:37,We haven’t scored a ppg in 6 games. The only thing that would make up for their anemic offense is a good power play and it’s DEAD FREAKING LAST!!!!! It sucks ass!
bostonbruins,lxhog1d,2024-11-16 15:59:33,Hypothetically if Monty goes who replaces him?
bostonbruins,lxhonqw,2024-11-16 16:00:43,I really wish I knew what was going on. The boys look tired. They look like they stayed up too late the night before. They look like they got into my special stash before games. I know regression is a thing. But this is bad.
bostonbruins,lxhttaf,2024-11-16 16:28:52,This team is in 3rd place?! Is the Atlantic the worst division in the history of sports?
bostonbruins,lxhnxma,2024-11-16 15:56:46,Fucking downvote if you want but if Monty can’t get this team to wake up and play decent on home ice again a bad team after that embarrassing stars loss then get rid of him.
bostonbruins,lxi5d5z,2024-11-16 17:33:23,I’m no sport psychologist but when I compete in jiu jitsu I get fired up when my coach screams and shows some passion towards my match. Monty is so flat no?? His mumbling wouldnt light a fire in me. I bet it’s similar in hockey.
bostonbruins,lxhmvnr,2024-11-16 15:51:07,I 3-2 dislike when the Bruins lose.
bostonbruins,lxi4w3i,2024-11-16 17:30:38,Am I correct that the Bruins have 0 regulation wins against good teams?
bostonbruins,lxhot7m,2024-11-16 16:01:31,I see losing in overtime is becoming a problem again…

bostonbruins,lxij702,2024-11-16 18:58:14,At this point I want them to try anything.  We could probably pick up Phill Kessel cheap.  Any chance Jagr would come back?  Anything please.  Make everyone shoot with the opposite hand just shoot.  Anything.
bostonbruins,lxhmyzz,2024-11-16 15:51:36,Classic 2024 Bruins
bostonbruins,lxhsj5p,2024-11-16 16:21:52,Montgomery should be gone by Monday
bostonbruins,lxjidp3,2024-11-16 22:44:30,We've got plenty of issues all around. Our best players have been who? Pasta Hampus and Korpi? Pasta is definitely our best forward and he's still having a down year so that's some sort of greater than 0% good sign.Hampus is better than last year but not as good as the god season and he's gone so I'd expect him to be worse than last year when he does get backKorpi has been a pleasant surprise (Shout out goalie Bob) but in terms of goaltending I think we need to keep giving Sway the starts so he gets used to it and finds his gameThis is the same team as last year minus Debrusk Forbort and Ullmark of players who make a significant impact. Replaced by Zadorov (should be better than Forbort) and Lindholm (equal or greater value than DeBrusk)We've needed another top 6 player for a few years (minus 2022-23) and signing Lindholm doesn't count when it subtracts DeBrusk. But with the team being extremely similar I do think this is the time to fire Montgomery (personally I'd go with Gerard Gallant as the next coach).  Blame should be spread amongst a lot of spots though. Players should be performing better Monty should be coaching better and Sweeney should idk actually add a top 6 forward to the group? It's certainly a mess of a season but still a long way to go. Can't trad the whole team and Sweeney isn't getting fired right now so time for a new voice
bostonbruins,lxhndsl,2024-11-16 15:53:48,It’s Montgover
bostonbruins,lxhp3s9,2024-11-16 16:03:07,Hypothetically the team sells. Who gets tossed?
bostonbruins,lxhzphw,2024-11-16 17:01:20,I'm not surprised I'm actually appreciating this type of consistency.
bostonbruins,lxhn1nh,2024-11-16 15:52:00,Who would have thought years of drafting no talent would cause the team to be mid.
bostonbruins,lxi0s94,2024-11-16 17:07:19,Please fire the coach. Montgomery has clearly lost them. He was a good coach but to stay with him now just because he had two good regular seasons is stupid. It is clear the team is directionless with him at the helm
bostonbruins,lxhmxzd,2024-11-16 15:51:27,Oof.
bostonbruins,lxho486,2024-11-16 15:57:45,This just isn’t a good team unfortunately. I’d say we should be sellers at the deadline but all the NMCs will stop that so we’re just stuck in this weird purgatory for the foreseeable future.
bostonbruins,lxhpmxt,2024-11-16 16:06:01,The bruins now haven’t scored more than 3 regulation goals in a month. Goals scored over the last ten games: 0 2 3 2 0 4 2 3 2 2. Goal differential (which is an incredibly accurate predictor of final standings): 4th last in the league. Worse than the Ducks Blue Jackets Blackhawks Red Wings Sabres and Flyers. This team will finish bottom 10 or even bottom 5 if this keeps up that’s not hyperbole
bostonbruins,lxhmxte,2024-11-16 15:51:25,Time to start betting against this team. I'll either start enjoying the games or make a ton.
bostonbruins,lxhn0q5,2024-11-16 15:51:52,Burn it down. Burn it all down.This team is toothless

bostonbruins,lxho7c4,2024-11-16 15:58:14,They should of lost my 5 goals this team blows

bostonbruins,lxiu1np,2024-11-16 20:05:07,Just remember he sucked with Buffalo before we traded for him. He has offensive prowess more than most of the team. Pasta may need a playmaker and we see that with Hall. It’s a chance I’m willing to take

bostonbruins,lxhp879,2024-11-16 16:03:47,> The future for the Bruins needs to be a rebuild We have a ton of MNCs and a lot of free agents that we just signed because the front office who Charlie Jacobs has reiterated he has full confidence in wanted to get big. That is not happening.
bostonbruins,lxi0tb3,2024-11-16 17:07:29,Coming from a Flames fan Lindholm is an overrated player who needs complimentary players. He can't drive play
bostonbruins,lxhphg5,2024-11-16 16:05:11,> If I had a dollar for every missed shot they took That wasn't the issue. The issue was they didn't take enough shots.
bostonbruins,lxi9zsh,2024-11-16 18:00:45,I think if they keep working at it they can get below 5
bostonbruins,lxhqdn0,2024-11-16 16:10:04,weird line to have out there in OT anyways
bostonbruins,lxi0hv1,2024-11-16 17:05:42,It could be a sign that they are over Monty. Grasping at straws here but it’s night and day between this year and last. They know and he knows. Monty in the postgame even took shots and I imagine he’s lost the room
bostonbruins,lxhnip0,2024-11-16 15:54:31,From the available free agents who did you want them to sign?
bostonbruins,lxjdt7n,2024-11-16 22:13:35,>At this point I just want to see the Bruins look like they careI am 1000% with you on this. Our biggest problem this season and frankly last playoffs too is the boys go out on the ice like they somehow give less than 0 shits about the game. The last game against St Louis was the first time I saw a pulse from this team what happened to that?
bostonbruins,lxj7wo9,2024-11-16 21:34:10,I think you nailed it they just look uninterested in playing
bostonbruins,lxkq7s5,2024-11-17 05:36:43,yeah that OT line was like WTF??  Maybe Freddy because he scored both goals - maybe.  But Osterle?
bostonbruins,lxjk2i6,2024-11-16 22:56:08,I stand behind my prediction: Monty rode a high off Bergeron and has now lost the locker room he never had. He’ll get fired in the next few months stans of him will whine before the Bruins catch fire.Book it.
bostonbruins,lxhoz4h,2024-11-16 16:02:24,2 shots in the 2nd. Ridicufuckingulous.
bostonbruins,lxhprre,2024-11-16 16:06:44,There is a team skating on the TD Garden ice. They are wearing Bruins sweaters. They do not play like an NHL level team though.
bostonbruins,lxhofrt,2024-11-16 15:59:31,I don't even think he's the problem but the team obviously needs a wakeup call and the coach is the easiest to change.
bostonbruins,lxhtpsj,2024-11-16 16:28:20,This team is a bunch of babies how many good coaches need to be ran out before they realize the players are the problem? They’re a soft group and it’s not going to change
bostonbruins,lxhpmjx,2024-11-16 16:05:58,Monty seems equally done with the players and for good reason
bostonbruins,lxi4n6z,2024-11-16 17:29:14,Guess not since we're without Peeke and Lindholm
bostonbruins,lxhplvh,2024-11-16 16:05:51,St Louis has an Asst. Coach with some experience.Jk... Kind of.
bostonbruins,lxn7hj1,2024-11-17 15:16:59,Bergeron  He was a great coach his last year
bostonbruins,lxhpgnj,2024-11-16 16:05:04,Chris Kelly interim coach that works so well they keep him ala Joe Mazzulla?
bostonbruins,lxhpl0e,2024-11-16 16:05:43,Probably Leach. And it’s a matter of when not if IMO.
bostonbruins,lxi5siu,2024-11-16 17:35:53,There aren't a ton of good options. My guess would be an internal promotion to interim like Leach or Sacco possibly Kelly. Then there are the wildcards someone like Clode Todd McClellan or even Quenneville though I would guess they'd shy away from Q given his history.
bostonbruins,lxhs6e5,2024-11-16 16:19:55,They have  Jay leech and sacco as assistants one of them would probably get a chance unless they go outside
bostonbruins,lxhv4yt,2024-11-16 16:36:06,More gamers played.  Based on point % Tampa is top 3 in the division and teams like Ottawa and NYI are in better position for a wildcard.  Hell right now we’re basically the Buffalo Sabres except they actually have a + goal difference and we’re -17!!
bostonbruins,lxhuboa,2024-11-16 16:31:40,Part of it is that we have a few games in hand now but the Atlantic and even the overall Eastern Conference is very tight together. No one's running away with anything as of yet.
bostonbruins,lxho8ll,2024-11-16 15:58:25,At what point is it on the players — and especially Marchand McAvoy and Pastrnak — for flat out refusing to wake up?
bostonbruins,lxifzw1,2024-11-16 18:38:25,Mazzulla?
bostonbruins,lxi8tu2,2024-11-16 17:53:37,Cassidy yelled at them and ended up getting fired because of that and won cup later lmao  I don’t know how Monty screaming is going help a team that has a flawed roster
bostonbruins,lxiidm1,2024-11-16 18:53:11,There's talent but no passion.

bostonbruins,lxiju43,2024-11-16 19:02:10,Best I can do is Lee Stempniak.
bostonbruins,lxikic6,2024-11-16 19:06:19,Phil Kessel hasn’t played hockey in a year IIRC.
bostonbruins,lxhsw3f,2024-11-16 16:23:48,The team plays like that's exactly what they want
bostonbruins,lxl60bw,2024-11-17 08:09:54,There was a lot of roster movement from last year definitely not the same team.Ullmark Debrusk Heinen Forbort JVR Lauko Grzelcyk Shattenkirk & Boqvist That’s a ton of turnover just from a pure chemistry standpoint.
bostonbruins,lxk6aw5,2024-11-17 01:59:23,You're missing Heinen which I think left a significant gap.
bostonbruins,lxhpf92,2024-11-16 16:04:51,"Imo you play like this anyone's up for grabs.. No ones played well enough to be ""safe"""
bostonbruins,lxhtmks,2024-11-16 16:27:51,Anyone that doesn’t have a NMC. People want to fire Montgomery so quickly but I wouldn’t be beyond trading anyone but Swayman or Pasta at this point. This team isn’t working.
bostonbruins,lxhoick,2024-11-16 15:59:54,I do think there’s a lot of talent that’s just not showing up right now. A coaching change (might happen) or leadership change (won’t happen) might spark that. It also is tricky because the Atlantic is pretty tight right now; a lot of teams are underperforming. If there’s any chance at even a WC spot GMs won’t sell.
bostonbruins,lxhqwf5,2024-11-16 16:12:55,I’m not sure what caused the downvote. You’re just pointing out reality. It’s just been gut punch after gut punch this year. Can they turn it around? Sure. Have they given me any reason to believe that they will? Hell no.
bostonbruins,lxhydnk,2024-11-16 16:54:02,Ding!
bostonbruins,lxi8cqa,2024-11-16 17:50:47,So you’re trading all the guys actually playing well and letting the stars stay…cool message.
bostonbruins,lxhod4r,2024-11-16 15:59:06,*should have
bostonbruins,lxhq7tj,2024-11-16 16:09:12,Korpisalo kept them in the game too bad he missed one in OT he deserved a W
bostonbruins,lxhyw47,2024-11-16 16:56:51,
bostonbruins,lxiqmo0,2024-11-16 19:43:55,Either way you can’t have one fun part without doing the other fun part. So…yeah there’s no other logical conclusion to draw: This team is unfortunately allergic to fun. It would also appear that this allergy is transmissible because I definitely have caught it.
bostonbruins,lxlja8h,2024-11-17 09:43:57,Well maybe the guy should start drinking again it might cure his fun allergy?
bostonbruins,lxq3bol,2024-11-18 02:35:03,I mean to be fair he had two goals this game but yea mostly I agree
bostonbruins,lxi3r3y,2024-11-16 17:24:03,Source: Someone other than Montgomery 
bostonbruins,lxhph0y,2024-11-16 16:05:08,Then we will continue to spiral until the right person gets fired.
bostonbruins,lxhshbu,2024-11-16 16:21:35,It’s looking pretty bleak for the next few years.
bostonbruins,lxi8x2a,2024-11-16 17:54:10,Yup. He's a passenger.
bostonbruins,lxhx6yr,2024-11-16 16:47:30,But missed shots become an issue when you take too few shots
bostonbruins,lxi3j91,2024-11-16 17:22:48,Oh absolutely 
bostonbruins,lxld4i3,2024-11-17 09:02:22,If you watch Behind the B they hardly show locker room shots and when they do it’s Monty giving some canned speech. Very different vibe than previous years. I think marchy and pasta must know they are on the verge of a rebuild and know they’re gonna suck for a while.
bostonbruins,lxhq34m,2024-11-16 16:08:28,They could have used the money spent on Tufte Jones and Johnson to try to keep Heinen at least. DeBrusk is also a big upgrade over any of their acquisitions though it would have been harder to find the money to keep him especially with the contract Swayman ended up getting.
bostonbruins,lxhtjus,2024-11-16 16:27:27,In addition to what u/TonyDP2128 discussed re: DeBrusk and Heinen (as well as how money *was* spent on Tufte Jones Johnson) I'd also point out that there were some better free agents. We weren't going to land Stamkos or Marchessault but Teravainen was an option. Toffoli another.
bostonbruins,lxhwpes,2024-11-16 16:44:47,Monahan. Kid can shoot skilled puck carrier.
bostonbruins,lxhnlzs,2024-11-16 15:55:02,Someone that wasn’t slow as shit
bostonbruins,lxjm2re,2024-11-16 23:10:42,he was horrible as a coach in the playoffs I think patience has to be wearing thin and I agree with you when the entire team is way underperforming there isn't much else you can do
bostonbruins,lxhqars,2024-11-16 16:09:38,WTF is with this team? They had these same issues in the playoffs last season.LET IT RIP!!!

bostonbruins,lxi5uji,2024-11-16 17:36:13,The frustrating thing is we're just going to make an idiot like McAvoy the next captain and the dressing room is still going to be soft.
bostonbruins,lxhq749,2024-11-16 16:09:05,That's what I'm saying yes
bostonbruins,lxhps89,2024-11-16 16:06:49,Need Monty to have a sex scandal then like Ime Udoka 
bostonbruins,lxhw8yx,2024-11-16 16:42:13,Games in hand is a part of it but the Atlantic is much closer than points percentage suggests especially Ottawa and Buffalo. There are a LOT of teams losing winnable games.
bostonbruins,lxhwo8d,2024-11-16 16:44:36,I was kidding but also the Bruins don't even look like a 3rd place team
bostonbruins,lxhq207,2024-11-16 16:08:17,It’s both. The players are playing like asshole and the coach is clearly failing to motivate and instill confidence in them. Can’t overhaul the roster so a coaching change is about all they can do.
bostonbruins,lxhol1z,2024-11-16 16:00:18,At what point doesn't that even matter?
bostonbruins,lxiaexn,2024-11-16 18:03:23,Monty also yells a lot despite whatever people say about him being a pure players coach. I agree; don’t think yelling is the issue.
bostonbruins,lxiajsz,2024-11-16 18:04:15,Although I’ll also add that “fired because of that” overstates the case there were a *lot* of very real coaching issues with Cassidy that he didn’t repeat with Vegas and that have a lot of overlap with Montgomery for fan frustration.
bostonbruins,lxiz4hj,2024-11-16 20:37:11,Worth a shot at this point.
bostonbruins,lxiur8g,2024-11-16 20:09:38,You’re correct. He hasn’t played since the 2022-2023 season. Somehow hasn’t retired yet though.
bostonbruins,lxizb7s,2024-11-16 20:38:21,Officially he's an unrestricted free agent.
bostonbruins,lxix6ry,2024-11-16 20:25:05,couldn't do worse than what we've been seeing
bostonbruins,lxhpkx3,2024-11-16 16:05:42,You're not trading McAvoy Swayman Pasta anyone with a NMC.
bostonbruins,lxhwwzy,2024-11-16 16:45:58,> Anyone that doesn’t have a NMC. >> I wouldn’t be beyond trading anyone but Swayman or Pasta at this point.McAvoy Lindholm Lindholm and Zadorov also have full NMCs so that's something to keep in mind. Didn't even count the guys with partial NTCs.
bostonbruins,lxhrex7,2024-11-16 16:15:43,The guy who was supposed to be dogshit is literally saving our ass. Whatever Goalie Bob does works.
bostonbruins,lxirm3n,2024-11-16 19:49:57,You and me both. 
bostonbruins,lxic7w0,2024-11-16 18:14:42,His system is quality over quantity and that’s not working anymore
bostonbruins,lxiao87,2024-11-16 18:05:01,Montgomery has said over and over that the Bruins need to shoot more. He’s called out the whole team and individual players. He’s not telling them not to shoot.
bostonbruins,lxhtonn,2024-11-16 16:28:10,Nah I do think that getting more out of the talent that we do have does a lot for the team. We're actually very young. I don't think it's sky is falling territory yet.
bostonbruins,lxie65c,2024-11-16 18:26:54,100% He always was lol IMO. Dude can sometimes be labeled as a 3C during cold streches of play no joke.
bostonbruins,lxka9ky,2024-11-17 02:40:18,Said this before if Sweens isn't looking for a new HC right now Jacobs better be looking for a new GM.
bostonbruins,lxhsak6,2024-11-16 16:20:34,No? Monty is a dead man walking.
bostonbruins,lxhww3p,2024-11-16 16:45:50,True but only Montreal Pittsburgh and San Jose have a worse goal differential right now.  That’s a bad sign you know along with losing in OT to a bad St Louis team…getting their doors blown off when playing anyone good
bostonbruins,lxhqik9,2024-11-16 16:10:48,I don't even disagree that a midseason coaching change can spark a fire/boost in an underperforming team. My big issues with it are: - Does this really address the biggest issues on the roster which are lack of speed and scoring skill? - Who is this front office going to get as the next head coach? Odds are high that it would be either a Sacco/Leach promotion (and I think they're part of the problem especially with how bad special teams have been) or worse Quenneville.
bostonbruins,lxhoz5s,2024-11-16 16:02:25,Never? Because that’s a much bigger overall problem
bostonbruins,lxjy8uv,2024-11-17 00:46:58,He did go through a PTO with Vancouver last year so it may be less than a year. Though he didn’t get signed so it’s been over a year in game time.
bostonbruins,lxhpsja,2024-11-16 16:06:52,"Yes technically you can't..  I'm just saying there's not really anyone who we can trade you'd sit back and go ""he's played well enough to stay.."""
bostonbruins,lxhqh6l,2024-11-16 16:10:36,On paper yes. But if the buyer is a legitimate contender...
bostonbruins,lxhy2xk,2024-11-16 16:52:23,Zadorov having a full NMC makes me sad
bostonbruins,lxijpiy,2024-11-16 19:01:23,Shoot the fucking puck is something I’ve been yelling at my tv for more than a decade. It’s not a Monty issue it’s a culture issue.
bostonbruins,lxis2bu,2024-11-16 19:52:44,"Yeah. I remember I drafted him in fantasy in 2022 after he had his 42 goal season. I would watch Calgary pretty often and always try to pay attention to him to see what was going on with him being so lackluster on the scoresheet. I would text my buddy like ""I fucking hate Lindholm! He is somehow just always away from the play!"" Like he would be on the top line and somehow just never seem to be in the play. Sometimes you were like is he even out there? This stint with the Bruins so far has been my biggest apprehensions realized."
bostonbruins,lxhpgj6,2024-11-16 16:05:03,"Point is what's the value of keeping Monty? I wasn't quick to jump on the ""fire Monty"" train and I'm not sure I'm on it now but I can see why people are"
bostonbruins,lxhqop2,2024-11-16 16:11:44,If the buyer is a legitimate contender and the player in question has a full NMC the return will be deeply mediocre. Patrick Kane Noah Hanifin even the offseason Matthew Tkachuk trades for example.
bostonbruins,lxhppp1,2024-11-16 16:06:26,Well for me personally a lot of it is not wanting this front office in charge of a mid-season coaching search. I think that it's highly likely we end up with either a Leach/Sacco promotion (and I think they're part of the problem) or worse the front office decides to go get Quenneville.
bostonbruins,lxi3t7u,2024-11-16 17:24:24,I'm not suggesting it. I'm just objecting to the belief that an NMC guarantees no movement. They have been waived in the past and will be waived in the future.
bostonbruins,lxhq22o,2024-11-16 16:08:18,That is a very good point tbh
bostonbruins,lxiatnx,2024-11-16 18:05:59,True but it’s rarer than you might think and usually forces a pretty mediocre return. Hence the examples.
bostonbruins,lxjc7et,2024-11-16 22:02:46,Got the bad part right.
bostonbruins,lxmbjse,2024-11-17 12:25:37,I think it just says Bad Bruins right now.

bostonbruins,lxgwwuq,2024-11-16 13:30:59,I cannot describe in words how much I hate St. Louis. I actually saw them play when I was there for Nationals this past spring and I hated them the entire time (but they gave out free hats so the puck bunny in me won).I only started watching hockey in like the 2015 ish season so I don’t really care about the Habs and I don’t even hate the Leafs that much because we always own them and they don’t usually try to cheap shot our players at least as much as the Panthers who are probably the #2 op. But I fucking fucking fucking *HATE* St. Louis and specifically Binnington. He’s just such a whiny little douche. Hardly even celebrated when he won the Cup. Thought he was hot shit that 2019 series because the refs were giving them the game to the extent that even r/hockey was on our side. I will never stop hating the Blues until Binnington is gone.https://preview.redd.it/9xq8cs9l4b1e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db8be5a18b87120742b5b694af3e149525bacb98

bostonbruins,lxh1hgm,2024-11-16 13:55:12,I find it bizarre when people talk shit about Lohrei. Though it could be because he's a defenseman struggling on defense. But offensively he's always a presence. He had the assist on 2nd Freddy goal today. Last game he created that Freddy assist to Coyle. The game before that he was smothered in coverage and still made an insane pass to Pastrnak near the net. His reach with the stick and how he only needs 2 strides to get across the width of the ice makes him one of the funnest players to watch in the NHL.

bostonbruins,lxh1psl,2024-11-16 13:56:26,JOOOOOOONAAAAAAASSSSSS
bostonbruins,lxh8e8h,2024-11-16 14:32:06,Korpi bailing out the boys this period.  Marchy needs to just clear the fucking puck there.
bostonbruins,lxhlmun,2024-11-16 15:44:19,Concerning: that is twice in the last 7 (?) games where either Swayman or Korpisalo have had to steal at least one OT point because of a terrible third period. Against teams that aren’t in the playoff picture both times.
bostonbruins,lxhlpf8,2024-11-16 15:44:43,I've cracked the code guys ..  Bruins have been bad since Sophia went on indefinite leave..
bostonbruins,lxhmi05,2024-11-16 15:49:02,Alright I have to imagine Montgomery is gone by Monday.
bostonbruins,lxhmkkz,2024-11-16 15:49:25,At least we got a point….. it’s like they were not even trying towards the end of that…
bostonbruins,lxgv6v0,2024-11-16 13:21:52,Korpi you beautiful bastard!
bostonbruins,lxh1o86,2024-11-16 13:56:13,Monty has been playing Oesterle up with McAvoy instead of Zadorov and I'm all for it. Oesterle is playing very smart with it. 
bostonbruins,lxgp369,2024-11-16 12:49:29,Good afternoon Bruins faithful - back on track today
bostonbruins,lxgulhc,2024-11-16 13:18:42,Restart the game plz we weren’t ready it doesn’t count
bostonbruins,lxgva92,2024-11-16 13:22:24,I like to see Freddy aggressive with the shots.  Had a nice feed to Coyle in the earlier matchup with St Lou.  Here’s hoping he shakes off that early season dust.
bostonbruins,lxgvbur,2024-11-16 13:22:38,Oh my goodness I am navigating the housing market for a home rental in Maine rn - and it so confusing  Someone hand me a  please

bostonbruins,lxgw2vv,2024-11-16 13:26:37,Wohoo 
bostonbruins,lxgwcqx,2024-11-16 13:28:03,Merk's pass on the replay looked even more impressive. Now he needs a goal.
bostonbruins,lxgwdxt,2024-11-16 13:28:14,Nice goal  St. Louis kid also !blues.
bostonbruins,lxgwixw,2024-11-16 13:28:57,honestly love the energy we're playing with refreshing to see
bostonbruins,lxgwu15,2024-11-16 13:30:35,Fuck the entire blues team.

bostonbruins,lxgxjff,2024-11-16 13:34:15,not the biggest Frederic fan but boy is he having a game tonight if he brings this effort every night he's up for a solid pay day
bostonbruins,lxgxm0g,2024-11-16 13:34:37,OK this might be worth getting up at 5 in the morning for. LFG BRUINS!
bostonbruins,lxgy4ie,2024-11-16 13:37:18,That wasn't even close there was just straight up 6 guys playing

bostonbruins,lxh6xj6,2024-11-16 14:24:17,Imagine what the score might be if this team could hit the broad side of a barn.
bostonbruins,lxh8kld,2024-11-16 14:33:02,Think Oesterle might have saved a goal in that sequence. Don't mind this timeout at all. We're on our heels right now.
bostonbruins,lxhasds,2024-11-16 14:44:57,I forgot this was a matinee game so I just ate the last of my leftover birthday cake. EXTEND THIS LEAD PLS.
bostonbruins,lxhb6dc,2024-11-16 14:47:05,Something like 1:10 of 4 on 3 left
bostonbruins,lxhh47j,2024-11-16 15:19:38,Now that was really terrible positioning.
bostonbruins,lxhjxia,2024-11-16 15:35:04,Great play by Mase
bostonbruins,lxhmivt,2024-11-16 15:49:10,![gif](giphy|DYGBHeNkvvZFlfrA84|downsized)
bostonbruins,lxhmpii,2024-11-16 15:50:10,Wow is that what happens when you shoot a puck on net? The Bruins should try that
bostonbruins,lxhmqn3,2024-11-16 15:50:21,Oesterle played such a great game and then has THAT pass at the end. Ugh
bostonbruins,lxhmrx7,2024-11-16 15:50:33,Predictable.
bostonbruins,lxhmvnb,2024-11-16 15:51:07,This team is hopeless 
bostonbruins,lxhn7uk,2024-11-16 15:52:54,Holding onto the puck is like holding onto a baby in OT.  That pass to give it away was just brutal after the Bruins were otherwise very careful and good in OT.  Just terrible.
bostonbruins,lxhxts0,2024-11-16 16:51:00,My first game ever in Boston! What a shit effort
bostonbruins,lxj3d31,2024-11-16 21:04:12,It was brutal ngl. Freddy’s out there in OT with a chance for his first hat trick and they’re all fucking around like a fart in the wind. Wtf!!?!? TAKE THE FUCKING SHOT!!!
bostonbruins,lxgv584,2024-11-16 13:21:38,Good rebounding after that goal from Korpi. He moved like a fat kid on cake.
bostonbruins,lxhaxaw,2024-11-16 14:45:41,If Korpisalo keeps this up I’d like him to get the next start
bostonbruins,lxhgo6m,2024-11-16 15:17:12,Marchy has been fighting it a bit more than usual lately. And Hampus is much missed.
bostonbruins,lxhguki,2024-11-16 15:18:10,This team is so damn frustrating sometimes
bostonbruins,lxhgxqb,2024-11-16 15:18:40,They were going to miss the post eventually
bostonbruins,lxhmr9q,2024-11-16 15:50:27,A callup should not be on the ice during OT
bostonbruins,lxhh5jg,2024-11-16 15:19:50,They stand around in the defensive end like they’re playing beer league at 10 pm on a Tuesday and they’ve got work at 8 am.
bostonbruins,lxgvda8,2024-11-16 13:22:50,That’s what you call an elite goaltender - someone who can play saves the right way but when necessary throw the book out and still find a way to make a save
bostonbruins,lxgzm7f,2024-11-16 13:45:16,KORPI my god!!!
bostonbruins,lxh6jj2,2024-11-16 14:22:12,Korpisalo making a bid to be goalie #1. Finnish goalies don't have the worst track record in Boston either.
bostonbruins,lxhi9dg,2024-11-16 15:25:54,This team has been epically bad at getting shots through defenders for 4 years now.
bostonbruins,lxgogwk,2024-11-16 12:46:13,LETS GO! FUCK THE BLUES!
bostonbruins,lxgq04v,2024-11-16 12:54:19,Is this on fucking nhl network. God dammit
bostonbruins,lxgq61n,2024-11-16 12:55:10,Jesus another NHL Network game already?  Ahh well hope the high seas are calm today.
bostonbruins,lxgs25h,2024-11-16 13:05:10,I can't believe the game isn't on ESPN+ again.  I don't even know how I would go about getting NHL Network.  So stupid 
bostonbruins,lxgsimf,2024-11-16 13:07:35,Morning all !Don't make me regret getting up at 5am on my day off you sons of bitches... !!
bostonbruins,lxgt6zp,2024-11-16 13:11:14,I'll take it but that's a weak call.
bostonbruins,lxgtd3i,2024-11-16 13:12:08,Disagree with Brick. That’s a pretty easy call no? Marchand clearly wasn’t in possession of the puck can’t just pin him up against the boards
bostonbruins,lxgtnll,2024-11-16 13:13:44,Merk gets the puck and instantly fires at the net. The bruins need way more shoot first kinda players good on merk!
bostonbruins,lxgunia,2024-11-16 13:19:01,Bruins luck continues - post one way deflection the other

bostonbruins,lxgym7a,2024-11-16 13:39:54,I like this penalty kill but is Carlo and zadorov a good pairing? I guess try anything at this point
bostonbruins,lxgz595,2024-11-16 13:42:44,Colton Parayko:  huge D-man slow skater blocks a ton of shots minimal offensive contribution. You know Don Sweeney is fully erect watching him play.

bostonbruins,lxh8rgl,2024-11-16 14:34:04,Wow where were this refs in 2019
bostonbruins,lxh90po,2024-11-16 14:35:27,Holy shit great defense by McAvoy.  Sacrificed his body for that dive block and got up just in time to murder a dude.
bostonbruins,lxhepvu,2024-11-16 15:06:26,Why is it so hard for these camera guys to put the camera on the center of the red line?

bostonbruins,lxhjo6c,2024-11-16 15:33:39,This is borderline a repeat of the Sens game where we didn’t have a single shot in the third.
bostonbruins,lxhju34,2024-11-16 15:34:31,Might be the first mistake Oesterle has made today
bostonbruins,lxhkdy7,2024-11-16 15:37:29,And we're back
bostonbruins,lxhligw,2024-11-16 15:43:38,If they can play even half a game at that last shifts mentality they'd be further up in the standings.Oh and maybe a few more shots in goal....

bostonbruins,lxgy7d9,2024-11-16 13:37:43,Lots of talk about the goalies not making the critical big save. Korp makes those insane saves when down 1-0 and we immediately score 2 to take the lead. Thats the kind of save we’ve been waiting for. I fucking love Swayman and think he’ll be fine when all is said and done but if I’m Monty I’m starting Korp again Monday at this point. Give Swayman a reset.
bostonbruins,lxh1j30,2024-11-16 13:55:27,I’m just gonna say this the downvote trolls and bots can suck all of my white ass in this thread To my true fans where you at?#LETS GO BRUINS

bostonbruins,lxh8cy2,2024-11-16 14:31:54,I appreciate Korpi for at least trying rather than just standing there and whining for a call.  Kinda soft but that’s they way they’re calling it this year
bostonbruins,lxh8i7w,2024-11-16 14:32:41,Big dick energy from Korpi

bostonbruins,lxh5p03,2024-11-16 14:17:39,I'd be more angry about 9 shots in 28 minutes if we weren't in the lead.
bostonbruins,lxh6bkd,2024-11-16 14:21:01,Dude korpi is throwing me back to tim thomas the diving is UNREAL HES BATTLING.
bostonbruins,lxhj65m,2024-11-16 15:30:55,Goal differential in the third period ranked as 31st makes sense
bostonbruins,lxhje1c,2024-11-16 15:32:07,korpi's mask is amazing
bostonbruins,lxhmr2w,2024-11-16 15:50:25,Oesterle Coyle and Frederic out in OT should be firable.
bostonbruins,lxhox9l,2024-11-16 16:02:08,I've eaten alot of pucks in my life and the only way you're going to score on me is if you shoot the FN puck. What so hard to understand easy peasy. I'll feel bad if Monty gets fired. He deserves better from this team.
bostonbruins,lxgzscr,2024-11-16 13:46:10,I already said that Korpi should start 2 off the next 3 last game. I think they go back to every other game until Sway can work out whatever he needs to work through. Korpi is straight up battling out there
bostonbruins,lxgu1a3,2024-11-16 13:15:45,Hitting the post not being a SOG is hillarious..

bostonbruins,lxhfs9v,2024-11-16 15:12:16,I wonder if Swayman would do better if they went back to alternating goalies because Korpi has honestly looked pretty good in the games he’s played.

bostonbruins,lxh2kmy,2024-11-16 14:00:59,I think Korpi can crack the Finnish 4-nations lineup if he gets some more starts coming up. Saros will be the #1 but UPL has had a slow start and the backup roll is open.
bostonbruins,lxhh39d,2024-11-16 15:19:29,Will we ever have more shots on goal than the other team? Will we ever have more zone time than the other team? My hope is we get at least a point each game. My how my expectations have fallen :(

bostonbruins,lxhjf8b,2024-11-16 15:32:18,It’s both/and. The Bruins hung Korpi out to dry against a very good team but he also played badly in that game himself. That’s been the case for Swayman too. The issue most people had with Korpisalo is the amount of money going towards goaltending vs. skaters.
bostonbruins,lxh97sj,2024-11-16 14:36:31,Fuuuuck… huge loss.  Dude was quietly 4/4 on faceoffs today.

bostonbruins,lxhb8tu,2024-11-16 14:47:28,Honestly it's win/win with Korpi playing like this. Eases a lot of doubt about his ability as back up and I think Sway performs better with a little competition for the starting spot.
bostonbruins,lxgvnfq,2024-11-16 13:24:20,Yes after being the biggest Korpisallo hater I am fully on the SS. Korpi coming to absolutely fucking carpet bomb the Blues

bostonbruins,lxh8pb9,2024-11-16 14:33:44,It's soft but consistent. Pretty much any contact in the paint prior to a goal has deemed GI. Agree it's not in the spirit of the rule but they haven't been wildly subjective about the calls either.
bostonbruins,lxhmvlw,2024-11-16 15:51:07,We’re actually a very young team. Slow but not old outside Marchand. Also you might want to look at all the NMCs we racked up.
bostonbruins,lxhnas2,2024-11-16 15:53:21,They have approximately 1 “old guy”

bostonbruins,lxh8awf,2024-11-16 14:31:36,You have to get at least one shot on that rush
bostonbruins,lxhg5bc,2024-11-16 15:14:16,Maybe? But a lot of it has also been about the whole team — including Swayman and Korpisalo — not really showing up against top offensive talent when we’ve faced them. Swayman had an unreal third against Seattle and was very solid against the Blues. But against Carolina and Dallas he let in goals he should have had *and* the entire team fell apart. Korpisalo was also pretty soft against Florida (team didn’t show up) and Colorado (team did except for the PK). That’s worrying.

bostonbruins,lxfr3xm,2024-11-16 09:39:27,Tufte is a big former 1st round draft pick. I hope he puts it all together here
bostonbruins,lxg4tp0,2024-11-16 11:00:09,Told him to go get some Nice Slice while he recovers
bostonbruins,lxi21kq,2024-11-16 17:14:23,Two up one to IR and one to RI. I can see why it's confusing.
bostonbruins,lxgt3m3,2024-11-16 13:10:44,Wonder if Beech is dealing with a minor injury or something. Otherwise makes no sense that he’d be benched when the 4th line is our best line.
bostonbruins,lxft2ui,2024-11-16 09:51:49,I mean they should give all the young kids all the min in the top lines. See how they do. Not like the Bruins could play much worse
bostonbruins,lxfp572,2024-11-16 09:26:44,People always get mad when anyone else gets called up but Lysell really hasn't shown he has what it takes in the preseason or the AHL
bostonbruins,lxgt76w,2024-11-16 13:11:16,I think he’s currently injured.Edit: never mind he played last night so whatever it was must’ve resolved.
bostonbruins,lxg53pc,2024-11-16 11:01:38,He’s also been injured a while hasn’t he?
bostonbruins,lxg18jp,2024-11-16 10:40:13,He’s put together plenty of penalties so far
bostonbruins,lxfzdf1,2024-11-16 10:29:27,All who? The prospect cupboard is bare.
bostonbruins,lxg0ebi,2024-11-16 10:35:23,I thought he performed pretty well in the preseason honestly. Providence he certainly hasn't shown what's needed but the thing is some players are just better on the big stage. I'd like to see him get a few shots in the NHL to see if maybe he's one of those types of guys rather than having him sit in the AHL playing with guys like Brown.
bostonbruins,lxfz3o6,2024-11-16 10:27:54,I hate to have to say it but the kid might be a bust. We have no idea what the issue is but his head isn’t on straight.
bostonbruins,lxg39gf,2024-11-16 10:51:31,Seems to be the trend with this team
bostonbruins,lxg0t6c,2024-11-16 10:37:45,Anyone lol who cares maybe there is a diamond in the rough down there. Doesn't hurt to try at this point. Not like the top guys are doing anything.
bostonbruins,lxg4nyv,2024-11-16 10:59:15,He looked pretty rough this preseason. Nothing about it made me think he is ready for the NHL.
bostonbruins,lxgf24n,2024-11-16 11:55:53,He’s definitely a bust should have traded him when his name had some juice
bostonbruins,lxg4o09,2024-11-16 10:59:15,Seriously. Kaprizov was drafted 5th round in 2015 look at him now. May as well just give whoever a shot and see if anything sticks
bostonbruins,lxhbcwt,2024-11-16 14:48:05,He was drafted that late primarily over concerns about whether he’d come to US or not talent wise people had him a lot higher but you’re point still stands
bostonbruins,lxgsu0s,2024-11-16 13:09:16,Exactly. What they got doesn't work. So might as well go to all the Providence players and go. Ok you will not have a better opportunity then right now. No one is looking good. So look good now and they can't send you back
bostonbruins,lxflxqe,2024-11-16 09:05:35,Merkulov called up brown sent down Let's goooo
bostonbruins,lxg96ll,2024-11-16 11:24:02,Really hope merk gets in today
bostonbruins,lxfm91z,2024-11-16 09:07:40,Seen a rumour that bruins are asking about Zegras. Not saying I want him at all but what would that trade look like? Does he find his game again with a change of scenery?
bostonbruins,lxj8904,2024-11-16 21:36:28,:sigh: This team just makes me sad right now man..
bostonbruins,lxg4go6,2024-11-16 10:58:07,I do not want Trevor Zegras
bostonbruins,lxgectd,2024-11-16 11:52:04,Merk and tufte in. Beecher and brown out. No goalie decided as of 11:40 am.
bostonbruins,lxfy6wg,2024-11-16 10:22:36,Wish the Bruins would fuck off with all these 2pm games on weekends my kid keeps me busy enough I can’t watch in the afternoons. The 9pm starts this week can fuck off too it’s hard enough staying awake until midnight to watch a game especially with how they’ve been playing lately.
bostonbruins,lxfncgg,2024-11-16 09:14:53,A ray of sunshine finally appears on the horizon!
bostonbruins,lxfwco1,2024-11-16 10:11:43,How about a bag of pucks
bostonbruins,lxgavlh,2024-11-16 11:33:16,I used to hate him but...apparently he's not a terrible guy and he's been working on his defense.
bostonbruins,lxi38rw,2024-11-16 17:21:08,At least his contract would only be one extra year if he didn't work out.  The team is desperate for top 6 talent and we only have enough trade assets to go bargain hunting.
bostonbruins,lxg4joa,2024-11-16 10:58:34,That’s the NHL and time zone differences not Boston.
bostonbruins,lxggkpj,2024-11-16 12:04:06,I’d take him for that!
bostonbruins,lxe0e4i,2024-11-16 00:08:23,Fuck the blues I'm tired of this losing shit.

bostonbruins,lxek37l,2024-11-16 03:13:08,Well at least it's at a decent time in the UK so I'm not having to stay up till 3 am to watch a half arsed performance again!

bostonbruins,lxh36tw,2024-11-16 14:04:17,Torey Krug is a former pledge he gets a free pass.
bostonbruins,lxftjlu,2024-11-16 09:54:43,Happy birthday! It's also former Bruin and fellow Granite Stater Tim Schaller's birthday
bostonbruins,lxgrlr5,2024-11-16 13:02:45,Looks like there’s a lot more life in Providence than Boston
bostonbruins,lxdtvyp,2024-11-15 23:19:15,Always a good time at the P Bruins
bostonbruins,lxjlcvk,2024-11-16 23:05:21,How’s Poitras doing on the Ps?
bostonbruins,lxgxp64,2024-11-16 13:35:04,This was after a missed call on our side where we then retaliated a bit got called and the refs lost control of the game. But these guys are fighting I really liked kuntars effort. Wasn’t the best but was scrapping and fighting every second to keep us going.
bostonbruins,lxgxri4,2024-11-16 13:35:23,Agreed they put in work just wish we filled in seats more for them
bostonbruins,lxjn7yv,2024-11-16 23:19:10,He played pretty well from what I saw
bostonbruins,lxdfy1f,2024-11-15 21:44:52,at first I thought she's doing something completely different
bostonbruins,lxdnc92,2024-11-15 22:33:38,Oh neat we make the playoffs :-)
bostonbruins,lxdpfg8,2024-11-15 22:47:40,She’s crying you perverts
bostonbruins,lxdp89u,2024-11-15 22:46:19,Bruins get eliminated while you're getting head? I can think of worse futures.
bostonbruins,lxdg1lo,2024-11-15 21:45:32,Can you imagine how Steve Dangle would react to this
bostonbruins,lxdow5n,2024-11-15 22:44:01,That would have explained the expression on his face!
bostonbruins,lxdrpli,2024-11-15 23:03:27,Thank you  the comments are hilarious but i dont want to get banned for posting nsfw when it isnt
bostonbruins,lxdg9t7,2024-11-15 21:47:06,it definitely wouldn't dangle
bostonbruins,lxd1m80,2024-11-15 20:11:25,The A has some real goonery he’ll need to keep his head up for sure. Go Bruins!
bostonbruins,lxd5k8m,2024-11-15 20:36:45,My nephew sang before that game tonight! I just watched the video my brother sent me!
bostonbruins,lxdcy2o,2024-11-15 21:24:38,how did he look?
bostonbruins,lxd6kpz,2024-11-15 20:43:19,Why he’s in 21? Have they always worn different numbers in the ahl vs nhl??
bostonbruins,lxd30so,2024-11-15 20:20:21,Jealous of those free t-shirts tonight. Enjoy the game. Never a bad time at the Dunk.... Amica...
bostonbruins,lxd6a7o,2024-11-15 20:41:25,Half the reason we got our season tickets was for the goonery. Always a good time
bostonbruins,lxd5y6j,2024-11-15 20:39:15,Why so many teams really don't want to send down players for a conditioning stint.
bostonbruins,lxd7pip,2024-11-15 20:50:40,Which group? They did great the Anthem especially so!
bostonbruins,lxdr6gj,2024-11-15 22:59:38,If you listened closely you could make out his voice. He had the lowest voice in the group. He did really well!
bostonbruins,lxdm1th,2024-11-15 22:25:16,He looked good until the third started to get slow I think maybe he was conserving but he wasn’t finishing. He took a few good hits but otherwise did well. Made a couple hits tho which I was impressed with
bostonbruins,lxdjkmu,2024-11-15 22:09:07,How’s the vibe over there compared to the big league games?
bostonbruins,lxd7llr,2024-11-15 20:49:58,Yea Ian Mitchell has 51 in Prov. They usually switch numbers when they go between teams. At least for the most part. Brazzer was 16 in prov last year and 55 when he got called up to Boston. I think Lohrei was 2 down here. Bill Sweezey is 6 here now (he doesn’t like me very much ) Boston takes precedence so they assign their numbers in training camp but for the main roster that stays here they can kinda pick their numbers to an extent.
bostonbruins,lxd6ffh,2024-11-15 20:42:23,It’ll always be the Dunk
bostonbruins,lxdahe5,2024-11-15 21:08:20,He was in the first group that was from the middle school hopefully the baby B's win it and cap it off for them!!
bostonbruins,lxdls24,2024-11-15 22:23:30,It’s always a good time. The refs were the same as in the NHL tho. Missed a clear goal and then called back another for what I’m assuming was GI even tho he was never touched
bostonbruins,lxdicuk,2024-11-15 22:01:04,Why doesn't he like you?
bostonbruins,lxda2od,2024-11-15 21:05:43,I'm not that old but it will always be the Civic Center to me.
bostonbruins,lxf7vmp,2024-11-16 07:20:13,Always forget that there are thriving AHL markets. My state had the Kings affiliate for a long time. It was an incredible economy boom when they arrived but the last 5 years of their stay here was a ghost town. Sad to see.
bostonbruins,lxdm8ft,2024-11-15 22:26:27,I may have said something last week he didn’t like even tho the rest of the bench thought it was hilarious and were laughing at him for it. 
bostonbruins,lxdo4vz,2024-11-15 22:38:54,I am that old and it will ALWAYS be the civic center.
bostonbruins,lxljd6f,2024-11-17 09:44:28,We went to a ton of Worcester sharks games back in the day. Now they’re the Worcester railers.

flyers,lxu9y9c,2024-11-18 18:36:19,Also cousin came in clutch with not being able to use tickets for suite tonight
flyers,lxuajt0,2024-11-18 18:39:48,Maybe one day we won’t have to scratch Frost he just won’t be on the roster. That will be a good day.
flyers,lxub28b,2024-11-18 18:42:47,If the flyers win I know they did it because it’s a wonderful gift to give on my birthday
flyers,lxub4ig,2024-11-18 18:43:09,AHHHHHHHHHH i loved the last flyers game!
flyers,lxub62c,2024-11-18 18:43:24,long live dollar dog night (a sad phillies fan)
flyers,lxub23i,2024-11-18 18:42:46,I’ll be sure to look out for an animated platypus from my vantage point up in the 200s tonight I see you I’ll wave hi lol
flyers,lxtnyh6,2024-11-18 16:37:01,The OT series ender was a crazy sequence and a spectacular shot and celebrationAnd forgot to mention but one of the best play by play calls for Philly sports ever
flyers,lxthivg,2024-11-18 16:04:36,His playing days were before  my time in terms of an aware flyers fan but I’m still salty on the whole crying after we loss the cup to the Hawks. “It’s the Chicago Blackhawks man”
flyers,lxtjgrv,2024-11-18 16:14:20,If only the defense on that 2004 team wasn’t so injured….
flyers,lxu0fem,2024-11-18 17:42:16,The way he played was pure flyer. Even though his stint was short he’s up there on a short list of my favorite flyers ever.
flyers,lxtvzpi,2024-11-18 17:18:26,SIgh....that 2004 team.  So loaded LeClair Roenick Amonte Gagne Primeau Recchi Desjardins probably so many more I'm forgetting.  God damn the stupid lockout.  Kills me watching so many guys leave the team.  Team was basically unrecognizable.
flyers,lxu1z0b,2024-11-18 17:50:41,That 2004 playoff run was truly one of my first Flyers memories. The OT winner against TOR constantly lives in my head and I’m privileged to have been at Game 6 against Tampa in the Conference Finals. What I would do to experience a game like that again
flyers,lxtuadg,2024-11-18 17:09:22,This is gonna be a depressing post. Sad as it is to say - these were the days. I loved all the teams from this era - as flawed as they were it was always a fun ride. The landscape of nhl has changed so much now. Didn't win anything and still didn't realize how good we had it. Many mistakes made along the way. We're like 2-3 eras removed from these days now so things get lost along the way. However the most depressing thing to me is that it seems like absolutely no lessons were learned. Consistently losing to teams with better goaltending. Consistently losing to teams with a better blue line. Consistently losing to teams with more discipline. Consistently self destructing and folding like a house of cards at any sign of adversity.
flyers,lxtwtf9,2024-11-18 17:22:54,I have a vivid childhood memory of Roenick breaking his jaw or his nose or something and seeing blood on his face and the ice when he got up and tbh thats one of my core sports memories. I have no idea what game it was or when but It’s imprinted in my mind forever.
flyers,lxtf9xl,2024-11-18 15:53:18,Roenick was before my team sadly I’ve seen highlights of these legendary Flyers through Youtube.
flyers,lxu9nyw,2024-11-18 18:34:40,Early 2000s flyers got 8 year old me to play hockey i still play to this day on a shitty beer league team. All roads lead to beer league.
flyers,lxtsck9,2024-11-18 16:59:15,Core (states) Flyers memory for me.
flyers,lxtkevm,2024-11-18 16:19:05,At the time they had a longer drought than the Flyers. That was a magical run that year. I remember that time more vividly than the Eagles winning it all. Side note: the nhl should bring back the History will be made commercials from back then
flyers,lxtp3pa,2024-11-18 16:42:51,He was drafted by them then played for the 8 years there.The closest he ever came to the cup was a 0-4 finals loss with Chicago.
flyers,lxtnaa2,2024-11-18 16:33:37,Agreed I was embarrassed for Roenick.  I laughed out loud when Milbury goofed on him
flyers,lxtp8g1,2024-11-18 16:43:31,More like: if only Clarke didn't trade away our blueline depth in 2004
flyers,lxtz9ue,2024-11-18 17:36:05,Zuesssssss and Kapanen are the other notables.  And eyebrow man himself Donald brasher if you’d want to include the muscle.
flyers,lxtzetf,2024-11-18 17:36:50,[Here you go](https://youtu.be/Dsc41szSwLM?si=6pMOkr0sS-xwMGlu). Right back on for the powerplay I'm pretty sure lol
flyers,lxtu2oq,2024-11-18 17:08:14,That sequence is unforgettable for almost every Flyers fan… except Sami Kapanen.
flyers,lxu15t1,2024-11-18 17:46:15,I forgot it was the CoreStates Center for a minute.  Favorite name is still FU Center.
flyers,lxskizn,2024-11-18 13:18:19,Good to see Kolosov get a shot.
flyers,lxslom9,2024-11-18 13:24:06,Helge Grans sounds like some part of the male anatomy
flyers,lxstfmu,2024-11-18 14:02:50,He has played the shit out of sanny for weeks lol
flyers,lxsl7tv,2024-11-18 13:21:46,Is this them giving Grans a look in the NHL? I completely forgot about the dude. He was a throw in from the Provy trade I think. 35th overall in 2020 draft so here’s his shot. This is cool I totally forgot about him. It’s nice to have another “oh shit let’s check him out” thing to look forward to tonight.Also if that final quote in the title is legit that fucking rules.
flyers,lxt397k,2024-11-18 14:52:13,I’m probably the only man on earth that’s gonna say this but I’m glad to see Grans in. I don’t expect much to be honest from him but I would like to see what this already largely forgotten prospect can do in the bigs. One thing I like about the flyers under Briere and  Tortorella is all of the prospects get a shot eventually even if there’s bigger names behind them. The worst thing is writing a guy off before he sees nhl ice and he becomes serviceable somewhere else. That said uh may god have mercy on that third pair and Sanheim and Risto better take some Advil before the game because they’re going to be carrying this defense on their backs
flyers,lxsywx7,2024-11-18 14:30:17,+1 for the Bluesky link. Hopefully the US oligarchy doesn't try buying that too.
flyers,lxuatnz,2024-11-18 18:41:24,Grans is my pick for unexpected Flyers D that’s gonna become a legit NHLer somehow just because someone at some point has to.
flyers,lxspv7s,2024-11-18 13:45:07,Whom??
flyers,lxsnz2m,2024-11-18 13:35:33,A lot of shots. From Nate the Dog MacKinnon
flyers,lxt23rk,2024-11-18 14:46:25,Dude has gotten a bit better. Nice to see. Hope he gets really comfortable and has fun.
flyers,lxsv5sw,2024-11-18 14:11:30,Grans DefensThe question is epiddi listen to Uretha Franklin before practice?  Because we need to respect the Avs offensive talent and teste their goaltender early.  Penis.
flyers,lxtgby1,2024-11-18 15:58:36,And Risto. I need more from him to justify his contract.
flyers,lxslqi9,2024-11-18 13:24:22,> Is this them giving Grans a look in the NHL?It's they need 6 healthy D because Andrea got injured Saturday.
flyers,lxsod3x,2024-11-18 13:37:32,He has played in the AHL for 4 years. Last year his 24p (1g) in 56gp was his most so far.         Seems like the highlight of career was representing Sweden at the World Juniors in 2022 where he got 4a in 7gp.       Big night for him congratulations to Helge.
flyers,lxt3nze,2024-11-18 14:54:19,We got him in the Petersen and Walker cap dump. heck maybe we can make lightning strike twice and get a nhl player out of him
flyers,lxtc3cw,2024-11-18 15:37:22,Yeah Grans was pretty bad the last 2 years which is why hes been an afterthought.This has a lot more to do w/ the Phantoms having no good choice RHDs right now.Attard was traded and Ginning/Gleason/Macdonald are LHD. So it was either Belpedio Grans or Samson.  None ideal choices.
flyers,lxtdmqh,2024-11-18 15:45:07,I don’t have the quote handy but Torts has a comment in his presser I found interesting.  He was asked about Grans’ call up maybe something about what he had seen in Grans and he was quick to say that it was a Briere/Lappy decision because they know the LV guys better.  But then he said something interesting maybe insinuating that they might currently be more impressed by other guys but that those guys might be younger and not as far along in their development and when they activate a call up it’s not just “who’s performing best” but it’s also a consideration of how a call up might affect their development or long term game.   I might try to find the exact quote but I thought that was interesting and made me wonder who if anyone he might be referring to.EDIT: It’s when he answers Charlie’s first question.  I didn’t get it exactly right.  I don’t think he used the word “development” but said “process.”   Similar I’d say.  But different for sure.

flyers,lxtm92m,2024-11-18 16:28:22,Risto has been great.
flyers,lxsm99u,2024-11-18 13:26:58,I get that but I just thought it could’ve been Ginning or McDonald that got the call at this point.  Just excited it’s Grans. I like sink or swim moments.
flyers,lxua7wq,2024-11-18 18:37:53,They could have called up Belpedio if they wanted someone more experienced. This is definitely giving the kid a shot. Pretty normal for someone in the last year of their ELC if they’ve never played in the NHL yet.
flyers,lxt3evo,2024-11-18 14:53:01,Supposedly Grans has done well in the AHL so far this year. Not sure if he is anything at all but at least he's getting a chance.
flyers,lxte0uk,2024-11-18 15:47:05,They’re almost assuredly referring to Hunter McDonald if it’s from the perspective of what Briere/Jones look for. Numerous interviews over the summer and coming out of camp had them both mentioning McDonald consistently.
flyers,lxu6bst,2024-11-18 18:15:18,This did not deserve the laugh I gave it lol.
flyers,lxsoa2y,2024-11-18 13:37:06,My guess is they wanted to call up a RHD and not another LHD since the callup is being paired with Zamula.
flyers,lxtc8qb,2024-11-18 15:38:07,Ginning Macdonald and Gleason (who we got for Attard) are LHDsRHD is extremely weak w/ just Belpedio Samson and Grans.
flyers,lxteg52,2024-11-18 15:49:14,You might be right.  I edited my comment with the link to the video starting with the question that leads to his answer.

flyers,lxshh2l,2024-11-18 13:02:51,Don’t worry we’ll play ourselves out of a good draft pick soon enough.
flyers,lxtjj8f,2024-11-18 16:14:41,That's my favorite draft position bby. Please lose ffs.
flyers,lxsi8d0,2024-11-18 13:06:42,Nah this team has consistently collapsed under torts in the back half of the last two years goal is to stay around pick ten then when they collapse they have a good shot at the first pick.
flyers,lxtdbg9,2024-11-18 15:43:33,Their collapse last year still only got them the 12th pick and were a game away from making playoffs ... And we have added Michkov.Flyers easily had worse lineups in 2022 and 2023 and they finished w/ 5th and 7th picks.Barring huge injuries and/or dead last goalie play this team is not getting near 1st pick.Teams like Chicago SJS Montreal are on another level.  2 are fully tanking and the other has an atrocious head coach that has them playing zero defense while we have someone like Torts who gets his teams to play above their level every year.If you think your roster is bad you need to look at teams like Chicago and SJS who are actually tanking.
flyers,lxty13u,2024-11-18 17:29:23,"""on another level"" has me thinking about that South Park episode where the Denver kids are crazy good at tanking little league."
flyers,lxsf8u8,2024-11-18 12:51:42,I want to believe this but pretty sure just coincidence with setting his helmet straight with his blocker hand haha
flyers,lxsc2wf,2024-11-18 12:35:59,omfuckinggod i can’t believe we are doing the wave at a Flyers game
flyers,lxsoczf,2024-11-18 13:37:31,When Fedotov does the wave it becomes a tsunami.
flyers,lxt1mzg,2024-11-18 14:44:03,Man is it great to see the fans having fun again.
flyers,lxsuhkz,2024-11-18 14:08:09,I thought his name was Ivan
flyers,lxsw0wz,2024-11-18 14:15:48,I was there that game too....we did it like 4 times...
flyers,lxth5ti,2024-11-18 16:02:46,Genuinely can’t remember the last time I’ve seen the wave at the Farg.
flyers,lxu3nzl,2024-11-18 18:00:05,Protect this man.
flyers,lxslafe,2024-11-18 13:22:08,embarrassing. there's a game going on.
flyers,lxsgto5,2024-11-18 12:59:33,Yeah definitely a coincidence I was just being cheeky
flyers,lxsfnw0,2024-11-18 12:53:48,He's a sweetheart and a goofball.  I wouldn't put it past him.
flyers,lxsea7m,2024-11-18 12:46:56,When it’s 4-1 you gotta do what you gotta do lol
flyers,lxsfaz8,2024-11-18 12:52:00,Was at the game said the same thing
flyers,lxsec12,2024-11-18 12:47:11,So lame.
flyers,lxstwws,2024-11-18 14:05:16,Humangas beeg wave
flyers,lxsyi17,2024-11-18 14:28:13,Lol it is.  He is saying that EVEN Ivan Fedotov is doing the wave.
flyers,lxt1vyc,2024-11-18 14:45:18,I bet you boo when there is a fight too.
flyers,lxsppjg,2024-11-18 13:44:19,Were you two college roommates? /s
flyers,lxt1rps,2024-11-18 14:44:43,I remember doing waves when we managed to score 1 goal.
flyers,lxsh0a6,2024-11-18 13:00:29,God forbid someone has fun at a hockey game. Let me guess you hate Gritty too?
flyers,lxt691x,2024-11-18 15:07:28,Oh Ivan is his middle name?
flyers,lxtu9gs,2024-11-18 17:09:14,no I'm actually there for the on-ice entertainment. fighting is a part of hockey doing the wave isn't. nice try though.
flyers,lxsufie,2024-11-18 14:07:52,LOL yeah back in my wild days at the University of Soviet Socialist Republics.
flyers,lxsmyix,2024-11-18 13:30:27,I love Gritty but I hate the wave and always will. God forbid I want to sit in my seat and not have some obnoxious dude yelling and shit trying to start the wave while I'm trying to enjoy whatever sporting event I'm at. It's annoying and will always be annoying.
flyers,lxt6nzp,2024-11-18 15:09:35,Yes
flyers,lxt7pgg,2024-11-18 15:14:59,No no *who’s* on first
flyers,lxt73a0,2024-11-18 15:11:46,Isn’t it just awful that you don’t have the freedom to stay seated in your chair and ignore it when the wave comes your way? I can’t imagine how angry you get too when the loud goal horn goes off since it’s so loud and obnoxious. Really takes away from enjoying the nice and quiet hockey game.
flyers,lxtsv9b,2024-11-18 17:01:56,Bahumbug
flyers,lxtgdaj,2024-11-18 15:58:47,Lmao yes goal horns and drunk people trying to get a wave going are totally 1 to 1 as a comparison. Truly a dizzying intellect.
flyers,lxrg4ky,2024-11-18 09:46:47,Columbus would probably want our 1st round pick this year. No offense but the Risto and Frost offer is laughable.
flyers,lxrgcoe,2024-11-18 09:48:07,Drysdale + 2nd
flyers,lxrgz1o,2024-11-18 09:51:46,I didn’t much like Jiricek in that draft year… and nothing I’ve seen has made me super hyped on him now.
flyers,lxrgjjf,2024-11-18 09:49:15,If I'm Columbus there's no chance Risto + Frost is enough for Jiricek
flyers,lxroipe,2024-11-18 10:34:17,To everyone saying Ristolainen and Frost isn't enough for Jiricek.That's fine.  But if I'm Philadelphia I think probably even that is an overpay for a young but promising player who has shown a history of not wanting to take a reasonable development path.Kid can't stay in the lineup and won't play in the AHL.  That's going to hurt his value.  Columbus is welcome to keep him though and deal with the headache themselves.
flyers,lxrlkx1,2024-11-18 10:18:07,I feel like I missing something he's barely done anything at the NHL level that seems like a gross overpay on potential.  I mean we already have Drysdale as a reclamation project who's supposedly also projected as a #1D.My offer is nothing.  Seems to me we have a much bigger need for Centers at this point given how our defense is playing.
flyers,lxrfpk1,2024-11-18 09:44:20,If it takes Risto and Frost and a first then we better not be paying a single  Looney of Risto's contract going forward
flyers,lxrltdp,2024-11-18 10:19:26,"I don't think Frost Ristolainen and Drysdale (the 3 names I've seen most in this thread) do anything for CLB. Hell I don't even think they're going to care much about any of our late 1sts that much really. They already have a stupid deep future C core in Fantilli/Lindstrom/Sillinger/Johnson/Voronkov so Frost doesn't do anything for them. Although Ristolainen has some value I think valuing him at a 1st for him with his current contract as a bit much and I don't think CBJ is in a position to get the most out of him especially when they already have Gudbranson. Finally although I certainly don't think Drysdale is 100% cooked and haven't given up on him I don't think he carries much value at all with his track record the last few years.Jiricek has struggles but he's a recent 6OA with a very high ceiling has the size and physicality we are missing on our blue line. Yes there have been struggles at the NHL level but quite frankly he put up great numbers in the AHL in his D+1 and D+2 and hasn't been the level of dissapointment some say he has. Especially with Shaw doing what Shaw does I think he'd have the potential to be better than Drysdale Andrae Bonk and even York in the long run and to me that's a better bet than taking late 1st round and 2nd round swings at the draft.All this to say: my offer would be significant. If CBJ said: ""Foerster Kolosov and the latest of your 3 2025 1sts  final offer take it or leave it"" I'm taking that if I'm Briere.Edit: Did not realize Gudbranson is out but still don't think they'd have any interest in Ristolainen"
flyers,lxrfwic,2024-11-18 09:45:28,From what I've heard his biggest issue is his attitude. If the reports are true I don't want a selfish player in the locker room. The whole point of what Danny is trying to do is rebuild the culture of the team. That's why he's gone after guys like Erik Johnson.
flyers,lxrith3,2024-11-18 10:02:25,I’m not crazy about giving up assets for a D-man. Seems like we have a pretty solid amount of depth at D. Jiricek would be an upgrade but I’d rather use our assets to address the center position. I wouldn’t make an offer
flyers,lxsr9f4,2024-11-18 13:52:02,Most of you guys are crazy for even entertaining the thought. The kid won’t play in the AHL. What does that say about his team-first mentality? Torts Danny and Jonesy would laugh at the idea of trading for Jiricek unless there was a 3-team deal where we ship his dumb ass somewhere else for assets that actually help now(ish) or in the future while also off-loading guys that don’t fit (sorry Frosty).If you make up scenarios where we go after a scoring LW or top flight #1C then yeah I’ll go “Be A GM Mode” with you. But this Jiricek kid ain’t it. Our problem is scoring goals (we’d be fucked without TK) not D. We need guys who are hungry not guys who are full (of themselves). 
flyers,lxrgae1,2024-11-18 09:47:44,I say make assessments but no moves until the week before the trade deadline when we get maximum value.
flyers,lxrhbgu,2024-11-18 09:53:48,*If* Columbus is looking for players to help ASAP something around Risto could make sense.Pure value wise I would trade one of Edmonton or Colorado's 1sts. I don't think Columbus would trade him within the division but I'd be all over it if they were interested.Also listening to the Jiricek section on 32T Elliotte says that Nashville is looking for a top 4 D *with term.* A potential Risto suitor?
flyers,lxrt369,2024-11-18 10:58:41,yes but risto and frost won’t get the trade done.
flyers,lxs1qra,2024-11-18 11:43:46,I would do Zamula + Brink/one of our late firsts. I like Jiricek a lot but Columbus is operating from a disadvantageous position. I’m not being super aggressive yet. If I was going to be aggressive it would be a winger and a pick. Farabee and Foerster would need more coming back from Buffalo for me to move brink and Laughton wouldn’t be enough. If I was gonna hit the all gas no brakes crazy move?Dylan Cozens and David Jiracek for Joel Farabee Kolosov Risto with retention and a late first.But that’s just some tinfoil hat armchair gming . I think I the flyers go the winger and/or pick route just from the sheer amount of players we have.
flyers,lxs5x47,2024-11-18 12:04:57,He's 20 and the team is already considering moving on from him. It's my understanding that he doesn't want to go down to the AHL which is part of why CBJ is considering a trade. That's a red flag for me. We don't need another Gauthier-esque thorn in our side right now.    I wouldn't move much to get him especially a vet like Ristolainen who would could get you a first-round pick at the trade deadline. I definitely wouldn't get into a bidding war with another team. Like you said there's too much of a logjam on D right now too and we don't need another reclamation project. I'd be fine with trading Zamula -- in a package of course because that's not going to get much of a return.
flyers,lxsgxs8,2024-11-18 13:00:07,I wouldn't give up much for Jiricek. Yeah he might have been the 6th overall puck from a couple of years ago but there's issues. Decision making in the defensive zone and relying on others to do all the heavy lifting is a big red flag. I get that he's 20/21 years old but you have to see some improvement and there's been nothing. Now it's possible that Shaw works his magic and gets Jiricek on track but there's also a possibility he fails. I'd offer Tuomaala straight up for him and even then I'm really hesitant on that (big Tuomaala fan). But yeah seeing things like first and second round picks and players for a disgruntled sixth overall that has done nothing? No not a chance.
flyers,lxsj8tx,2024-11-18 13:11:51,I’d hold onto Risto as a contending team would probably want him later this year and we’d get more value out of a trade like that. Unless CBJ really is interested in him but I doubt they are. They’d definitely want a pick or one of our higher end prospects
flyers,lxt9nf6,2024-11-18 15:24:57,Probably need to do a 3 way trade. Something at the TDL like Risto 50% retained to a contender and they send picks to Columbus and then we send Columbus a serviceable D prospect like Bonk in exchange for Jiricek.
flyers,lxrh42l,2024-11-18 09:52:36,I think your offer is the right one. The problem I have with him is he is not NHL ready by most accounts but refuses  to play in the A.  Now the question is... does he refuse to play in the AHL entirely or is it because he doesn't trust the Columbus system or their management.
flyers,lxrmhqo,2024-11-18 10:23:13,He's a interesting prospect for sure.
flyers,lxrovv4,2024-11-18 10:36:15,The flyers are also in a rebuild. CBJ would want a first + probably a prospect. This trade is a fantasy it won’t happen lol. I personally am not willing to give up on Drysdale + a first. Which is probably what it would take.
flyers,lxrqrh0,2024-11-18 10:46:20,The reason he's mad in Columbus is ***because*** he's playing in Cleveland. He's impatient and thinks he should be in the NHL. https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2832980 This is from January but it very much still applies.He would obviously be on our NHL team right now but attitude is an issue. Our first this year is too much. And I think they would want forward help more than anything else so idk about the Risto part of yours
flyers,lxrukhn,2024-11-18 11:06:34,Help me out here guys. Why is the value so high for Jiricek?I get that he was drafted highly but he hasn't been able to outcompete a pretty trashy D core in Columbus and hasn't exactly set the AHL on fire.He also shoots right and nothing in those stats looks to me like would beat out Drysdale or Bonk for a spot in a couple years.
flyers,lxrva85,2024-11-18 11:10:21,I think people are overvaluing Jiricek a bit as an asset right now.  Hes looked bad in NHL and has been a huge problem off the ice and even refused to go to AHL. Thats why CBJ is desperate just to get rid of him at this point.He will cost some value but those things will bring down his value a bit.I am not giving up our 1st this year or Risto Frost and a late 1st.
flyers,lxsc9fl,2024-11-18 12:36:53,He's not been as advertised.  Can't skate questionable attitude.  Unless they get him on a discount I'm staying away.
flyers,lxsehnr,2024-11-18 12:47:57,We don't need a spoiled brat
flyers,lxt3sx5,2024-11-18 14:55:00,Is Jiricek eligible to be sent down to the AHL? IIRC part of the problem in Columbus was he had to be in one league and not the other?
flyers,lxthm3a,2024-11-18 16:05:03,Pass for sure. I’d rather go for one of their centers instead.
flyers,lxtihi3,2024-11-18 16:09:28,not much.  He's going to be available on waivers in a couple of years.  Slow way behind schedule entitled attitude and very bad fitness habits.
flyers,lxtzf2t,2024-11-18 17:36:52,Nothing. This team desperately needs centers.
flyers,lxriv2q,2024-11-18 10:02:41,The correct answer here is Drysdale and a 2nd or maybe a late first if they twist our arm.  Frost and Risto can get us other assets later down the line.
flyers,lxrjbns,2024-11-18 10:05:20,I would give up one of COL or EDM’s firsts + Frost + another asset. Jiricek is that good.
flyers,lxrn23t,2024-11-18 10:26:17,They will want a 1st + young player. More likely its 1st + Bonk or Foerster your talking about a potential #1 D in the future. Other teams have more to offer so I don't really see a deal getting done.
flyers,lxtnndw,2024-11-18 16:35:28,Nothing. Jiricek is ASS.
flyers,lxrg2dr,2024-11-18 09:46:25,I think Risto and Frost is a massive overpay.I'd rather use Risto sooner rather than later to get a high draft pick (1st rounder if rumors are to be believed). Frost for Jiricek? It's a text book hockey trade change of scenery for both players. I wouldn't have too much of an issue there. The lack of center depth takes another hit there though.
flyers,lxtekas,2024-11-18 15:49:48,What's the reason why CBJ wants to move on from him? Like Gauthier last year if the teams hand is forced they wont get top value back and a top 5 pick would be stupid to give up. 
flyers,lxrhkp2,2024-11-18 09:55:16,What would you need if you were CBJ's GM? I was thinking Risto is a big RHD under contract for two more years after this one and has garnered interest around the league.Frost is also a young C who is under team control for this year and likely the next. With Johnson down they could use another C. Both players are NHL'ers and under team control. I wouldn't be giving them our first but I'd consider any of our 2nds and possibly depending on where it fell our lowest of the three 1sts we have in the upcoming draft.
flyers,lxrhovq,2024-11-18 09:55:56,So essentially a Gauthier for Jiricek trade.
flyers,lxrh5xh,2024-11-18 09:52:54,Full circle for who we should have drafted
flyers,lxrj6iz,2024-11-18 10:04:31,Columbus laughs at this
flyers,lxrtmar,2024-11-18 11:01:30,If you look at it from a pure fit point of view they don't need two d-men who fit the pure PP QB role.  With the emergence if Andrae Drysdale probably make the most sense to trade for him.That said you're banking on an awfully small sample size for Andrae in that scenario
flyers,lxrscdl,2024-11-18 10:54:45,Every time there is a trade for a young player that's getting no ice time who's upset at management people are always underwhelmed at the ensuing trade.  There is a reason Jiricek isn't playing.  There is a reason Columbus have rated him worse and worse year after year.  There is a reason he's upset and management isn't happy.  I think the kid is good obviously but the valuation of him is dropping the more Columbus bungle him over take playing time from him send him to AHL pull him from games bench him shift him from lines etc.Risto + Frost is low but do you really see it going THAT much higher for someone who's stock has been plummeting consistently since he came into the league?  No way this kid is getting a first or something.
flyers,lxrhqtk,2024-11-18 09:56:15,I get that. What would you ask for if you're CBJ?
flyers,lxruvpa,2024-11-18 11:08:13,Just saw this after commenting the same thing. He looks like a waste of space.
flyers,lxsbwe9,2024-11-18 12:35:05,Yeah this is a classic case of people overrating a player/asset b/c he used to be a hyped top prospect.  We saw this with the reaction to the Savioue trade this summer.Hes struggled so far in NHL (albeit young but suggests less likely hes blue chip if hes still bad in D+3) and been a huge headcase off the ice to the point hes forced his team to trade him.While we definitely still need help at D another unproven raw RHD isnt what we need.  If we add a RHD it would be a proven guy to replace Risto and help w/ Drysdale/Bonk who are only seemingly long term RHDs.Dont need another young unproven fringe NHL RHD that is struggling at NHL level but literally demands NHL minutes.  Like you said we got that in Drysdale.Unless the Flyers are confident he will be a high end NHLer but that doesnt appear nearly as likely now.
flyers,lxrtp8q,2024-11-18 11:01:56,Love when I see a fellow Canadian flyers fan 
flyers,lxrp46h,2024-11-18 10:37:31,"> I don't think Frost Ristolainen and Drysdale (the 3 names I've seen most in this thread) do anything for CLB. Hell I don't even think they're going to care much about any of our late 1sts that much really.Yeah if I'm a CBJ fan I'm probably linking this thread in their subreddit for a laugh because the offer truly is that bad. Frost is a dime a dozen ""skill"" guy at a position they don't need Risto is an overpaid physical defensemen who's not AS overpaid as he was a couple years ago and Drysdale is a chronically injured reclamation project.How in the *fuck* does that move the needle AT ALL for a potential stud #1 defenseman picked top 6 just two years ago?And yeah while I don't want to give up Foerster those are the kinds of risks you have to take if you want value like Jiricek back. Our fans here look at struggling dudes like Farabee and think other teams are salivating to poach them. It's wild."
flyers,lxrolqy,2024-11-18 10:34:44,All good points. I'm shocked you put Foerster in your trade for Jiricek. He's a non-starter for me. I'd rather give up Farabee despite our LW depth. I'd go our latest '25 first Bonk and Kolosov. Then I'd trade Risto to hopefully get a 2nd (if not a first) and draft a Bonk replacement.
flyers,lxru1hp,2024-11-18 11:03:45,I’d expand the trade to see about getting one of those centers too. I know Kent Johnson isn’t doing too much if we are giving up a bunch of assets make it with another C prospect coming back our way.
flyers,lxsgxm8,2024-11-18 13:00:06,If Columbus wants me to give up Tyson Foerster Aleksei Kolosov *and* a late first round pick to bring in their disgruntled defenseman who isn’t even cracking the NHL at this stage I’m hanging up the phone immediately. I believe in Jiricek’s upside to an extent but not to that extent.
flyers,lxt4eds,2024-11-18 14:58:02,If Columbus is interested in a winger then that's actually a major advantage for us. Wing is one of the strongest points in the Flyers right now (TK Michkov Tippett Farabee Foerster Brink Cates) and the natural thing to do with a position of strength is to fix a position of weakness. I'd agree with that offer you mentioned too even if I would prefer to try and sell Brink or Cates instead.
flyers,lxrhxjo,2024-11-18 09:57:19,I think this has been a bit overblown. I think it's likely due to the shit show that has been Columbus since he was drafted. If he wants to come over and start in the AHL I'd be willing to work with him.
flyers,lxt6144,2024-11-18 15:06:20,His biggest issue is he absolutely sucks at skating backwards/pivoting. Good aggression and skating on the offensive side of things but his rush defense is seriously problematic at this point in time at the NHL level. It’s gunna take a lot to fix it.
flyers,lxryi2n,2024-11-18 11:27:11,"""Seems like we have a pretty solid amount of depth at D."" - what makes you think so?Drysdale is hurt EJ is a 7th Risto is a 4/5 Zamula hasn't played well until last game.  York's ceiling is a 2 Sanheim isn't a 1D and Andre is a rookie.  They don't have anyone else ready to take more than a 5/6 spot."
flyers,lxridpl,2024-11-18 09:59:54,I heard the Nashville part too. I believe he also mentioned center help; possibly Frost? I looked at their roster and there isn't much coming back from Nashville that makes sense. What would you look for?
flyers,lxsax76,2024-11-18 12:30:11,Wait so is it a three-team trade with Buffalo involved that lands us both Jiricek and Cozens? I’m having trouble following how this would work.
flyers,lxrt3sv,2024-11-18 10:58:46,Or even their 2nd back. It is one of the picks we hold in the top 50.
flyers,lxrgng2,2024-11-18 09:49:53,> Frost for Jiricek? It's a text book hockey trade change of scenery for both players.No chance Columbus does this.  Jiricek is a 20 year old right handed defensemen that is making under a million.  They will get much better offers from other teams than a 1 for 1 with Frost being the return.
flyers,lxrjoch,2024-11-18 10:07:20,What would you think of Danny if when we lost cutter we got back rasmus ristolainen and Morgan frost?Or how about just Morgan frost.Are you high lol?
flyers,lxri6o9,2024-11-18 09:58:46,Jiricek was drafted 6th OA two years ago. Columbus isn’t trading him for a 2nd round pick or low-value assets like Risto and Frost. They would likely ask for our 1st this year or pass entirely. Someone else would likely be willing to give up a mid-round 1st or a similarly valued prospect for Jiricek.
flyers,lxriu3e,2024-11-18 10:02:31,This would be the funniest outcome
flyers,lxrtp5q,2024-11-18 11:01:56,Any sane NHL front office laughs at this true.Columbus though.. they always think they're like 3 years away maximum. I don't think this specific offer would wet their beak because Drysdale is still very raw and they're not looking for a prospect who may pan out in 5 years (the 2nd). But you dangle a couple veterans in their face? They might bite. Do we have the caliber of veterans who can do that though? Probably not imo.
flyers,lxrwvl7,2024-11-18 11:18:44,I dont think they would ... Jiricek has been a disaster for them which is why they are desperately trying to move himHes a frequent healthy scratch who refuses to play in AHL and is such a nuisance that the team feels like they have to get rid of him
flyers,lxrvgct,2024-11-18 11:11:15,I'm just saying as bad as Jiricek's situation is I don't think Risto/Frost package has much value leaguewide. Frost turns 26 this year and has never passed 50 points in his career. He's not old or anything but he's an RFA this summer no team control. Risto has been good but he's overpaid and while CBJ has plenty of space that'll get eaten up quickly when they have to pay their young guys.  Ultimately the price is whatever one team is willing to pay. Even if he doesn't fetch a first-rounder Risto/Frost is not going to be the best/most attractive offer CBJ gets. He was a top-10 pick 2 years ago and who plays a premium position. Zero zero zero percent chance that's enough.
flyers,lxrw6ir,2024-11-18 11:15:03,100%. People always *way* overrate struggling former top prospects that are traded.  Nearly every time we realize why they were traded (we are seeing this w/ Drysdale).Every CBJ fan ive read has said he doesnt deserve to play in NHL right now.  And hes a head case who refuses to play in AHL ...All of that is why CBJ is not just willing but WANTS to get rid of him.Thats not an asset you should pay big value for.
flyers,lxriv58,2024-11-18 10:02:42,I confess that I'm not super familiar with CBJ's organizational needs and/or cap space that comment was more me thinking that Risto + Frost just isn't that valuable of a package. That being said off the top of my head if I'm CBJ I'm demanding that one of our 25 firsts is in the deal any deal without that is a non-starter and I'd probably want a young player too (either one of the roster players or Bonk)
flyers,lxrvd2r,2024-11-18 11:10:46,I'm not Canadian I just assume anyone who plays hockey is paid in  Canadian Dollars because I'm an ignorant American
flyers,lxrzcf1,2024-11-18 11:31:32,Hello there friend!
flyers,lxrvjfp,2024-11-18 11:11:42,Fans always tend to overrate their own team's players and underrate other team's. You're right that they probably would be laughing at this thread but if we were in this situation with York they'd probably have their own thread discussing how they think Jordan Harris and a 3rd would be a fair offer for him
flyers,lxrqiae,2024-11-18 10:44:59,>I'm shocked you put Foerster in your trade for Jiricek. He's a non-starter for me. I'd rather give up Farabee despite our LW depth.I definitely wouldn't *want* to and would rather trade any one of Farabee/Brink/Frost/Cates/even Tippett before him but push comes to shove I'd be willing to move him if it meant having a realistic chance of adding a long term top pairing defenseman. Just looking at this year's draft I'd be more optimistic of Jiricek turning into a top pair guy over any one of Hensler/Smith/Mrtka (2nd-4th best D in this year's class).>I'd go our latest '25 first Bonk and Kolosov. Then I'd trade Risto to hopefully get a 2nd (if not a first) and draft a Bonk replacement.Agreed I think this is a good offer and honestly I'd prefer this option to the one I posted
flyers,lxruuao,2024-11-18 11:08:00,I like Johnson but he's dealing with a pretty significant injury right now IIRC and had a really strong start to the season don't think they'd be willing to move him. I really like Voronkov but I'm not sure they'd be willing to move him either
flyers,lxrkq0u,2024-11-18 10:13:18,He doesn’t want to play in the AHL. Pass.
flyers,lxrxnak,2024-11-18 11:22:43,He literally refuses to play in AHL despite being 20 and struggling in NHL.  He thinks hes better than he is and has been such a problem off the ice that his team is desperately trying to get rid of him.His off ice issues are definitely concerning.  And so far hes not good in NHL so isnt even looking like a blue chip prospect as much.
flyers,lxs33eq,2024-11-18 11:50:35,You know after looking at some other comments  the thought of having Sanheim York Drysdale and Jiricek in the top 4 is really appealing and I see what you’re saying. It realistically would make the strength of this team even more of a strength. But you’d basically be replacing Risto. And Risto in my opinion has been great. So that’s a tall order for a 20yo who has been struggling to replace. Rather than replacing a player who already has been playing well let’s spend some of that draft capitol and prospects to get a solid Centerman. Let’s address our weaknesses before addressing our strengths. + we have a couple guys in the minors and in juniors who are realistic NHL players we don’t NEED another defenseman especially considering how well Sanheim is playing. He + York have really solidified that top pair. I’m not sacrificing their minutes to try and develop Jiricek.
flyers,lxrk1ux,2024-11-18 10:09:28,They have 3 firsts I'd want one of them or a prospect equivalent like Molendyk.
flyers,lxsi22b,2024-11-18 13:05:48,Hm so it turns out getting on Reddit completely yammed out on flu meds is a stupid idea. Man I really did think up a trade scenario for buffalo Sabres Dylan Cozens and totally Buffalo Sabres David Jiricek didn’t I. Wow. I think I’ve had cozens on my mind I’m leaving it up so people can laugh at the dumbass. Good call out. I’m going to bed lol
flyers,lxrwnto,2024-11-18 11:17:34,I’d do it
flyers,lxri1vy,2024-11-18 09:58:00,What about Frost + Bonk?
flyers,lxri9qi,2024-11-18 09:59:16,Isn't he having trouble staying in their lineup? Not to mention Columbus is second to last in the Eastern Conference standings. I don't think they have much leverage. I could be wrong and yes defensemen take longer to develop but Frost can hopefully provide some offense to their team and replace a guy that's played 5 of the last 10 games with an assist and -2 +/-
flyers,lxshqyp,2024-11-18 13:04:15,What? A package of Rasmus Ristolainen and Morgan Frost has significantly more value than a package of Jamie Drysdale and a future 2nd round pick. The difference is that Briere was specifically looking for futures whereas Columbus may be looking for impact players right now. But you can’t tell me that Risto and Frost is a worse package than Anaheim’s version of Drysdale and their 2nd rounder.
flyers,lxs2s5c,2024-11-18 11:49:00,And Risto was drafted 8 OA *just* 11 years ago lol.But seriously players valuations change over the years.       Risto has been on an upswing lately while Jiricek has been on the downswing. Would Risto straight up get a late first right now or at the TDL?The Flyers desperately need a 1D for the future and a 1C right now.          They have some small hope that York Drysdale or Bonk (maybe not Andrae) might become a 1D.        They literally have no hope right now for a 1C except for the small chance of Luchanko getting there one day.
flyers,lxtexr4,2024-11-18 15:51:38,We didnt get a top 5 pick for Gauthier and had to settle for a pretty lackluster package. If CBJ is forced to trade they won't get a top 5 pick back.
flyers,lxripct,2024-11-18 10:01:46,What about Frost + Bonk?
flyers,lxrwc97,2024-11-18 11:15:53,I see what you’re saying but Jarmo isn’t their GM anymore. Don Waddell was the complete opposite in Carolina
flyers,lxryojw,2024-11-18 11:28:06,Kekalainen isn't CBJs gm anymore.
flyers,lxs8yve,2024-11-18 12:20:24,Yeah the only thing that might drive up the price a little bit is if there’s enough of a market to start a bidding war. But even then it won’t be as astronomical as people are picturing. Fans tend to assume that it takes years and years for a guy’s value to change. They still view Jiricek as a player who has the hype to go 6th overall (or higher) in the 2022 draft. But there have been 2.5 years of hockey played since then and perceptions of Jiricek have likely changed in that time.
flyers,lxs18di,2024-11-18 11:41:11,Ok but. You pick someone high and they don’t turn out. Then you expect to be able to flip that mistake for another first rounder? That also seems delusional. I get saying that teams aren’t going to give someone away for nothing most of the time when that someone was supposed to have potential. But you also can’t expect to make a miss on a pick and then recoup most of what you lost all of the time. So far he’s a miss. I don’t think you need to overpay for a miss. Teams overpay for guys who are showing something like a first for Walker.
flyers,lxt8ez0,2024-11-18 15:18:39,I think our fans extremely over value Tyson Foerster. In 3 years time is he going to be any better of a player than Joel Farabee? I personally don't think so. He had every opportunity last year which is why he hit 20 goals. This year Michkov is getting those minutes and opportunities and Foerster is severely underperforming vs. last year. If including Foerster in a trade lands us a top RHD or a young 1/2C im all over it.
flyers,lxt9i14,2024-11-18 15:24:10,I think there is a pretty low chance of Jiricek being a top pair Dman. There is this myth that you can’t tell if a Dman will be elite or not until they are like 23 but the data on aging curves shows that Dman age pretty similarly to forwards.You can tell when a guy is going to be truly elite by the time they are 20-21 in the significant majority of cases. So far Jiricek has shown nothing at the NHL level to indicate that he will be special. He has major limitations in his mobility on the defensive side of the puck and hasn’t shown the IQ to be able to make up for it. He’a big and mean and has puck skills and above average forward and lateral mobility for his size   It means nothing if he can’t improve his rush defense and anticipate the game at the NHL level because he does not move well backwards or pivoting at all and in order to compensate for that he needs to be ahead of the play he’s hyper aggressive its a bad combo in my opinion. Reminds me way too much of Phil Myers.At least with forester you have a season long sample of him being one of the best defensive forwards in the NHL and being able to score goals at a very good rate for his age I think it would be crazy to give up that potential for a project like Jiricek just because of a slow start/potential sophomore slump.
flyers,lxrv2p0,2024-11-18 11:09:15,Well they don’t need 5 Cs so someone’s gotta be available for a price lol
flyers,lxrld13,2024-11-18 10:16:52,He doesn't want to play in the AHL for Columbus but maybe he does with us? I think part of his reasoning for wanting to move to the NHL is because he sees guys ahead of him whom he believes are worse. Jack Johnson being one.
flyers,lxs6mkj,2024-11-18 12:08:34,Is there a reason CBJ hasn't played hardball with him then seeing as he's under contract? It's not like he has a choice about being assigned to the AHL.  Seems to me they would be well within their rights to fine him and toll his contract in those circumstances.
flyers,lxs8wrk,2024-11-18 12:20:06,They still lack a #1D even if that trade went through.  Sanheim can hold his own as a top pairing against average and lower teams but against good or better teams he's over matched and especially against teams with a good forecheck.  York is IMO the best defender on the team but he's not a 1D either.  Drysdale is MIA/incomplete due to injuries frankly I think he's done as an everyday player.  Andre is very good but a little undersized and will get exploited on that but he's a 4D.  Jiricek is also a malcontent in Columbus so why bother with Gauthier the 2nd?Sure center is their biggest weakness but I don't look at their defense as a strength.  It's just not as glaring.
flyers,lxrmoy4,2024-11-18 10:24:18,For Risto or Risto & Frost? Do we need another young LHD?
flyers,lxsigtj,2024-11-18 13:07:54,Ha! That makes much more sense. As someone who is obsessed with the idea of getting Dylan Cozens from Buffalo I was totally on board with finding a way to make this whole thing happen. Maybe we get Don Waddell and Kevyn Adams to take some of those flu meds and really kick this rebuild into high gear!
flyers,lxrkbkb,2024-11-18 10:11:00,You are ignoring what other teams will offer. Jiricek was the 6th OA pick 2 years ago and makes less than a million which means the majority of the league can fit him on their roster and would be making offers for him.  A 1 for 1 with Frost as the return doesn't get it done when other teams will offer significantly more.
flyers,lxspq85,2024-11-18 13:44:25,I would argue the value of drysdale and a second is overwhelmingly higher than risto and frost. Drysdale could develop and risto is having one good season after a bunch of mediocrity at best. I think it’s logical to compare the value of jiricek to cutters given their similarities. Nothing about Columbus’ makeup or trajectory tells me they believe they are one ristolainen and frost away from competing. I might be wrong.
flyers,lxswqr8,2024-11-18 14:19:25,if the flyers could get even a 2nd rounder for ristolainen he wouldn't be on the team anymore
flyers,lxtkht5,2024-11-18 16:19:31,Drysdale was a 6th OA two years before Gauthier went 5th. And I never said CBJ would get a top 5 pick back. I said I think they would ask for the Flyers’ first rounder which will likely be in the 12-16 range.
flyers,lxrpn1b,2024-11-18 10:40:20,I think you’re actually getting pretty close with this offer.
flyers,lxrxuf2,2024-11-18 11:23:46,I don't want to see Bonk traded but that's probably a close offer.
flyers,lxs4pdy,2024-11-18 11:58:43,He's 20 years old way too early to call him a miss lol
flyers,lxu35w7,2024-11-18 17:57:16,I'm not sure I fully agree with this. I think you're right that he should 100% be available for a C or D but I think his defensive acumen size and shot put him as a more enticing long term piece for the org than any one of Farabee Brink Tippett etc.
flyers,lxu2tsg,2024-11-18 17:55:24,You're argument is pretty fair even though I don't agree with parts of it. I would be inclined to agree that he probably isn't going to be an elite player all things said and done but I still think him developing into a top pairing player is very much in the cards. I'd call above average AHL results and an acceptably performed NHL stint 2 years post-draft to be pretty above-average results. I'm willing to give him a slight pass on how this season has gone just because there's very obviously something wrong behind the scenes there. My personal opinion watching him is that his puck skills and offensive instincts are above average and his shot is elite (like genuinely Dobson/Bouchard level). The biggest concern I'd agree with is the defensive side of his game but I'm a believer in Shaw and his ability to work with players and for comparison I like Jiricek's upside more than Drysdales.
flyers,lxrmek2,2024-11-18 10:22:43,And Erik Johnson would be ahead of him here. If he needs to develop more in the AHL but doesn’t agree then that wouldn’t change here. This is literally the Cutter situation. The only way we’d make the trade is if he slots immediately into the NHL lineup which per all the reporting out of Columbus he’s not ready for.
flyers,lxry6jy,2024-11-18 11:25:32,Hes a 20 yr old who has been bad in NHL ... the fact he thinks he can refuse AHL and call out his team for playing vets like Johnson is insane.If you read any CBJ fan takes on Jiricek they all see he deserves to be scratched and doesnt look NHL ready.This isnt some incredible young player who is being mistreated and just wants out.Its a huge diva who is making huge demands even tho hes 20 and *not good* in NHL so far.
flyers,lxsetkx,2024-11-18 12:49:36,same reason Briere/Jones panicked on Gauthier and arguably preemptively pulled the trigger on a mediocre return... if/when he refuses to report and you're at a public stalemate then the perception is that you have to trade him (perceived lost leverage) at a discount.
flyers,lxsdg6f,2024-11-18 12:42:47,There is still a lot of this season left but i genuinely think Sanheim is becoming a #1 dman. York a genuine #2/1B. Drysdale a solid PP QB. A lot of season left a lot of tests against good teams especially once playoff implications are in play but I am optimistic. Could absolutely go a different direction. But if Jiricek isn’t the answer either than why target him?
flyers,lxro28u,2024-11-18 10:31:46,For Risto alone. He should get the equivalent of a 1st. We need all the young talent we can get. It's way too early to be overthinking about the handedness of D prospects. RHDs are universally preferred but an LHD should not dissuade us.
flyers,lxsrfre,2024-11-18 13:52:53,Risto is on his third good season in a row. He has been very solid since Torts and Shaw came in with the exception of the injuries of course. He is a significantly better defenseman than Drysdale is and while Drysdale *could* develop into something good how many teams are lining up for a shot at making that happen? We have our inherent biases as fans because Frost has been frustrating and because the circumstances that brought Risto to Philly were the result of an inept General Manager. But if you offered teams their choice between Risto + Frost or Drysdale + 2nd round pick I bet you the large majority of the league would be more interested in the former than the latter.
flyers,lxs54ya,2024-11-18 12:00:55,Yeah. I’m not saying he’s fully a bust. I’m just saying a draft pick is taking a flyer on a player. At the point you’ve seen the player and decided you want to let go of the player you’ve decided it was a “miss” for your needs. It just seems like in negotiations the buyers would have the leverage there.
flyers,lxu8wva,2024-11-18 18:30:16,I’m also pretty low on Drysdale so don’t really disagree there.I agree with your evaluation of Jiricek too I just think Forester has shown more at the NHL level from a process standpoint and my general stance is that all things being equal forwards are more impactful than D-men and while there are a handful of #1 D-men who are transcendent drivers of play who change that equation but Jiricek is almost certainly not one of those guys.  So if I have a choice between a guy who may end up as a good top 6 forward vs a guy who may end up a good top 4 D I am going with the forward every time.
flyers,lxsssvi,2024-11-18 13:59:38,Sanheim doesn't play well against the better teams and has a lot of trouble against teams with a good forecheck especially Carolina.  He's 28 he's peaked.  Nothing wrong with being a #3 but he's not a #1 or 2 and never will be.Drysdale hasn't shown much on the PP and that doesn't change because he's been injured or not even before the injury he wasn't effective on the PP Andre looks better than Drysdale.I wouldn't want Jiricek either never said so.  I don't see defense on the Flyers as a position of strength.
flyers,lxrqh82,2024-11-18 10:44:50,~~That's a really high possible return for a Risto deal. A first + a former first rounder.~~ ~~Do you think he's played that well to warrant that type of a return? For argument sake Sergachev got Geekie Moser a 2nd and 7th. I'd say he's much better than Risto. Hanafin got a 1st 3rd and Miromanov.~~~~Not sure the Preds would do a first + former 1st round pick but maybe based on term/control and if we sent another pick there way with Risto?~~
flyers,lxsudjw,2024-11-18 14:07:35,Yeah I completely disagree. I would think Columbus believes they can grab a player of whatever risto’s value on the free agent market. I also see plenty of young centers on Columbus’ depth chart that slot ahead of frost. At least there is hope for drysdale. Also a GM should think he can do better with an early second round draft pick than a 25 year old offense only guy whose peak so far is less than 50 points that was drafted around in a similar spot. Are you saying that the Flyers wouldn’t unload frost for a late first/early second rounder in a heart beat?
flyers,lxs5pe0,2024-11-18 12:03:51,Buyers certainly have the leverage but there are 30 buyers. We aren't bidding against Columbus we're bidding against the rest of the league and you better believe every single team in the league is at least kicking the tires on a 20-year old RHD who was a top-10 pick 2 years ago. Somebody will certainly offer CBJ a better deal than Risto/Frost and yeah there's a good chance someone puts a first in their deal
flyers,lxrqt3k,2024-11-18 10:46:35,Sorry just read you said 1st ***or*** prospect equivalent.
flyers,lxszdaq,2024-11-18 14:32:34,I’m more saying that in general a package of Risto and Frost has significantly more value than a package of Drysdale and a 2nd. Whether or not Risto and Frost would meet Columbus’s specific needs as a return for this specific player I’m not sure. I can’t picture them wanting Drysdale and a 2nd but maybe they would have little need for someone like Frost. Regardless I think you’re understating the comparative value of those two packages. Sure maybe a GM hopes that they can turn a 2nd into a better player than Frost but I would hope a GM is smart enough to know that the large majority of 2nd round picks turn into players who are *less* successful than Frost is. That’s just the reality of drafting. Meanwhile Risto is a proven Top 4 defenseman while Drysdale is a guy who might get there one day with lots of coaching. However easy you think it is to get a Risto type in free agency it’s even easier to get a guy who can replicate Drysdale’s contributions at this stage. Maybe that changes in two years if Brad Shaw does fix Drysdale but that’s a long way off. Lastly I’m not sure what your point is about the Flyers being willing to trade Frost for a 1st or 2nd round pick. Like he’s a player who doesn’t fit with the coach and is fast approaching free agency. Of course the Flyers would take a nice return for him. That doesn’t mean that Frost wouldn’t carry some value elsewhere in the league.
flyers,lxs68w3,2024-11-18 12:06:37,Yeah I suppose it’s like poker. You can bluff it all the way but you also need to know when to fold ‘em. You don’t get surplus value by overpaying but you also don’t get surplus value if you never take a chance on a guy who “isn’t working out.” I guess it always comes down to trusting your scouts and your player development team.
flyers,lxt7ndo,2024-11-18 15:14:40,I feel like it’s a pretty straightforward comparison within the conversation we’re having of comparing two specific sets of assets - one including Morgan frost and one including an early second round pick - and I disagree but fair points.
flyers,lxs9xpc,2024-11-18 12:25:13,If the Flyers scouts think Jiricek has \~the same ceiling he had in 2022 I'd absolutely move one of the back-end first round picks for him. You still have two first-rounders and 5 in the top 45. If they think he's deteriorated don't overpay.
flyers,lxrlkwo,2024-11-18 10:18:07,Don't be disappointed if Berglund's stats aren't fantastic last I heard he was playing on the 4th line with no PP time after being promoted to a tough league (SHL) against strong opposition.He has scored 1g & 2a in 14gp since being promoted to the SHL.       His team Farjestad is currently tied for 5th out of 14. They are only 4 points back of first place.

He’s absolutely one of the best players on a loaded knights team. Happy to see that bounce back. Also I know we’re all on the Zavragin wagon but can we give some flowers to Bjarnasson?  He’s definitely making a case for 1G at world juniors for Canada

flyers,lxs6eoi,2024-11-18 12:07:27,Bonk I could see making the 2026 roster. Ryan Ellis Ristolainen contracts end in 2026. Drysdale and Zamula both come off in 2025 and can’t see them both resigning so there should be room on the back end for a Bonk.
flyers,lxs93gs,2024-11-18 12:21:02,What sticks out to me is Bjarnasan's sv% of 920 is pretty great for a guy completely ignored compared to Zav's awesome year.I always liked Ciernik's speed. He has had a couple concussions in the last 2 years. Hopefully it doesn't mean he won't pan out like Pascal Leberge after his concussions.
flyers,lxsvllq,2024-11-18 14:13:41,The majority of Jett's points have come just in the last 5 games too. I think he had 1 assist in the first 3 games just getting readjusted to juniors and his team again. Also had a 4 point game against London but still a really impressive 5 game run.

flyers,lxrjz8y,2024-11-18 10:09:04,If he can develop a good shot he has an outside chance of being a 1C. Super impressed with what he’s doing and think sending him down was the best thing for his career.
flyers,lxu7bwv,2024-11-18 18:21:07,I know I am an annoying stickler w/ this stuff but I wouldnt say 11 pts in 8 junior games is *great* for a 1st round pickHes supposed to score way above PPG and anything else would be a huge disappointment.  He already was above PPG last year at age 17 and that still was considered meh offense for a top 15 pick.Even bad prospects score well above PPG in juniors post draft so Luchanko is supposed to be way over PPG.
flyers,lxtmjgn,2024-11-18 16:29:48,I'm excited to see tuomaala doing well. Another speedy winger for the bottom/middle 6.Bump is going to be solid too it seems.
flyers,lxrqxqy,2024-11-18 10:47:16,Also the only D-man close to it and he's doing it in the AHL. He seems like he has a lot of potential to make it to the NHL but we'll see.
flyers,lxs6wmd,2024-11-18 12:09:59,I'm impressed his save % is as high as it is on that Wheatkings team.
flyers,lxrw23p,2024-11-18 11:14:25,Think of Farabee Brink and Cates who do you think?
flyers,lxru6pq,2024-11-18 11:04:32,You cant move a top 6 guy for him b/c hes still a long shot to become thatBut I could see him replacing somebody in bottom 6 like Brink/Laughton as 3rd line + PP2
flyers,lxsekbz,2024-11-18 12:48:19,Drysdale is a young **RFA** who we just got as main piece in Gauthier trade.They arent going to let an RFA w/ his pedigree just walk. Even if he struggles they will just sign him to another cheap *hopefully he finally breaks out bridge* deal.  Or he would be traded.  They wouldnt let him just walk tho.I doubt Zamula gets re-signed tho.Right now the Flyers dont have a single clear long term guy at RHD so Bonk should have no problem making team if he looks ready.
flyers,lxsdwge,2024-11-18 12:45:02,Ciernik was the 120th pick.  Even before the concussions he was a long shot to be an NHL regular.
flyers,lxsg4cr,2024-11-18 12:56:04,Bjarnasson definitely has good numbers that are worth recognizing.  Yet isn't Zavgarin playing against tougher competition?  I suspect that this is why he gets more (all of the) recognition.
flyers,lxu888q,2024-11-18 18:26:19,I dont think we should even be discussing him potentially being a 1C until he shows a lot more.  Right now hes a B level non blue chip prospect that many project as middle lineup/3rd line due to concerns about offensive ceiling.We gotta lower our expectations and hope he can just be a good top 6 center.
flyers,lxrt57k,2024-11-18 10:58:59,Bonks back in Juniors

flyers,lxsj3om,2024-11-18 13:11:08,Barkey was the 95th pick. Lindblom was the 138th.It's fun to hope a long shot makes good.Ciernik was my long shot hope bc of his speed.     Carter Sotheran is another bc of his indigenous roots. I loved Reggie Leach.    Bump is another bc of his name. I wanna see him on the ice at the same time as Bonk.

flyers,lxtoois,2024-11-18 16:40:41,Because he can walk after next season with 0 return?  I was thinking Farabee to get some cap relief and Cates so they wouldn't have to resign him.  Brink is to inconsistent and small.
flyers,lxuarmy,2024-11-18 18:41:04,>Because he can walk after next season with 0 return? Moreso b/c hes 30 not good and has value on trade market.  Guys like Cates and Poehling can do his job while being younger and cheaper.  Also clears a spot for someone like Tuomaala.>I was thinking Farabee to get some cap reliefThey dont need cap relief. I could see him being traded but it wouldnt be for cap relief.  It would entirely be about the return getting a key piece back like like one of a 1st young center or top 4 D.Cates is perfect for 4th line and would be cheap to re-sign so I dont see why they wouldnt. Genuinely good defensive 4th liners that post positive metrics drive play and can play center are valuable.Brink is signed another year but if he doesnt improve this year I think hes done.  I dont think Laughton or Frost will be on team next year either.

The problem is he hasn't been able to finish any of the opportunities he's been creating for himself.

Rubstov has played least amount of NHL games out of every guy taken in that 1st round.Then took Laberge 36th (pick after Kyrou and 3 picks b4 Debrincat) Hart 48th Allison 52nd (Hronek was next pick) and then Twarynski Bunnaman Hogberg Laczynski Salinitri ...0/8 on skaters even being NHLers despite taking 3 skaters in 1st 2 roundsThe draft actually looked pretty good pretty soon after when Allison Bunnaman Hogberg and Laczynski all had good years soon after.Also a perfect example of not putting too much stock in scoring well in juniors.  Twarynski Bunnaman Laberge Salintiri all had impressive scoring seasons there.

They no longer have their goalie tandem after trading Ullmark trading away picks to keep making playoff runs has left them with no prospects of note and they have little depth.  Oh Marchand is 36 and aging fast this year.They're going down a similar path Philly is just a couple years behind.
flyers,lxryyec,2024-11-18 11:29:31,I saw someone say a week or 2. I think.
flyers,lxru0na,2024-11-18 11:03:37,I suspect whatever his concerns were have long since blown over by now.  On the personal side I presume he has settled into a stable environment and if his objective really is being an NHL netminder he has to see that there are few places that offer a better opportunity right now than Philly.  Even if he has to take a step back and spend some time in the AHL I assume he can now see the pathway and knows that he’s still right on the doorstep.  Having seen the NHL talent he has to know that this is where he needs to be developing whether it’s with the big club or not.  Frankly I will have big time concerns about him if he still wants to go play in the KHL.
flyers,lxt5qrl,2024-11-18 15:04:50,It’s like the Michigan but from the other side. Permission to dub this new move the Yooper

flyers,lxrw8gm,2024-11-18 11:15:20,Yeah then there's a much bigger issue since he's getting NHL time and the Flyers are clearly high on him.

flyers,lxr4f16,2024-11-18 08:32:55,My goodness I'm so happy for this kid to have his old man in town.  I bet the Russian dinner was amazing for all their spirits.  And I think everyone should read Shaw's comments on the player because big Z seems to be misunderstood around here. Shaw of course recognizes what makes Z a unique player in the league.  His poise and ability to slow a play down is a rare trait and not one that really jumps off the screen. I'm of the opinion that Z is a very offensively instincted player.  This makes his development as a defender a longer and more tedious process from a coaching standpoint but I think if you get this kid's defense dialed in he will give you savvy offensive plays all over the ice that you that you don't typically get out of Dmen of his size.
flyers,lxrjdzv,2024-11-18 10:05:42,His offensive game already translates at the NHL if he can get stronger and faster he can be a force.
flyers,lxnk6ex,2024-11-17 16:24:29,In the infamous words of Torts “he’s a toilet seat: sometimes he’s up sometimes he’s down. He’s down now”

flyers,lxnhiue,2024-11-17 16:09:59,I'm riding it out this year. I don't see any real value in waiving him and if all he's gonna get is say a 5th I'd rather take the chance and see if he can rebound. The year is still young. Ultimately though his ceiling is probably as a C3. Not really sure even last year suggested any much more.
flyers,lxnntik,2024-11-17 16:44:25,Frost is likely never going to reach his ceiling. It sucks but is what it is. But the Flyers are playing it smart so far. He’s an RFA so his production is directly tied to his future earnings. So we have a player with potential who doesn’t cost anything. If we trade him we get nothing right now. If we don’t resign him we get nothing. Get used to having him for 2-3 more years and hope he can get better. Because that’s what’s likely going to happen.
flyers,lxnj1ev,2024-11-17 16:18:14,Cool dude. Is no doubt talented. Inconsistent in his play.
flyers,lxnhxsy,2024-11-17 16:12:15,I think he’s a guy that has all the tools and zero of the hockey IQ to put it together on this team. He could potentially have a nice career not on the flyers but I’ve seen enough to stop even remotely listening to the “but he’s actually amazing” guys on this sub.I think he’s a great candidate for the typical “failed prospect for failed prospect” trade.
flyers,lxnhycw,2024-11-17 16:12:20,I’m tired of watching him suck for the first 25 games and then watch him be mediocre for the rest of the season then convincing myself that “next year he will have a good start and produce the way he should.” He sucks.
flyers,lxnmuhr,2024-11-17 16:39:05,Going into this season I thought this team had to make a choice between him or Brink. Understandably they play different positions but a team only has so much room for inconsistent type players which both Frost & Brink fall under. I honestly thought Frost would’ve gotten the edge over Brink but Brink seems to have really put in work this off season and looks a lot more reliable than Frost. Time will tell still plenty of games for Frost to prove himself again.
flyers,lxntfdn,2024-11-17 17:15:17,This season made it very clear he has no future here and definitely doesnt deserve another season to prove himself.But you cant send him down either.  He should be traded since he should have solid value as a 25 yr old center coming off multiple 40+ pt seasons.It will be interesting to see what they could get for him.
flyers,lxohooe,2024-11-17 19:34:47,his skill set is meant to be a top 6 forward. unfortunately his skills are not high enough to consistently score at that rate in the NHL. and he’s not someone who can transition in to a bottom line grinding role. that’s just not his game. he’s kinda a tweener and would absolutely put up points in the AHL. his skill just isn’t elite enough to produce in the NHL.
flyers,lxnj351,2024-11-17 16:18:29,It's a shame he isn't working out because he has a really cool hockey name.
flyers,lxnoc1v,2024-11-17 16:47:14,It’s not a good sign for him that we have looked great in the 2 games he was scratched and when he subbed in for coots we were awful….i think he can be a really creative assist guy on the right team that plays a style that fits him and can deal with his below average defense 
flyers,lxnhdz3,2024-11-17 16:09:15,I think he looks like absolute shit.
flyers,lxnji7i,2024-11-17 16:20:49,This is what he is. If you're OK with that then great. I'm not. Cut bait
flyers,lxnigr3,2024-11-17 16:15:06,Trade bait. He’ll be playing in Europe within 3 years
flyers,lxnxd9w,2024-11-17 17:37:14,Frost might not be a part of the future but calling him a below NHL level player is a bit far. He’s fine on a 3rd line. He’s just not someone we want to keep in a 2nd line role
flyers,lxnpdcz,2024-11-17 16:52:55,Probably better than he plays in our system. He'll flourish at some point I just don't see it happening in the Metro under Torts 
flyers,lxnmvyi,2024-11-17 16:39:18,I was a big fan of Frost hoped on his upside and was critical of Torts last year for benching him. I am so done with him. I would trade him for pennies on the dollar just to never think about him any more.
flyers,lxnjwhw,2024-11-17 16:22:58,He is absolutely fast enough skilled enough maybe his awareness is where he falls short also he can’t finish for shit. But neither can 95% of this team…I wouldn’t be surprised if he goes to an actual capable team and flourishes like so many players before him have. He’s had countless chances early in the season and hasn’t been able to bury any of them.
flyers,lxnjyx3,2024-11-17 16:23:21,He started Torts tenure in Philly reasonably strong and it had me thinking he was going to produce regularly. Unfortunately I think this is peak Morgan Frost.
flyers,lxnnhmg,2024-11-17 16:42:36,I really just think his time has passed here and he needs a change of scenery to give him a shot.  It's not happening here.But he's not worth much at the moment either.  Best we could do is another team's reclamation project or a low-end pick.
flyers,lxnur1m,2024-11-17 17:22:34,I would see if Boston would be down for a Frost-Frederic swap I think stylistically it could make sense for both teams
flyers,lxo1lel,2024-11-17 18:01:27,Bro has been “developing” for far too long.   He is what he is.  And he’s not good enough.  If we can get a bag of pucks for him I’ll take it.
flyers,lxo2rol,2024-11-17 18:08:13,Best case scenario someone offer sheets him this off season and we get a pick back. Saw someone else say he starts off every year flat then plays mediocre (which makes it seem better) and we’re all left hoping next year he figures it out for good. It’s time to move on. It’s insane to keep hoping he figures it out here when he’s proved he can’t.
flyers,lxnqrji,2024-11-17 17:00:30,I feel like even if he had the high end skill of a Mitch Marner or something we’d still be complaining about him as a “hockey player” and whether or not he’s someone you can win with. He’s kinda built like those types with less “wow” in his game.Overall I like him. He seems like a great dude and he’s been through a decent amount of shit with this team and still wants to be here. But all in all… he’s probably a good 3C on a scoring third line.Which is fine… if your front office thinks that’s more valuable than a hard-nosed vet 3C with size and sandpaper.Issue is… I don’t think we are the kind of team that wants to roll a mini-scoring line of Farabee-Frost-Brink. So if a 28 year old 3C is available in free agency who hits and blocks shots etc… I could see us signing them and moving Frost if his next contract negotiation isn’t a steal for us.
flyers,lxo9z6m,2024-11-17 18:50:35,He's 25 now. He's past the point where you'd expect him to grow into a better player. He is who he is and what he is is a small offensively-oriented center who is a less than 0.5 PPG player in his 6th NHL season. He can't play on the penalty kill he has two primary assists so far this year (both of which were on the power play) and he's scored zero goals with his stick in 16 games. He seems like a nice kid but again he's 25 now and it looks like we've seen his ceiling. If they can flip him for any kind of assets they absolutely should because I don't see him as a piece on a team that seriously wants to win.
flyers,lxnjwhq,2024-11-17 16:22:58,Honestly he’s probably better suited to wing. I think Torts places a lot of defensive and structure responsibilities on C which is why he sometimes looks lost. The problem is that there’s a bit of a glut at W and while we appear thin at centre we’re actually not. Coots plays a solid 2-way game Laughts and Poehling bring decent speed and a 2-way game -and Cates is solid defensively. These guys play Torts brand hockey which is grindy structure-based “north-south”. Frosty is fancy. He’s creative and elusive. But where do you put him when Brink and Foerster are heavy forecheckers that play the system reasonably well and make plays? TK is our #1 Meech our #2 and Tip is probably our #3 with Farabee maybe our #4 winger. That leaves 2 wing spots (after Brink and Foerster) and Hathaway is an everyday player on the bottom 6. Hath is an absolute dog. So that leaves one spot and Tony Dick rn is a better player than Frost. If Tony Dick’s play drops off I’d try Frosty on the Wing and use him at C in a pinch if one of our others gets hurt. Frosty is trade-bait for sure.
flyers,lxnw73u,2024-11-17 17:30:38,Frost has had periods of good play and periods where he's struggled.  So have most of our core players including Farabee Foerster Brink Cates and Tippett.  So has the entire rest of the team (apart from Travis Konecny maybe).  I don't know what it is about Frost that makes some fans judge him so much more harshly than any of these other players.    We're not contending this year anyway so there's no rush to make decisions on anyone. He'll be no harder to trade in the offseason or next offseason than he is today so they may as well give him the chance to bloom late whether we intend to trade him or keep him.
flyers,lxnxc20,2024-11-17 17:37:02,Too soft and barely a 3C. Trade him for whatever. His value is pretty minimal but not interested in continuing with this experiment.
flyers,lxnmw00,2024-11-17 16:39:19,I think he’s another guy on a long list of players we have that are complimentary pieces. Frost is no doubt talented but he needs help to actually produce. We have a million of those guys and one- MAYBE two- player who can truly drive a line.
flyers,lxnpuyc,2024-11-17 16:55:34,Low end 3C. Not sure what you could get for him and we don’t have any centers.
flyers,lxnv2rw,2024-11-17 17:24:24,I think we've seen enough to know what we have in Frost.....I don't think he wears a Flyers jersey next season.
flyers,lxogv3s,2024-11-17 19:29:59,Alright time to give it to you guys straight. The flyers have undoubtedly the flyers cheap version of Daniel Sprong.
flyers,lxnl44y,2024-11-17 16:29:36,Start of this season has definitely been the worst hockey he's ever played in the NHL. In my opinion this has been the first time he's actually deserved to be a healthy scratch. Definitely becoming clear it's not going to work out with him and Torts. He probably just can't play C in a way Torts wants. But I will not be surprised if he becomes a good 3 C for some other team. I think the organisation fucked up a bit with this situation. It was probably always clear to Torts that Frost is on thin ice with him so they should've looked for a trade. His value has certainly tanked by now.
flyers,lxnm30b,2024-11-17 16:34:55,Imagine keeping Schenn not taking on Lehtera and just drafting Heiskanen and K’Andre Miller (maybe Farabee is still on the board) with the picks we had anyway.
flyers,lxnhr43,2024-11-17 16:11:14,My thoughts on Frost are that I do not care if he breaks out on his next team I am sick of seeing him on this team.
flyers,lxnvxzu,2024-11-17 17:29:14,He’s just a dude.
flyers,lxo0jpn,2024-11-17 17:55:27,"The only personly im still ""holding hope for"" is Tippett.. Maybe foerester. If it gets us picks or prospects then move on from farabee frost brink laughton"
flyers,lxocpi8,2024-11-17 19:06:25,I think frost has the skills to be an nhl player. His biggest struggle is consistency especially with confidence. No he shouldn’t go to the AHL. Will he get traded probably not and if it does happen it wont be a win for the flyers. Frost will probably play out his contract and the flyers will move on or will be signed for his current performance history if they need a depth center because they don’t have someone to replace him at the time of negotiations. I see the flyers as a perennial mid tier team until they decide to be a bottom 3-5 team to add more prospect depth. No one is signing in Philly as an FA with intentions of winning a cup vs other more likely Cup destinations and tax incentives.
flyers,lxoddph,2024-11-17 19:10:19,I do like him as a player and he definitely has potential. But I feel like him as a BIG trading piece is much more viable for this team at the moment
flyers,lxoqe1d,2024-11-17 20:27:18,He’s basically just Kevin Hayes at this point as a hockey player. High end play making skills and decent hands but zero consistency low hockey IQ and not enough drive to do anything but coast on his raw talent. He’s still a serviceable middle 6 C that’ll pot his 40-45 points. He’d probably be playing every night if he hustled harder and didn’t have Torts as his coach but he fits as poorly here stylistically/culturally as Hayes did. I’m sure some team with 0 secondary center depth will give him a nice contract at some point like we did for Hayes but it ain’t happening here. He’s not the type of player Torts wants to build around. Hopefully we can either trade him for another young project center (KK from CAR would be an interesting swap) or maybe we can package him with a winger like Farabee to target a young C with more top 6 upside like Rossi or Zegras.
flyers,lxp0bbk,2024-11-17 21:28:32,The coach doesn't like him His value is never lower
flyers,lxpvc60,2024-11-18 01:15:05,He's got some really amazing skill but clearly doesn't have the ability to apply it. I remember being super pumped when his very first goal in the NHL was him just walking up on the net and roofing it backhand... not everyone can do that. The problem is he hasn't managed to do it again and I'm not convinced he will.
flyers,lxr7nhp,2024-11-18 08:54:10,I have never been a big fan of Frost. He does super hype beast moves then lets you down for three games. I don’t think he truly has that much trade value in all honesty so I don’t see a point trading him for like… a 4th or 5th. He is cheap enough to just let it ride out and stick along side for filler in a future trade if we want. Plus we have no other centreman worth a damn so. Eh
flyers,lxrcocs,2024-11-18 09:25:56,Softer than baby shit. Good chance he doesn't sign anywhere and plays the rest of his days in Europe. The guy is a passenger and absolutely afraid of physicality
flyers,lxrzch1,2024-11-18 11:31:33,Trade him!  He doesn't fit this team/Tortorella and won't.  Regardless he's their best center doesn't matter.  No player ever helped a team from the bench.  Get what they can and move on.
flyers,lxrzhye,2024-11-18 11:32:20,Out on Frost know there's talent somewhere will not be here
flyers,lxsab0s,2024-11-18 12:27:05,I want to like him. But his play makes that really hard right now.Emphasis on right now.He can be good bad players don't put up 40+ points in the NHL often. I'm not an nhl coach I'm not gonna pretend to know what the current issue is. Maybe a nagging injury. Maybe nothing. Maybe something else.Right now you let him ride. He's a RFA. See where he is at the TDL. See what the market is. Maybe he turns it around (again). But if he doesn't he should be gone before our first selection at the next draft. If he turns it around he's fine for now. We're not winning the cup next year either.
flyers,lxsg05d,2024-11-18 12:55:30,This team is very week at center. No we should not be trading one of the few centers we have
flyers,lxsy8cv,2024-11-18 14:26:51,TRADE NOW
flyers,lxnq7tg,2024-11-17 16:57:30,"I find it interesting how Frost Tippett Farabee are all kind of in the same boat and how the perception drastically changes depending on who you ask.Tippett has games where he looks like the best player on the ice but then has 3 weeks where you don't notice him. I find that far more frustrating.I also find it funny when people genuinely believe Frost is complete trash. You may not like him or the ""brand of hockey"" he plays but I've literally seen people in gamethreads saying he's destined to play in Europe in the next couple years.Overall I like Frost and if he sticks around longterm as our 3C I have no issues with that.I'm also cool using Brink Farabee Frost as potential pieces to be a part of a move to get a center."
flyers,lxnjn7r,2024-11-17 16:21:34,he just doesn’t have any elite tools in his arsenal and he lacks any real defensive skills to mitigate the fact that he’s more than likely a 50 point ceiling kind of guy. i think there’s a place in the league for him but it feels like we have a lot of players that can be good not great and i’m not sure morgan frost is one of those guys that makes the cut.
flyers,lxol9g9,2024-11-17 19:56:02,Cheap centre until draft picks break into the league.
flyers,lxnktbh,2024-11-17 16:27:58,I don't think about him at all.  Nice kid (probably) but there's no fit. He's not a 2C on a Stanley Cup contender and he's not a 3C or 4C style wise either. I dont know who would even want him
flyers,lxnmb7r,2024-11-17 16:36:10,I think he and Torts are just a bad match and I give him a lot of credit for being a team player throughout that relationship. Ultimately while we desperately need centers I really hope he gets a chance to go elsewhere next season and see if a change of scenery helps him have a more productive NHL career.
flyers,lxnjedo,2024-11-17 16:20:13,Stinks.
flyers,lxniknc,2024-11-17 16:15:40,He def doesnt fit here. We needed to trade him before but torts tanked his value. Maybe we can do a hockey trade for another guy and convince the other team he needs a fresh start
flyers,lxo7518,2024-11-17 18:34:00,He will bounce back and contribute eventually if we give him a chance. No need to sell low.
flyers,lxnqwl1,2024-11-17 17:01:16,"You probably said the same thing about Sanheim when he was 25. Most Flyers fans did. ""Talented but very inconsistent and doesn't seem to have a high compete level."" Sanheim didn't ""get it"" until age 27. I'm waiting it out on Frost. But his contract ends this July so they'll have to make a decision."
flyers,lxoqxap,2024-11-17 20:30:34,He’s the only center we currently have that has any offensive potential. I’d rather move on from cates than frost because cates fills a defensive bottom 6 center spot that we already have covered with 3 other centers in Laughton poeling and coots.We don’t know what luchenko will eventually be but he’s most likely several years away before we actually start seeing that player. I’d be looking for a top center in this draft if we pick in the top 5-8
flyers,lxnztbo,2024-11-17 17:51:13,Just another prospect that doesnt pan out. this is on the Management. It clear they dont know how to develop talent. Gagne Giroux Carter Richards... name me more if you can but that is 4 guys in 30 years.
flyers,lxow8xv,2024-11-17 21:03:18,Did he actually say this that's fucking wild lmao. I'd never recover if a coach called me a toilet seat
flyers,lxntip2,2024-11-17 17:15:48,>Trade him.What if all of the available players we can trade him for are worse?
flyers,lxnj1vu,2024-11-17 16:18:18,So we can wait til game 42… got it/s
flyers,lxo1eml,2024-11-17 18:00:23,Yep and the problem is you look around at other 3Cs in the league and he’s not even a great option there… definitely a disappointment considering him and beezer joined the team with such high ceilings
flyers,lxoodas,2024-11-17 20:14:55,Qualifying him would be a mistake
flyers,lxogbfv,2024-11-17 19:26:58,Talented in the way that anyone else is that has made it to the NHL that's about it man.
flyers,lxnylx5,2024-11-17 17:44:22,He shows flashes of brilliance on the puck which keeps people coming back. He's like golf. Crazy frustrating until that one sweet 7 iron that lands 3 ft from the hole. Makes you think wow I can be good at this if I keep playing
flyers,lxnzo7b,2024-11-17 17:50:24,I agree with this he needs a change of scenery and probably needs to find the perfect fit in terms of linemates system and coach in order to succeed in the NHL. I could see him being a 2C somewhere but it certainly won't be here.
flyers,lxniej7,2024-11-17 16:14:46,I laughed aloud reading this. So insanely accurate.
flyers,lxoq5bc,2024-11-17 20:25:50,Almost everyone on this team who’s names aren’t Sanheim Konecny and michkov are inconsistent lol
flyers,lxnr8yr,2024-11-17 17:03:13,You nailed it.The only reason I was pulling for him was so I could buy a jersey one day with FROST on the back.Oh well maybe I could still get a TONY DICK one in the future. Or a JETT one.
flyers,lxod9dw,2024-11-17 19:09:40,Exactly but he’s not good enough defensively to be what you consider a good 4th line center like you can with Laughton. So he’s not a fit for most team as a young and upcoming center usually will take the 3rd line. He kinda just hampers it by existing. (I know this sounds way harsher than I mean it to)
flyers,lxnr5hx,2024-11-17 17:02:39,"Why is our fanbase in such a hurry to move players ""just because"" when we're rebuilding? Not to single you out I just see it all over this thread and in this sub in general. People were ready to move Sanheim at all costs good thing Torey Krug put a stop to that.People wanted to move TK when he had those 2 down years for pennies on the dollar.People wanted Ghost gone at any cost.Frost isn't preventing this team from being good and trading him for the sake of trading him doesn't make sense to me.If you can use him/Brink/Farabee etc to get another piece then by all means."
flyers,lxnu36d,2024-11-17 17:18:58,"> I would trade him for pennies on the dollar just to never think about him any more.This will never stop being the ""fan opinion"" I respect the least."
flyers,lxnsd47,2024-11-17 17:09:21,I think awareness is mostly what keeps him from being a true star player. He doesn't make decisions fast enough consistently enough to get the most out of his teammates. He also kinda needs to be the one in the driver's seat of his line or he tends to float I think this is the big reason he didn't mesh with Michkov at 5v5 Michkov makes decisions really quick and drives his line.He has the skill to be in the NHL and in a different situation he is more of an asset. Like if the team had a closer to his prime Giroux closer to his prime Couturier and a strong 4C that could eat tough assignments well than having a 40 point 3C could be a real asset. But that ain't the team the Flyers are and likely won't be in that spot for a few years.
flyers,lxrzn4u,2024-11-18 11:33:06,Not a chance Frederic is a fan and team favorite he's on a reasonable contract he's not going for Frost.
flyers,lxodvn8,2024-11-17 19:13:13,The guy has played 300 professional hockey games and people still claim they don't know what this guy is.  Unbelievable.
flyers,lxool5g,2024-11-17 20:16:15,He would need to score to make that a mini scoring line
flyers,lxp6zcu,2024-11-17 22:10:25,He plays small more often than not but physically he's not small by modern NHL standards. He's significantly bigger than Rossi for example who people are fantasizing as a trade target.
flyers,lxnr2on,2024-11-17 17:02:13,I agree with this assessment.  I think Frost probably needs a change in scenery in the worst way.  I just don't think he's going to succeed if he stays here.  I think a combination of moving to a team that can make use of his skills better plus potentially a move to wing would be in his best interest in the long term.
flyers,lxnl5vi,2024-11-17 16:29:52,Yea but in general centers have more defensive responsibilities than wingers.Dude has good hands and is talented just not a good hockey player
flyers,lxo3lxp,2024-11-17 18:13:10,>Definitely becoming clear it's not going to work out with him and Torts. I don't think this is true at all.  Tortorella recognizes the progress Frost has made and respects him as much as any other veteran in the lineup.  I think people are still living way too much in last season when it comes to this dynamic.
flyers,lxodbv8,2024-11-17 19:10:03,People really did bow down at the altar of Hextall when that deal happened.  It's embarassing looking back on fans' reaction to that deal.
flyers,lxoyv73,2024-11-17 21:19:33,"He has value but hes not a ""BIG trading piece"" at this point"
flyers,lxo4cp4,2024-11-17 18:17:35,I completely agree.  The average fan's perception of Frost is weirdly irrational.  Personally I don't know what he will ultimately be but I trust Torts's and Danny's evaluations of his potential far more than anyone else's.
flyers,lxo3y8o,2024-11-17 18:15:13,">he's not a 3C or 4C style wise either.I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong but there are a lot of very smart people in hockey who would make the argument that this view of ""line-specific roles"" is totally outdated and unproductive in today's NHL."
flyers,lxnqn8z,2024-11-17 16:59:51,Watching him play reminds me of the end of Ghosts tenure here when AV would sit Ghost if he made a mistake.Torts is definitely more lenient this year but Frost *looks* like he's playing to not make a mistake rather than trying to make a play a lot of times.When he has confidence he's great when he doesn't though he can look like a shell of himself.
flyers,lxnok95,2024-11-17 16:48:28,Maybe Krebs. He doesn’t really have any value on Buffalo anymore.
flyers,lxoynjw,2024-11-17 21:18:12,>defensive bottom 6 center spot that we already have covered with 3 other centers in Laughton poeling and coots.Couts is our best C atm so is playing 1C.  And Poehling and Laughton arent that good defensively.Cates is perfect for the 4th line.  Hes a C/W hybrid who drives play and is great defensively unlike Poehling/Laughton who are both just mediocre to average defensively.Cates has posted a positive +/- in 3 of his 4 seasons despite playing very tough defensive minutes vs top lines.  Hes so good defensively that he breaks even/comes out positive vs top lines.  And he can drive play.  That is valuable.  Him and Hathaway are both very good 4th liners that drive play w/ great defense and will likely run a great 4th line for next few years.Laughton is in his 30s makes 3 mil and is a bad 5v5 player.  Id much rather keep Cates as the swiss army knife C/W bottom 6 hybrid who is actually good at 5v5/defense younger and cheaper.The problem with Frost is he isnt good enough for top 6 role but isnt really suited for a bottom 6 role.  Its pretty clear he has no long term future here at this point.Trade him and replace him w/ a better center in the offseason while also using top pick on C.
flyers,lxozjf7,2024-11-17 21:23:42,Frost was taken 27th overall and became better than most players taken that late.Id definitely add Konecny and Coutuier to that list.  Sanheim and Ghost arguably too.  Guys like Simmonds Voracek and Tippett broke out here even tho they werent drafted here.Drafting/developing hasnt been great but Frost isnt really an example as a 27th overall pick and you definitely left out top liners like TK/Couturier.

flyers,lxop1pb,2024-11-17 20:19:04,I would argue having a defensive liability that brings no offense and gets pinned in his own zone as your 2 or 3c absolutely prevents a team from being good
flyers,lxo1iqw,2024-11-17 18:01:02,What do you honestly think Frost is at this point? Hes a 3C who gets 40 points a year. He makes low hockey IQ plays and is frequently more of a liability than an asset. This is admittedly an irrational take but i dont care cause im not the GM making that move. I just hate watching him cause he feels like a waste of time. Hes not gonna develop anymore than what he is 7 years post draft. Realistically they move him in the offseason after he inevitably bounces back and gets 40 points and he gets some better value. I would be willing to give him more time with Michkov but he hasnt capitalized on it at all like i had hoped.
flyers,lxohxo4,2024-11-17 19:36:16,Dude is 25 in his 5th year of professional hockey and has looked *exactly* the same the last 3+ years at least.  What magical leap is everyone waiting for?

He’s either playing the wrong position or he’s on the wrong team. I say try him at RW where he has a better play making angle and the option of a one-timer (even though he’s not really a finisher). Give him 10-15 games. If he still isn’t cutting it trade him. 
flyers,lxohdnv,2024-11-17 19:33:00,There was like a few of us on this sub who hated it at the time and were crucified.It was bad at the time because the Flyers should've been buildin out around G and Voracek instead of planning 5 years out. And on top of that it's glaring reason #1 why you cannot rely on draft picks to save you
flyers,lxonc22,2024-11-17 20:08:37,They can argue that all they want but it doesn't make Morgan Frost anyone's preferred 3/4C.
flyers,lxnqn04,2024-11-17 16:59:49,Krebs is awful.
flyers,lxnpc0f,2024-11-17 16:52:43,"Krebs is who this sub thinks Frost is and after the novelty of the ""new guy"" wears off would be hated lol.He had 17 points last year in 80 games. 72 points in *232 games* through his career."
flyers,lxnt7nn,2024-11-17 17:14:04,Krebs is a terrible player. I don’t see any real hope of him turning into anything useful.
flyers,lxp110f,2024-11-17 21:33:00,Ideally I’d be trading Laughton. I disagree with you that he’s not very solid defensively I think he definitely is but he’s not what this rebuilding franchise needs. However at this stage I think tort’s loves Laughton so much and there’s so much buzz about him getting traded season after season that I don’t believe anymore that he’ll ever be moved. But hey if he does get moved I’d prefer it over cates.But either poeling or cates has to go in my opinion and cates is the one on the expiring contract because I just don’t see coots as a top 2 center moving forward. He started off absolutely horrible but had that fantastic game where he had over half of his points this season and then has settled on being pretty decent since in the top 6 but he’s gonna be 33 next year with a horrible injury history and I don’t see him viable as a top 6 center for the remaining years on his contract. He needs to be transitioned to a 3rd line defensive role.Now I agree that frost is not currently good enough to be an actual top 6 center with his consistency problems. But I’m okay with still putting him there because I truly don’t care about wins and losses and if we happen to really suck again and get McKenna next year because Morgan frost happens to be the worst 1st line center in the league? I’ll be extremely happy with that.I don’t think we need to be looking to find an established center to replace frost with unless you would rather scrap the rebuild and just try and push for the playoffs
flyers,lxpko8l,2024-11-17 23:45:16,Lmaoooo how did I never hear that quote before
flyers,lxpgfjb,2024-11-17 23:14:43,This is now my new favorite flyers quote.
flyers,lxo2vrw,2024-11-17 18:08:53,>You can only put so many sharpies up your ass  \*slowly and carefully backs into the bushes\*
flyers,lxoookd,2024-11-17 20:16:51,And I thought my sous chef was stealing my sharpies…
flyers,lxnyoac,2024-11-17 17:44:44,Frost isn’t getting Rossi Minnesota may not even have him available anymore with the way he’s playing. Rossi would probably cost Forester and a 1st.
flyers,lxoolxw,2024-11-17 20:16:23,"I'm not against a trade if it makes the team better but I think that ""just get rid of Morgan Frost because I don't like him"" is counter-productive and irrational.  Like do you want the fucking team to have the best shot at winning or not?  Morgan Frost might or might not belong here but there's a absolutely a scenario in which he's the best option at a particular position."
flyers,lxrupkf,2024-11-18 11:07:18,Picks are lottery tickets with a calculable statistical value though and that value can absolutely be less than a player's predicted roster value.Morgan Frost is objectively worth about a 1st round pick (possibly a bit more) if you look at comparable trades made recently. Nick Foligno and Kyle Palmieri in 2021 for example were both 35-40 point guys with intermittent playdriving and xG success over their previous 3-year sample and both were older than Frost and clearly in decline when the trades happened.  Picks also come with a timeline.  The player picked is unlikely to be NHL-ready immediately and the lower the overall pick the longer it's likely to take before they are effective.  Michkov is here right now so you need to balance not only the player's overall peak value to the team but also the value contributed during our window of contention when Michkov is at his best.
flyers,lxny3n2,2024-11-17 17:41:27,"> I would trade him for pennies on the dollar just to never think about him any more.Referring to that part. Getting rid of one of your only NHL level centers so the fans ""don't have to think about him anymore"" isn't logical lol.It also doesn't solve our problems at center nor does it bring back any assets of any value back to the Flyers. So not a hurry in regards to Frosts' draft position but rather the Flyers future..."
flyers,lxo2hg2,2024-11-17 18:06:34,>What do you honestly think Frost is at this point?It literally doesn't matter what you think he is.  Throwing away roster value when your team is rebuilding is just objectively dumb full stop.
flyers,lxop4yb,2024-11-17 20:19:37,He certainly seems to be Danny Briere's preferred 2/3/4/whatever C at the moment so...
flyers,lxo7ebe,2024-11-17 18:35:32,So is Frost. Maybe our junk is better on their team and vice versa.
flyers,lxo7hlv,2024-11-17 18:36:04,Insert Frost in the same post and it’s no different.
flyers,lxo0j0v,2024-11-17 17:55:21,Take a 2nd rd pick in this years draft tho
flyers,lxo3eak,2024-11-17 18:11:55,No shit dude. I just said my take is irrational. Did you read the rest of my response or are you here to pick a fight?
flyers,lxoqaph,2024-11-17 20:26:44,I don't understand the argument. He's been absolute dogwater.
flyers,lxo7sw9,2024-11-17 18:37:54,Meh. I'd rather trade for a guy I think COULD be better. Just don't see it with Krebs at all.
flyers,lxo8for,2024-11-17 18:41:34,There’s a chasm the size of the Grand Canyon between Frost and Krebs when it comes to their track records. Frost may frustrate us with his inconsistency but he’s a tried-and-true NHL player. Krebs may be an NHL-AHL tweener at this point.
flyers,lxoob66,2024-11-17 20:14:33,Not trying to pick a fight... I'm just being honest.  I'm sure you're a nice person and all... irrational takes are just my least favorite thing about sports fans and I can't respect them.
flyers,lxovc97,2024-11-17 20:57:41,"I'm saying that contrary to your claim he apparently IS someone's preferred C because Briere has been supportive of his development since he took the reins.    I'm just guessing here since I can't read the GM's mind but the argument is probably that they think he can be better and more consistent in the future than he has been so far.And quite a few other players have also been as you put it ""dogwater"" so far this season. Should we trade the entire forward corps?  Or are Tippett Foerster Cates Farabee Poehling and Brink somehow immune to all of the criticisms you think Frost is guilty of?"

flyers,lxnvrkg,2024-11-17 17:28:13,Which contract is worse???Couts having 5 more years at just under 8 mil while already looking like a washed up depth guy is easily one of top 5 worst contracts in league and no other Flyers contract comes close unless I am somehow forgetting someone big.

No disrespect to Cates he is playing well and I like his game but c'mon Torts can we get Mich back on the first line again soon? You made your point.
flyers,lxlxjx4,2024-11-17 11:08:18,Arya is going to steal his Stanley Cup winning goal confirmed.

flyers,lxmtdl5,2024-11-17 14:01:12,Ppl scoff at this idea now - but there’s a very real possibility that Michkov ends up the better player between he and Bedard.They were neck and neck as prospects in the years leading up to their draft year. It was harder to scout Michkov in Russia / there was the risk of him not coming…the convo between the two separated as the draft got closer. But I still wonder if we actually won the Bedard draft
flyers,lxm0cb9,2024-11-17 11:23:46,-8 for bedard and -3 michkov if anyone was wondering. Also bedard is -52 for his career already. +/- may or may not be a good stat or watever but -52 is a lot
flyers,lxobpgh,2024-11-17 19:00:41,Here’s hoping since we finally have a GM who played alongside a franchise superstar and watched an organization squander his career he’ll be able to build a team to support him rather than rely on him

flyers,lxm7t8t,2024-11-17 12:04:48,Lets not get to crazy just yet. If the organization thinks we are content they may treat this kid like Giroux and make him play with a shit team the majority of his career.

For god sake can we please have nice things in Philly. I have been watching and waiting for 25 years. No Cup no game changers poor pick after poor pick. Don’t get me started on the Goalie nightmares we have been suffering through. Please don’t break this kids spirit.
flyers,lxmp4pw,2024-11-17 13:39:12,Not if Torts continues to bench him a few more times this year
flyers,lxn17tp,2024-11-17 14:42:45,Even if MM is a better player Bedard will end up with better career numbers because Chicago will get him a 1C to play with.
flyers,lxmozdm,2024-11-17 13:38:25,IMO …. If the Flyers are pushing to make playoffs this year (which is what it looks like) they should make a push to get Evgeny Malkin from Pittsburgh. Malkin is 38 and under contract for this year and next year at only 6mm per year. He’s also still a point per game player and he’s Russian too (which can only help)
flyers,lxm4noh,2024-11-17 11:47:23,He fucking SOLD that shit!
flyers,lxm7ug4,2024-11-17 12:05:00,I didn’t get a chance to watch the game but saw the highlight of that play. I know it’s a 2 on 0 but he absolutely pooped on the goalie with that fake shot. Absolute beaut of a goal and I love TK defending him after the hit instead of celebrating
flyers,lxm4szj,2024-11-17 11:48:12,He's just dangerous to both score and dish it for a scoring chance. That's what is so impressive about him. His awareness in the offensive zone is off the charts.
flyers,lxnyncf,2024-11-17 17:44:35,What’s more is he kept looking back at Travis as if to sell the pass then turned to sell the shot and then made the pass anyway. It was indeed a sight to behold.
flyers,lxm6e04,2024-11-17 11:56:55,That’s why I was very happy with keeping TKHonestly our winger depth is pretty solid. We just need damn centers so bad
flyers,lxmicih,2024-11-17 13:03:10,Can’t wait to be buyers at the deadline
flyers,lxo686o,2024-11-17 18:28:32,MM39 getting what the support he needs is paramount to this team's success. I'm just curious if we go big this draft (tank in the latter half?) or flop into the McKenna sweepstakes next year. In any case 3-5 years looks like the beginning/opening of the window assuming the track we're on doesn't change.
flyers,lxm4mj4,2024-11-17 11:47:13,I think the priority is to get Tippet going. Tippet hasn't done shit yet and playing with Cates ain't gonna help. Michkov is producing with 3rd liners and looks great on the PP. Maybe drop TK to the 2nd line and have MM play with Coots and Tippet? But how down you push TK down the line up when he is clearly your best player?
flyers,lxm8h5s,2024-11-17 12:08:29,Wanting to see MOAR MATVEI is totally understandable from a fan perspective and I'm right there with you but I can also kind of see the wisdom of Tort's decision.  Michkov simply cannot play 82 games at 20+ minutes/game in his rookie year and have the kind of production we want to see from him.  He's freaking awesome but the NHL is grueling and he's never had to play this much hockey over this period of time before in his life.  He should absolutely get time with the top players on the PP and at 5-on-5 but it would be unreasonable to just stick him with TK for the entire game every game and let him go to work.  He's already shown that he needs downtime to assimilate improvements and coaching for the parts of his game that aren't strong yet and there are *definitely* areas that he needs to improve so that he can spend more of his ice time doing the things he's amazing at instead of hemmed in the defensive zone.      There's just no need this season when we aren't close to contending to rush him or force him to carry the entire team on his back.  That will come and make no mistake- this kid is going to be a top-5 or maybe even top-3 player in the NHL. But it might be better in the long run if we don't try to force it to happen right this very moment even if we're fiending like crackheads for it.
flyers,lxm8bx4,2024-11-17 12:07:40,I'm ok with him not being on the top line he's still got a lot to learn about NHL level 5v5... just please not with Cates he doesn't have an offensive bone in his body.

flyers,lxmp2b4,2024-11-17 13:38:51,He knows that the goalie knows he can score so like that TK pass he sells the fucking shot and passes it to TK for an even easier goal. That’s a fucking winning mindset plus the next time he might not pass.
flyers,lxn35sm,2024-11-17 14:53:23,This and also his enthusiasm for the team.  He's 19 been here for not even half a season can barely speak English but every goal that the team scores he's gotta a smile on his face like a little kid at a candy shop

flyers,lxmryru,2024-11-17 13:53:56,I’ve seen some Hockey talking heads last night saying they think it might be better to move Bedard to Winger. He was 0-8 in face offs last night and is only winning face offs at 34% clip which means he’s playing a lot of defensive hockey once you lose face off.

flyers,lxmta6n,2024-11-17 14:00:42,I could not imagine the fit this fanbase would be throwing without TK playing with Mich we complain about not having the talent to pair with Mich but we do In TK and some others and going forward it'll help Mich understand playing at that level in the nhl. Putting an emphasis on Mich developing is much more important than worrying about guaranteeing picking 5th over 11th he'll probably win the calder and have that confidence and be a flyer at heart. Otherwise you're just Buffalo for a decade consistently underdeveloping their talent
flyers,lxmmq1z,2024-11-17 13:26:40,Edmonton's 1st back to them for McDavid or Draisaitl seems fair to me.

flyers,lxm7fnt,2024-11-17 12:02:45,Yeah those are good points and a very pragmatic suggestion but TK + MM = Magic.
flyers,lxmke5f,2024-11-17 13:14:15,I'd prefer to keep the 3rd line as is.  It seems to be working and has a pretty good amount of speed that can put a defense on its back foot.  Plus with it being the 3rd line it may take some pressure off of Mich and give him easier matchups to exploit.
flyers,lxm77ub,2024-11-17 12:01:32,Tippett has a single digit hockey IQ
flyers,lxttyo8,2024-11-18 17:07:39,The priority should have been to move Tippett. He is what he is and now that teams have seen enough of him they're game planning for him accordingly. Lots of speed physical hell of shot absolutely no brain. He's the Braydon Coburn of forwards.

flyers,lxpfjsu,2024-11-17 23:08:24,i was there. i legitimately thought he shot it didn’t look like it was TK from where i was (sec 103).
flyers,lxmyy17,2024-11-17 14:30:29,Perfectly written Another thing to note is that it takes some players longer to develop. As an ex Coyotes fan we waited a long time for Hayton (top 5 pick I believe) and Strome (picked 3rd in McDavid draft) to develop. Hayton still hasn’t hit his full potential (probably won’t) and Strome only now reached his potential long after he left Arizona. So I am perfectly fine if TK causes us to move up in the standings (even if we aren’t in playoffs) if that means he helps the development of our young guys It’s also important that the other guys on this team develop. What good is picking 3rd overall if Foerster Beez York Brink and the rest of that 22-26 core blow?
flyers,lxn34e0,2024-11-17 14:53:10,It’s not that black and white. Getting higher draft picks during a rebuild doesn’t mean you’re destined to turn into Buffalo. Likewise surrounding Michkov with talent in his early seasons doesn’t mean he’s magically going to hit a ceiling that he wouldn’t be able to hit without those other players. Each roster decision we make during this rebuild has advantages and disadvantages. We’ve just got to hope that Briere‘s choices eventually result in a team that has a strong extended championship window if and when that window does open.
flyers,lxoed3l,2024-11-17 19:16:03,Ya I was for trading TK but so far I'm very happy to be proven very wrong. It's good to have someone Mich can work with and succeed!Nice to see TK in beast mode also.
flyers,lxm8bx3,2024-11-17 12:07:40,Dude takes shots but has terrible aim. Hopefully the stiffer blade works for him (again)
flyers,lxmksxb,2024-11-17 13:16:27,"Yeah his athleticism and skill is *easily* elite but he's also one of the most tunnel-visioned players in the league. He just doesn't adapt to plays. The anti-Michkov in that sense. He thinks ""I'm gonna rush in and score"" and tries exactly that regardless if a much more deadly pass opens up a second later."
flyers,lxpjyfb,2024-11-17 23:40:01,204 same. Haha
flyers,lxn2zmb,2024-11-17 14:52:28,If Foerster Beez York Brink and the rest of that 22-26 core blow then picking 3rd overall should allow you to replace or demote at least one of them.
flyers,lxmac1k,2024-11-17 12:18:52,Literally missed a goddamn open net.  Not even an “open net” where the goalie was badly positioned.  An open net where the goalie was on the bench.  Christ almighty Owen.

flyers,lxllugu,2024-11-17 10:00:02,I've been to the Holiday Spectacular before usually it is an extended pregame ice show with Gritty dressed as Santa and (I assume) the ice girls dancing to Christmas music. I want to say it's only like 5-10 minutes I believe.
flyers,lxo5khp,2024-11-17 18:24:42,I don’t think the tickets are pricier because it’s a holiday spectacular. It’s a Saturday 7 o’clock game and there’s hardly any home games next month. It’s nothing overly spectacular though. It’s just more fun shit more family friendly.

flyers,lxlcxbv,2024-11-17 09:00:58,"Can you imagine watching your favorite team and being mad every time we score make great defensive plays or make saves?  Just yelling at the screen like ""F you TK!  How dare you have 19 points in the last 12 games you're ruining everything!"" That must be a horrible way to live."
flyers,lxleasb,2024-11-17 09:10:37,Loser ass energy.You have to start kicking it into gear sometime. We have Michkov as our centerpiece. We have 3 first and 3 second rounders this year to fill that out. A losing culture is not the way to go
flyers,lxlc5gq,2024-11-17 08:55:28,They brought it up last night but Buffalo is a great case of tanking not always working out. Not only did their first rebuild fail to launch (and the cornerstones of that rebuild immediately have success other places) but this second phase of the rebuild is also struggling. They had a top 10 pick each year for a decade from 2013-2022 and only have 4 of those guys on their team. They had an additional 8 guys taken 11th-16th over the last 13 years. They just had to trade a 2022 top 10 pick who was averaging over 2 points per game in the WHL for a depth forward cause they had too many high skilled young players and prospects. Their highest scoring forwards the last two seasons were former first round picks they traded for when they were 21 and 25 respectively and they both out performed expectations. They currently have the first defenseman taken from the 2018 2019 and 2021 drafts. They have a top 3 goalie prospect in the league who the Flyers just lit for 4 goals.You couldn't ask for a better collection of picks and prospects and the Sabres are still not looking like a playoff team this year. Buffalo is an extreme case but a lot of teams have put together a bunch of high end prospects and are still struggling to be competitive. Ottawa probably won't make the playoffs Utah has had eleven top 12 picks over the last 12 years the Ducks are loaded with young talent the Canadiens have had top five picks in each of the last three years and they seem like they won't be competitive before the end of the decade.Building a winning hockey team is hard. Young players need time to develop but they develop better in winning environments. Right now they have some very good high end pieces both older and younger with guys like Konecny and Michkov up front and Sanheim and York on the back end. They also have strong depth pieces with some of them under team control like Cates and Poehling or older guys like Seeler and Ristolainen who have time on their contracts to pass the baton to prospects like Bonk and McDonald. Right now they could use another high end piece and stronger middle six. That could come from within the team if guys continue to develop or it can come from the draft. Just cause they can't make a deep run this year doesn't mean they aren't building towards a team that makes a deep run.
flyers,lxlyl3y,2024-11-17 11:14:00,Upcans alt?
flyers,lxlfw7l,2024-11-17 09:21:35,Teams go through 5+ year long rebuilds and do not end up with a player as talented as Michkov. Do we need more pieces? Yes. Would I prefer more high picks? Of course. But nothing is guaranteed. We ended up with JvR and Nolan Patrick drafting 2nd overall. Red Wings and Sabres went through hell and back and now that they are ready to compete they can’t get over the hump. The star-studded Leafs is yet to make it past the second round and Auston Matthews is 27 years old. The Flyers are choosing to be in control of certain things: culture player development and installing a competetiveness throughout the squad. Time will tell if management were right with this direction.
flyers,lxmv72u,2024-11-17 14:10:37,Im a little embarrassed for you. The team being good with michkov and TK being good to elite believe it or not is GOOD. Losing for a high pick is good too Im not against tanking  but michkov is a clear elite player. Him getting 80 pts would mean so much more than a guy like porter martone or misa.
flyers,lxl99ue,2024-11-17 08:34:31,Maybe send the team some mail asking the boys to stop trying to win. OR you can kick back and enjoy good hockey when they play well and critique the moves Briere makes because only a GM can make a rebuild happen.
flyers,lxl90r6,2024-11-17 08:32:32,If you want the Flyers to lose there are 31 other teams in the NHL that you can choose to root for. Penguins fans want us to lose the most. Go be a Pens fan. See ya 
flyers,lxl83hl,2024-11-17 08:25:57,Good players don’t want to stay on teams that lose. See buffalo’s turnover for example. We just need to be trading for assets when we can and not for rental/aged players until we really do want to make that push.
flyers,lxlcpcm,2024-11-17 08:59:24,Flyers don't need to be the bottom team every season. They need to let young goalie talent develop move pieces of value for picks and not sign bad veteran contracts when the rebuild is over.
flyers,lxlb61d,2024-11-17 08:48:25,The problem with the 2010s was we always started buying too early. And we had idiot GMs who would get rid of future hof goaltenders for pretty much pennies. Tanking will only hurt the progress of our young players. They need to play meaningful games and play hard in order to develop. We have so many picks and assets in the cupboards to make serious moves and the 2010s gms wouldve already spent them for like panarin who is still good but like will only be so for 2 more years. Instead we arent making moves and allowing the kids to develop. Which is the correct decision. We would have to sell off players we need to build with to tank and if we did that add like 6 more years to the rebuild.
flyers,lxn12ko,2024-11-17 14:41:58,Maybe I’m getting old but it used to be cheer for the pens to lose and cheer for the flyers to win. Now it seems like it’s the other way around and it confuses me
flyers,lxlf0e4,2024-11-17 09:15:33,Tbh I would be in the same boat of MM wasn't a big part of the success. Chances are they will mess this up. Not tanking because of Buffalo is as dumb as viewing the Blues as a team to replicate. Both are exceptions in the cap era.Right now they are playing 3 4Cs and still scratching out wins to hockey .500. 1C and 1D are still major issues (although Sanheim is playing like a 1D right now). Frost's has been terribly developed and is worth nothing trade wise now. Tippett Foerster and Farabee are trending the wrong way but it is early. Brink gets the Frost treatment of hyper focus on marginal issues when his sole focus should be offense.Shaw is doing a great job with the D though. Hopefully Drysdale doesn't have the hockey sense of Phil Myers and can reach his potential 
flyers,lxob00w,2024-11-17 18:56:34,Many teams that have rebuilds never end up winning a cup. The Flyers might be on the road to being one of those teams. Even if they are it’s still possible to enjoy the ride.
flyers,lxp3zq4,2024-11-17 21:51:17,You can't tank forever. At some point you gotta go go from bad to mediocre/average. Right now the Flyers are average.
flyers,lxmkma9,2024-11-17 13:15:27,It's so funny seeing people say if we want to watch a losing team go watch one of the other 31 teams . Do these people fail to realize the flyers have been a losing team since 1975? The last time we made a run was 2010 lmao. Looks like all those retools we have done have paid off with cups... Oh wait... This team wasted giroux. This team never committed to a tear it down rebuild and yet people are still convinced we don't need to do that. I guess people are completely fine with winning some games and finishing in the middle of the league every year. Some of the fans are so short sighted. And to the people who argue tanking doesn't mean cups.. I would say it works more so than not. 
flyers,lxm2c5r,2024-11-17 11:34:40,Upcan pops off a fingernail everytime Sanheim takes it end to end
flyers,lxlj39a,2024-11-17 09:42:42,never have done that.Your imagination is quite wild and far fetched.I watch every game. I am happy when they play well and you see young players stepping up and growing. I am not upset at winning at all. However I see the bigger picture and a push for the playoffs should not be the priority at all. Playing Johnson and ND over Andrea or Michkov is something that would never happen on a team like the Avs.The team has everything they need to be a true contender for 10 years if they get the picks they need. Having three first and the best pick being in the mid teens is not going to push the needle much. Getting a top 10 pick plus the 2 other first and high seconds could give the Flyers everything they need to be a powerhouse. That is what I want to see. The Flyers as a powerhouse....the next Colorado or Florida.....not the next Minnesota.But saying I actively root for the team to lose is a big crock of shit.
flyers,lxpy3ek,2024-11-18 01:41:31,I see your culture point here. However evidence would suggest that the posters accurate in his assessment that losing is the best way to address the flyers number 1 problem which is no number one center. Of the last 10 Stanley cup champions 9 of them had their top line center drafted in the top 4 picks (you can argue about Point being top line center for the lightning at the time). The only one not aquired by the draft was Eichel by Vegas.  Drafting your number 1 center in the top 4 is a predictor of Stanley cup success. That being said I really like the way this team has been drafting and developing in the last 2-3 years. And Anze Kopitar was drafted at 11 for Los Angeles. This strategy could work and maybe we will see that the Stars/Flyers strategy will produce Stanley cups based on strength of depth. Although teams like this are very hard to keep together over the long term in salary cap league.It's a struggle to juggle the thought of what the flyers need with the really fun hockey we are seeing right now  so I personally relate the posters view point. 
flyers,lxlol8y,2024-11-17 10:16:34,Yep you make a lot of great points.One other point you missed is that we will get better assets when trading away guys like Risto Laughton Farabee or one of our goalies if they *and* the team are playing well.Take Sean Walker for example. We took a guy that no one wanted and turned him into a first round pick *because* he and the team were playing well.It is possible to collect picks and assets while not being a bottom 5 team. Personally I'd rather have Michkov and York succeed and develop than not. Even if we got a 5th overall pick. We still have Zavragin Jett Bonk Barkey Berglund Ruohonen Gill and Tuomala to be excited about. Even if they don't turn out to be McDavids and Makars they're not dog shit.
flyers,lxobn6q,2024-11-17 19:00:19,Rebuilds sometimes don’t work.Sometimes they do though.Most cup winners in the salary cap era have rebuilt. That’s the argument. No one is saying it’s fool proof.
flyers,lxmvqrf,2024-11-17 14:13:27,the sabres have tanked got multiple 1oas and as a result drove guys like ror to hate the game and all around hurt that organization for a decade. im good on that man.

flyers,lxlh80y,2024-11-17 09:30:29,"No real fan wants them to lose. But getting points in the standings and costing themselves top elite talent for the pipedream of making the playoffs  seems like a pretty dumb idea for a team trying to do a ""rebuild"""
flyers,lxlgsj2,2024-11-17 09:27:34,***we always started buying too early***You mean like with TK Seeler Tippett and more?The Flyers need 4 major pieces before they are ready to be a true contender. They need a #1C #2C #1D #2D. Drysdale is a 3rd pairing at best and no I don't think Sanhiem or York are true top pairing dmen. They have made poor decisions on resigning certain players. 4x8 year contracts..it is too much for a team that is not even good enough to be a wild card team. I am not hoping they lose. That is just a line thrown out there by the brainwashed. I want the team to build properly..draft players that fit proper NHL roles not just playing a 200' game as the priority. I want them to drop the older guys and get a coach that actually works with his talent instead of benching them because he doesn't have a clue how to coach in todays NHL. The catch phrase of tanking didn't work for Buffalo and Edmonton. Not yet. Buffalo issues hasn't been the players but the total incompetance of the management team to be able to give the team a good coach and a proper direction. Edmonton just made the Finals last year and is the Cup favorite this year. Tanking did work for Tampa Florida LA Pitts and many others. I am not wanting a tank at all. But building a team properly and not rushing the project as they always do is the issue. Signing TK was dumb. Michkov plays the same position and is projected to be a superstar. So the Flyers sign their #1 winger to an untradeable 8 year extension taking them until he is 38 years old. Blocking the future superstar from playing his true position. I like TK but he is not worth that kind of committment for where the team is right now. The assetts he could have brought back should have addressed 1 of the 4 glaring needs on the team.They are in a lottery position right now and not due to it being the direction the team was trying to go. They legit think this is a playoff team and it is not. Face reality and build the team to be a true contender and not a wannabe.
flyers,lxlho2c,2024-11-17 09:33:24,Also they have been spinning their wheels building the team this way since the mid 1990's at least. What do they have to show for it?  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!!If they built the team properly we would have already had another trip as a contender and would be where we are now in a rebuilding stage instead it's been almost 30 years of complete incompetence which no change of thinking for the future.
flyers,lxp3kff,2024-11-17 21:48:40,I swear that wants to jump off the Ben Franklin anytime the Flyers score.
flyers,lxo99f0,2024-11-17 18:46:21,>Personally I’d rather have Michkov and York succeed and develop than not.Did Crosby not succeed because the Pens missed the first playoffs his 1st season and picked 2nd?Did Ovechkin not succeed because the Caps missed the first playoffs his 1st season and picked 5th?Did Stamkos not succeed because the Bolts missed the first playoffs his 1st season and picked 2nd?
flyers,lxlb1f4,2024-11-17 08:47:29,Agree with both. Anytime I hear someone want their team to lose it makes me wish we had the relegation system instead of the draft lottery. Rebuilding can mean playing young guys like we are it doesn’t have to mean intentionally losing
flyers,lxlebzn,2024-11-17 09:10:51,I always felt Sanheim’s development was hurt by the Flyers prioritizing Provorov and all but anointing him as a franchise 1D right after drafting him. Sanheim turned out to be the much better player.
flyers,lxlf2a4,2024-11-17 09:15:54,Ive said it a few times I will say it again the ducks cant develop shit. Drysdale being where he is at I dont think is his fault and now he is in the hands of torts and if torts knows one thing... its defenseman. Torts has said Jamie doesnt know how to play but he still puts him in a ton because he clearly sees drysdale has something there and is trying to build him.
flyers,lxm8mz2,2024-11-17 12:09:24,This is what we need to keep in mind with York Drysdale and Andrae. 3 legit and young defensemen that could very easily put us in future conversations with best defense in front of goalie. (Zavagrin/Ersson). We’re on a good track currently and hopefully everything keeps going right.
flyers,lxmiv2a,2024-11-17 13:05:58,JD is only 22 y/o man. Think about where you were at 22. Even Seeler now is 31 and it took him coming here ~4 years ago to really solidify his game. If we let Shaw keep cooking he's gonna come up with magic no doubt in my mind
flyers,lxlj0z0,2024-11-17 09:42:18,Power forwards and D Men take longer to develop and peak generally. It’s why LeClair was a throw in in the Desjardins trade. You see it all the time. Hell PLAYERS sometimes take time to develop. If fans had their way Brandon Graham would have been traded for a bag of chips after his rookie year. You’re seeing it now with Nakobe Dean and (to a lesser extent so far) Nolan Smith. Philly sports culture has NO patience or chill. You’re a bust/stud on a game by game basis sometimes.
flyers,lxn53da,2024-11-17 15:04:02,I think Sanheim has always been criminally underrated by our fanbase and his recent surge in play has largely been due to the simple fact of Provorov being gone and taking some of his responsibilities and proving that he was better all along.
flyers,lxlqkyn,2024-11-17 10:28:20,I've always seen it in him. He is the perfect example of a guy that just needed to believe he was great. He has every single tool. His skating has always been great. He's got the stick handling. He's got the shot. He's a big guy and is just starting to use his body more. He's got a great defensive stick and he's just got this determination on top of it all now.Reminds me of myself in chel. Pure dominance.
flyers,lxmgsra,2024-11-17 12:54:42,Sanheim’s biggest crime was always being tall in a post passing on Caufield world.Forreal though he always had 1d upside.  He was doing things in the AHL that would’ve made Quinn Hughes fans blush.  Plus he’s big has the reach the skating the skill the shot and an ability to drive the net through traffic.  Seems like he finally has the muscle mass to put together a full season but we’ll see.  Here’s hoping he’s just reaching his prime now and can put it together for 82+ for the duration of his contract.Flyers should probably throw the bag at Shaw like the Eagles do Stoutland and I’ll have faith they’ll be able to fix any dman with a higher hockey iq than Phil Myers.
flyers,lxl1xq4,2024-11-17 07:36:30,Can we slow the roll a little bit.  I'm very happy he's playing well right now. He but he's had flashes of brilliance before.  Before we call him a stud like let's just wait a little longer to see if he keeps it up.
flyers,lxmspg1,2024-11-17 13:57:43,"""PATIENCE??  How long with THAT take??"""
flyers,lxmnaoj,2024-11-17 13:29:42,Im all for patience. Only thing I’ll say and it’s similar with Couturier’s progression and early hatred from fans until it paid off Sanheim had pretty encouraging underlying numbers. Couturier consistent had fantastic underlying numbers. Sanheim was a bit more inconsistent and kinda went every other year but they showed some very promising signs. So far Drysdale doesn’t have that. His numbers have been truly bad bad. But he’s much younger still and has more development ahead. Im by no means giving up hope just think it’s something that should be noted.
flyers,lxn1qyj,2024-11-17 14:45:41,It's not just Drysdale. I've seen many Flyers fans saying Farabee is a bust too. He's only 24 and has shown a lot of promise and had neck surgery two years ago. I still have very high hopes for him. Frost is another story. Most points on the team last year from January to April then back into the doldrums this season. He's also shown a lot of promise but has been inconsistent and so far has not shown that compete level he needs. But Sanheim didn't either until age 27 so it's still possible. Not sure I'd bet money on Frost becoming a consistently good to great NHL player but I wouldn't call him a bust yet and I wouldn't trade him for peanuts.
flyers,lxr1m2q,2024-11-18 08:13:41,I feels like sanheim's game can be described by what his face looks like. The guy had serious baby face up until last season and his game was soft to match.  Now this season he's beginning to look like a viking warrior and his game aligns. Torts must love watching the way this kid battles compared to just 2 seasons ago.  He's a confident player these days far more willing to get his nose dirty.
flyers,lxlmqz1,2024-11-17 10:05:29,There are a few key differences; Durability size and the biggest one is probably that Sanheim was a good NHL player posting very good results by his *2nd* NHL season while Drysdale is still playing terrible in his *5th*Sanheim wasnt a bad player the previous 6 seasons.  He got a 8 year 50 mil contract for a reason.  He had multiple 2/3D level seasons already w/ great play driving and 5v5 scoring.Hes just been inconsistent and seems to have taken it up a notch.
flyers,lxlufu4,2024-11-17 10:50:37,That’s a really good point— definitely calms my nerves with Jamie. I really *really* want him to figure it out (partially because I want to win the Cutter trade lol)
flyers,lxmrff9,2024-11-17 13:51:04,drysdale is 100% a victim of the ducks
flyers,lxmomy9,2024-11-17 13:36:37,Hey uh... The Ducks might be ass right now and for the past handful of seasons but drafting and developing defense has never been a problem for the organization. Even though I think you're technically right with Drysdale specifically because he came up under Eakins staff which was disastrous (and something they're still paying for with Cronin trying to turn guys into hockey players) that was just a weird statement to read lol.
flyers,lxngb0d,2024-11-17 16:03:30,>if torts knows one thing...it's defensemen I'm not disagreeing but what examples are there of this?
flyers,lxt550h,2024-11-18 15:01:44,This is exactly why I've got no concern over Drysdale right now. I don't think highly of the Ducks and Torts/Shaw CLEARLY knows how to develop defenseman that everybody has written off. It might take some time but I'm sure Drysdale will be *something* it's just a question of how good that something is.
flyers,lxseptz,2024-11-18 12:49:04,JD has so much raw talent. He’s such an elite skater… I really think JDs gonna develop into a 1D or at worst an amazing top 4 guy. Just needs patience and for the fanbase to give a lil bit more support instead of just ripping on our young guys on a rebuilding team
flyers,lxoghhx,2024-11-17 19:27:52,It's not just Philly it's just modern day sports culture
flyers,lxt8ncm,2024-11-18 15:19:51,I'm going to have to disagree with you. His play lately is in fact better than it was last year IMO. A lot of his success last year came off the fact that Sanheim was allowed to ALWAYS activate because York had to cover for him basically full time (Which I'm convinced is also why York's offense doesn't look as good by the points he produced despite always looking good when he did so by my eye). This season I think Sanheim is doing a noticeably better job of choosing when he'll activate and it means that he isn't forcing his partner to cover him.
flyers,lxl3avj,2024-11-17 07:48:15,Nah he's a stud.  It's not a fluke when guys play 27 minutes a night in the NHL.
flyers,lxl5qk0,2024-11-17 08:07:47,He’s been good for us from the start. All the haters had no idea what they were looking at.
flyers,lxn4ez3,2024-11-17 15:00:20,"Fowler Manson Montour Lindholm Theodore (to some extent) Mintyukov Zellweger...I agree with the general statement that they did a poor job with Drysdale and his specific development in some aspects but you're 100% correct that the general claim that ""they can't develop defensemen"" just couldn't be any further from the truth"
flyers,lxl4jjg,2024-11-17 07:58:32,100%. i think he got overplayed last year leading to a decline. if the D keeps it up doesn’t seem like torts will have to resort to that this year.
flyers,lxlme3w,2024-11-17 10:03:22,Playing a lot doesnt mean you are a stud.  Risto used to play huge minutes in Buffalo ...Sanheim did the same exact thing last year before being bad in 2nd halfHes had stretches hes looked incredible in many seasons but has never been able to sustain itHe needs to show he can sustain it for a full season 1st

flyers,lxl8lwk,2024-11-17 08:29:50,Seems like injuries derailed his game last season moreso than just falling off a cliff for no reason.  He does need to keep it up tho.
flyers,lxjgwv8,2024-11-16 22:34:33,I agree wholeheartedly I just can't talk about great D without saying my boy Travis Sanheim continues to develop and is playing at the highest level I've ever seen him play

flyers,lxjmn43,2024-11-16 23:14:53,Let's home Emil isn't too banged up... He steadied this D core massively. York comes in for Zamula for sure. Then when Drysdale gets back Johnson imo.

flyers,lxjhl16,2024-11-16 22:39:12,If I’m in charge of the roster im waiving Zamula sending Kolosov down and having Richard challenge Cates in Mortal Kombat for playing time
flyers,lxk9gek,2024-11-17 02:31:37,Richard has been amazing! I can’t say it enough - Briere and the coaching staff have done a great job finding undervalued gems through trades and free agency. Maybe they have just gotten lucky? Maybe not? Either way if they can actually identify talent this way consistently it’s going to pay dividends when we start competing in the future.

flyers,lxpv5yh,2024-11-18 01:13:29,We’re two games under 500. Don’t buy the NHL lie that an OT loss is somehow a tie or something. It’s a loss. We certainly count the OT wins as wins.
flyers,lxrjqgl,2024-11-18 10:07:40,How is it that so many people in this sub can't comprehend the concept of Hockey .500?
flyers,lxjh9ea,2024-11-16 22:36:56,They aren't 500.  8-8-2 is under 500.  They have won 8 out of 18 games.  That's .444.
flyers,lxjsr59,2024-11-17 00:01:48,Yup just as predicted: This team is too decent to be bad and Tortorella has a knack for getting the absolute most out of his teams.None of this is a surprise. And when we get to lose in the first round/barely miss the playoffs we get to come up emptyhanded again without an elite draft pick. Just like 2013. And 2014. And 2015. And 2016. And almost 2017 if we hadn't lucked out in the lottery. And 2018. And 2019. And 2020. And 2021. And arguably 2022. And 2023 if Michkov didn't grace us. And 2024.
flyers,lxjtulp,2024-11-17 00:10:44,We are two games under .500 overtime losses are losses.
flyers,lxjhmtc,2024-11-16 22:39:32,Boosh is making it a personal mission to get Sanman on team Canada for the 4 Nations.That would be fun.If Russia was allowed to be there (I understand why they're not due to geopolitics) would Michkov be on their team? Russia is loaded with wingers but he currently has better stats than Buchnevich Tarasenko Kuzmenko and Voronkov.
flyers,lxjit2w,2024-11-16 22:47:22,Sanny is locked in lately and playing like the 1A nobody believes he can be making it look easy.
flyers,lxjnn2m,2024-11-16 23:22:20,They likely have a couple more weeks before they would have to send anybody down. Basically until all of York Drysdale and Ersson are healthy. If Andrae and Richard are still performing at a high level at that point I don’t think there is a way you send them down. I do wonder if they try to shop somebody particularly Frost to open up roster space instead of waiving somebody. They could run 13F/8D/2G now that Fedotov has solidified a spot.
flyers,lxjwc8v,2024-11-17 00:31:31,Our deadline trade piece is playing amazing 
flyers,lxjlyxo,2024-11-16 23:09:55,I wouldn’t mind mind keeping him on a cheap short term deal to play in our bottom 6 if we end up trading a winger for help at C.
flyers,lxjwbkc,2024-11-17 00:31:22,And that’s why you’re not in charge of the roster.
flyers,lxjltvf,2024-11-16 23:08:50,Zamula's value is not in his play. He is a guy in the locker room for Michkov and Fedotov to relate to.
flyers,lxjimfa,2024-11-16 22:46:08,Keeping Richard on the team is not worth risking losing Zamula.

flyers,lxtyl5y,2024-11-18 17:32:23,It's not like this is a bad draft. This is a deep draft and having a top 10 pick (I think the Flyers will end up with pick 10) is going to mean they're going to get a really good player. People forget that players climb and fall all the time. I'm not worried that someone in the top 7 will drop. It happens all the time.
flyers,lxktej2,2024-11-17 06:11:33,OTLs give you 1 point.  So they actually count as 1/2 of a win.  Or .5 of a win.  Or .500 of a win.
flyers,lxjj16e,2024-11-16 22:48:53,Personally after watching Michkov with my own eyes I think you'd be silly not to bring him to world tournaments based on upside alone (especially Olympics he could singlehandedly win shootouts like Oshie did) but who knows for sure honestly. National team rosters don't always make a ton of sense...like Giroux getting repeatedly snubbed for Team Canada 
flyers,lxjw7zr,2024-11-17 00:30:32,I mean Torts said the same thing post game. But I fear it’s not so much about how good Sanny is and more about the fact that there’s just so many good defensemen ahead of him. Who would he realistically beat out? Some good players are going to be left off the 4 nations teams.
flyers,lxk0ede,2024-11-17 01:05:02,Kaprizov Panarin and Ovechkin are all LWs. 1st RW is obviously Kuch. Buchnevich is great for not just his scoring he's good defensively and can score points. Then there are some unexpected dudes like Barbashev and Dorofeyev. And given Rotenberg would have been the head coach for sure I doubt Michkov had a lot of chances to make the team.
flyers,lxjo7er,2024-11-16 23:26:41,He looks 100% like that guy to me so far and with his development history I'm not even surprised. Hitting your prime at 28 is pretty accurate for dmen. He's my 1D till proven otherwise

flyers,lxlrrl9,2024-11-17 10:35:17,How many Canadian defensemen (outside of Makar) are ahead of him?He's a big strong smooth skating 1D who is currently 2nd in goals 5th in ice time and 20th in points out all the D in the league.I mean it's within the realm of possibilities.
flyers,lxll0f9,2024-11-17 09:54:53,Lol guess we missed our timing to trade him.
flyers,lxjktyz,2024-11-16 23:01:32,The issue is you are doing that in order to keep a 27 year old forward who only have 28 NHL games in 5 seasons and isn't going to be part of the rebuild. You shouldn't be risking losing a 24 year old defensemen for free to keep someone like Richard on the team.
flyers,lxjkbwc,2024-11-16 22:57:57,Poor asset management

flyers,lxlodw8,2024-11-17 10:15:21,This isn't a discussion.  The term of art is 'hockey 500' and it has a definition.
flyers,lxjsvfe,2024-11-17 00:02:45,While Richard isnt a part of future you cant send him down if he continues to play like this.  Zamula doesnt look to be a part of the future either b/c hes not good at all.Its not easy you gotta keep Richard in if he keeps scoring even if it means sending down a struggling younger player.
flyers,lxlvx89,2024-11-17 10:59:08,Would be great if he was playing like that this year and then he would make it moot but he's not.  He's in that group of Farabee Brink Frost Zamula and Tippet who have been largely invisible or have had very long stretches of invisible play.  Unfortunately for him he's the only one waiver exempt. The only other option I could see is to try and start a rotation of conditioning loans to the AHL for some of these players (maybe start with Drysdale since he's on IR).  Problem with that is players have to agree to it.
flyers,lxjwdui,2024-11-17 00:31:53,You can trade him tho…

habs,lxu08gi,2024-11-18 17:41:13,My guess is Pittsburgh wants to gain some assets but also be looking at NhL caliber players.With Sidney still playing at the level he’s at they aren’t going to go full on firesale.But a guy like Evans if on the block likely nets a decent return for the Habs. More so I’m thinking they’re looking at NHL guys on expiring deals they could get for a song.
habs,lxu8e1h,2024-11-18 18:27:16,I don't think you can ever fully count out a guy who made it to the SCF last season and game 7 at that.Even if he's no longer topping your list he should be somewhere on it. Even if he's not in your top three he should be penciled in the options if one of them gets injured
habs,lxu6p5l,2024-11-18 18:17:28,Wow I do not remember that at all. I even googled him before I commented in case I was misremembering and Google just said he was a player (I should have read the wiki instead of just the headlines). My bad.
habs,lxu31s6,2024-11-18 17:56:38,Evans is on an expiring deal and is expected to be moved at the trade deadline. He will definitely bring at least a 2nd round pick

habs,lxu45yf,2024-11-18 18:02:53,Yes and I am saying I don’t think that the Penguins are interested in that kind of a rental. More likely a guy like Dvorak for a conditional 5th or something.

habs,lxtg8it,2024-11-18 15:58:08,Monahan will be traded to us at the deadline and 2027 conditional 1st for Justin Barron.
habs,lxthbi2,2024-11-18 16:03:34,Depends on how much we're tanking this season. In all seriousness though I think they're going to try to make Dach work as the centre after easing him back into it but it's still too early to tell who might be on the trade block
habs,lxti006,2024-11-18 16:07:01,that is a good question. I doubt hage will be develop fast enough to take this role. Beck is more suited for a third line. Newhook and Dach might not have what it takes to fill the role. Evans is not good enough. Kapanen is not a top 6 player. There are three possibilities: 1- the 2025 draft: If we get lucky There are three centres who could possibly fill that role in mtl as soon as next season. (Frondell Hagens and Misa). I am personally more sceptical about Misa but a lot of people really like him. This being said the only sure player  in that list is Hagens and we would need to be  very lucky. 2- Trade or free agency. We might need the presence of a good veterans next year to help the team as we might lose Savard as well. We can't only have young guys. Getting a veteran centre for 1 or 2 years  could be a good idea if we want to win next season. 3- If we dont want to win at all cost I think Demidov could be a good centre and we could try him at this position as soon as next season. it might cost him the calder but in the long run it could be very good  for us.  It's my prefered option.
habs,lxthzgb,2024-11-18 16:06:57,Demidov is reportedly quite comfortable at centre. They might try him there if we can't find another solution.
habs,lxttcqb,2024-11-18 17:04:28,The 2025 UFA market for centers is horrible. No single one is interesting. Except maybe some hidden gem that I don’t know of but looks like our friend Kirby will have to put on his working boots and become a 2nd line centerman.
habs,lxtir9u,2024-11-18 16:10:50,If Rantanen makes it to FA we should throw the absolute bag at him. he plays wing and C but stick him between Laine and Demidov and look outSounds like the cap could be a high as $100 million
habs,lxtpdgq,2024-11-18 16:44:12,"This might be the ""home run"" trade we know will come at some point. Habs have so much draft capital and so much depth in the pipeline they can offer a very enticing package to another team for a true top 2C. I agree that nothing I've seen from Dach indicates he's the 2C same with Newhook but hopefully I'll be wrong about that. Free agency isn't what is was and I don't think it ever will be in the sense that a 27 year old superstar center walks to FA. Teams are locking them in at 21-22. Developing a center within the system is going to prolong the rebuild as nobody pops out yet. So that leaves a trade. Think of a team or teams that are in decline or on the edge of a cliff. Think 24-25 year old in exchange for prospects and picks and the list narrows."
habs,lxtlun9,2024-11-18 16:26:20,Depending on many things obviously but if all remains the same this season our next 2C (or 1C) will come from the draft.  That's what I'm hoping for anyway.
habs,lxtomci,2024-11-18 16:40:22,In the summer of 2025 management will have to make a decision based on three things:1) how has Dach’s return to play gone over the full season?2) who did we draft in 2025?3) do they think it’s essential the team make a big step in 2025-26?(2) really dictates everything else. If we draft James Hagens he will be playing 2C in 2025/26 and no further action is required. If we get Misa Frondell McQueen etc. they’re likely at least a year from the NHL (this also applies to Hage) so you have to assess whether they trust Dach to carry the load in the interim (or are willing to risk the coming season on him not continuing to improve) or if some stopgap is required.Based on what we’ve seen of management’s inclinations (such as the Laine trade trying to keep UFA offers short etc.) that might mean trading for the finals year or two of an experienced centreman’s contract.
habs,lxtvw4e,2024-11-18 17:17:55,All these UFA ideas are barf-inducing.Dach is the 2nd C in the long term. He wasn't moved to the wing he was moved to the 1st line. Major difference.He's going to go back to C once he has found his bearing. When he's at his peak he's everything one wants in a C. His defensive game is solid his transition game is solid his entry zones are solid his puck possession is solid.This is all more of the same typical shortsightedness on this sub thinking the last 2 weeks are deciding for the next 5 years.
habs,lxtw46t,2024-11-18 17:19:08,James Hagens
habs,lxtwdua,2024-11-18 17:20:34,I’ll be pretty disoppointed if we go into next season experimenting with Dach at center playing someone over there ability like evens or sticking a rookie like Demi or Hage in there. We need a proven Top 6 center.
habs,lxtwoys,2024-11-18 17:22:14,more than likely we run the same center group next yeareven if we draft Hagens or Misa they might not step into the NHL next year anyway and the FA class isn't great if they wanted to go that route
habs,lxtwuax,2024-11-18 17:23:02,Suzuki 1c and hard matchups. Demidov as an offensive 3c/pp player. Favorable offensive matchups. Sheltered.The 2 other centers share the workload with guys like Dach Roy and other winger that can play C.
habs,lxu0dav,2024-11-18 17:41:57,Phillip Danault? Seriously the Kings have a plethora of Center options and may need to free up some money to address their RHD situation not to mention they may need to add some draft capital. Surprisingly they are playing quite well and may not be as likely to make a move that veers towards a rebuild mindset. But their division is super tight. I don't see them holding off Vancouver and Edmonton and the Kraken and Flames seem plausible as a challenger for the 4th spot in the division.So maybe the Kings decide to move a player for picks/prospects. Why not look at Danault? I feel like he'd be at least willing to entertain a return especially since there's a new regime in Montreal.
habs,lxti249,2024-11-18 16:07:19,I wonder about a 1- 2 year deal on either duchene or Granlund. Or of course there zegras.. I dont think they go wth suzuki and dach though
habs,lxthu9u,2024-11-18 16:06:13,we're never trading with the bruins but charlie coyle would be nice
habs,lxtl6ya,2024-11-18 16:23:00,The goal is to draft Misa or Hagens and then with within 2 years put Suzuki in 2c Col - Misa/Hagens - Slaf Demidov - Suzuki - Dach
habs,lxth40w,2024-11-18 16:02:31,Whoever we draft in the top 5 this year.
habs,lxtgrgy,2024-11-18 16:00:46,Then we sell him back to Calgary for another 1st. Genius!
habs,lxtm9a8,2024-11-18 16:28:23,Can I ask what makes you sceptical about Michael Misa?  Thank you.
habs,lxtkbh0,2024-11-18 16:18:37,This is probably true if they decide Dach can’t cut it.However I’m not sure they break him into the NHL as a 2C. Hage is two years away Beck a year and probably starts lower in the lineup. The kid we draft this year likely won’t be ready for 2C either.If Dach doesn’t work out they need a 1-2 year bandaid.
habs,lxtkhiw,2024-11-18 16:19:28,I have no problem with 8x11.5-12.5M

habs,lxtyrhy,2024-11-18 17:33:20,> Dach is the 2nd C in the long term.let's hope not
habs,lxtyfu4,2024-11-18 17:31:36,Need to make a trade then. If we show up in 25-26 with the same centers it will be very disoppointing
habs,lxtk3fw,2024-11-18 16:17:29,Or Zacha always love him
habs,lxtlt0j,2024-11-18 16:26:06,Honestly I wouldn't rule out a trade with them. The Caps and Pens just made a trade and Gorton formerly worked for the Bruins
habs,lxtvk0r,2024-11-18 17:16:06,"He turns 33 before the end of the season. That would definitely be a short term band aid like Monahan. He's from Mass and has been a Bruin for 5-6 years. I highly doubt he'd want to come here. He's kind of a fringe 2C anyway. Like I still wouldn't say he have ""good"" center depth even with him. For me when I see teams in our position it always seems in the end that they'd have been better off biting the bullet and overpaying for a good long term solution rather than sinking more into patches and band aids over the course of a long time."
habs,lxtp4nm,2024-11-18 16:42:59,The old lion is always killed by the new lion?Some amorphous concept of Potential doesnt knock our 1c to 2.I am not sure kirby dach is long for the montreal canadiens world.
habs,lxu4yc6,2024-11-18 18:07:24,Posted the same thing and got downvoted so is anyone else saying the same thing yet jokes (I least I hope they're jokes) about recruiting monaghan or getting rantanen are voted to the top.

habs,lxts53y,2024-11-18 16:58:12,Gotta rub it in tho. Ask for their 2025 1st rounder.
habs,lxtp23m,2024-11-18 16:42:37,Here are my scouting notes so far. I hope it's just the sample I had and that I will change my mind on his potential during the season. Michael Misa 6'1 Centre 189 lbsStrenghts: Good skating protects the puck well is dynamic and goes to the dirty areas. Wants to make a difference. Calm under pressure from the opponent while in possession of the puck. Good backcheck often tries to steal the puck from the opponent subtly similar to Beck. Strong stick. Solid on his skates but not very physical.Weaknesses or things to work on: Quick decision-making.(too quick perhaps). He needs to create a little more space for himself and his teammates. He seems to lack the creativity of top line forward. . Relies on his speed for zone entries. Lacks physicial strenght for tough battles along the board. Likes to shoot a lot but oftentimes force the shot option when better options are available. Risk of being forced to the periphery with stronger defenders. Good passer but it's not a strenght.Projection:Ceiling: second line centre Floor: third line centre.most likely outcome is good second centre in a contending team
habs,lxu4ea4,2024-11-18 18:04:13,Thank Heavens fans' levels of whelmination is meaningless.

habs,lxtxivr,2024-11-18 17:26:41,Jeez dude this is like the third or fourth time I’ve seen you copy paste this about Misa why does everyone wanna know your thoughts? Uh anyways bit random but interested in what you think about Martone. I’ve heard him described as Matthew Tckahack puck skills combined with Brady’s body and physicality is that true? Cuz that sounds way too good to pass up.
habs,lxu4jg3,2024-11-18 18:05:02,Dach has been underwhelming GMs for 5 years now. Better?
habs,lxu16gv,2024-11-18 17:46:20,I mean the guy asked and its way esier than to type something different every time. Martone is very impressive. I haven't got the chance to watch a lot of hagens yet so I can't compare him to martone yet but let's say I really really enjoyed what I saw. I think this guy can play in the NHL next year. He is very cerebral which I was not expecting. And he has good hands a good vision and size. He is not scared of anything or anyone. Would not be surprised if he is picked 1st. So far and it's way early but I'd go with 1- Schaeffer  2- hagens 3- martone
habs,lxu4p8o,2024-11-18 18:05:57,Yes. Thank you GM-mind-reader.
habs,lxtb2oq,2024-11-18 15:32:12,20pts in 29 KHL games is really excellent for a D+1 player most good Russian prospects struggle to crack the lineup. He'll jump over here next year and be a good top 6 guy right off the bat.
habs,lxt8ot4,2024-11-18 15:20:03,20 pts in 29 games with 10 minutes of ice-time per game
habs,lxt6vyr,2024-11-18 15:10:43,"I think that we can stop with the """" at this point. While it was happening it was worth pointing out but he only has 4 games (on a total of 29) where he played under 6 minutes. We don't ""remove"" games when a guy get injured in the first period and barely play or when they get a game misconduct."
habs,lxtb4y8,2024-11-18 15:32:31,Didn't he score?
habs,lxtbw0j,2024-11-18 15:36:20,We should honestly just report his point totals not by games played but minutes played

habs,lxt8o9s,2024-11-18 15:19:58,It’s more to point out that it is really rough to play 5-10 minutes a game. Usually means every shift he has he goes in cold. Ultimately it’s very impressive to see him play smoothly after siting for the majority of the game.
habs,lxtgnjh,2024-11-18 16:00:13,Yea the situation is what it is and it’s not like we didn’t know how Russia operates before. We can move on
habs,lxu1h9h,2024-11-18 17:47:59,">We don't ""remove"" games when a guy get injured in the first period and barely play or when they get a game misconduct.Literally the entire point of /60 stats"
habs,lxu7jcp,2024-11-18 18:22:20,How about how many games under 12 minutes? That's on the low end of third line ice time. So far this season here are the forwards averaging less than 12 minutes: ABB Condotta Pezzetta Kapanen and Heineman.It isn't as if low ice time was driven by his play.We usually report point per game despite the ice time bias because ice time *is* correlated with quality of play (i.e. the best player get more ice time). That isn't happening with Demidov. It's the rare situation where p/60 is more appropriate when comparing him with other KHL prospects.
habs,lxtc1bg,2024-11-18 15:37:04,No his shot was deflected

habs,lxt0fjw,2024-11-18 14:37:57,Awesome choice dude. How’d you find Guhle for so cheap? I only see Suzuki for that price otherwise I have to customize a blank for a lot more.
habs,lxso1ys,2024-11-18 13:35:58,I'd really recommend the sewn nameplate personally
habs,lxtdd52,2024-11-18 15:43:46,From what I read in the description the stick is game used form 23/24 and the jersey should be blank. If you've never bought one they're an upgrade in material but designed to fit pads so it's a touch bigger in certain areas and tighter in others like the cuff on the sleeve is tapered.Last year they were 500 for for either a blank or used jersey signed item and a stick either new or used plus they threw in a gift at the end of it tooRegardless it's an insane deal you're paying 100 for a jersey and 100 for a stick. There's a couple places you can contact too if you want to get it stitched. You might also be able to sell the stick if you want
habs,lxt17vx,2024-11-18 14:41:57,I ordered two separate times and have not received confirmation for either yet. Payment went though though

It's currently listed as awaking shipment. I miss living in Canada as I can't get Hawkins Cheezies here and my health insurance is going up on Jan 1st but this was a good deal lolMy wife will be rolling her eyes at me as I've mentioned no more jerseys but hey what the hell lol  GHG !!

habs,lxt0tru,2024-11-18 14:39:57,Under the 70% off tab there were heat pressed Guhle jerseys. Looks like they’re gone now. I would’ve rather had a hand stitched but I couldn’t pass up the price. I also grabbed one of the mystery combos.

habs,lxsh67u,2024-11-18 13:01:19,Now he's gonna get bench because scoring too quickly on the faceoff prevent the deployment of the well executed plan by his coach.
habs,lxsfciy,2024-11-18 12:52:13,I know I'm educated in America but it really seems like you should be playing a guy like this higher up in the lineup

habs,lxt7aks,2024-11-18 15:12:49,Thank god he's not being under-utilized he might score more goals like these. It would be a big mistake.

habs,lxtahi2,2024-11-18 15:29:11,i think i remember him saying he prefers to play center but he at elast *can* play center im pretty sure
habs,lxsjj1j,2024-11-18 13:13:17,Thanks for doing this! I’ve been quite curious about the suite experience here’s a few of my questions:1. Was it worth it?2. Was it a better *watching* experience than a close to the glass seat?3. What do you get that a normal seat doesn’t have access to?4. Do you get distracted from the game too much?5. Is there anything special happening during intermissions or commercial breaks? 6. Are there any extra benefits that are not too obvious? Like do you get to meet the players for example
habs,lxsade0,2024-11-18 12:27:25,Can you tell me how much all in? And how many were in the suite?
habs,lxshs5f,2024-11-18 13:04:25,How much does it cost ? What did you get ? Was it worth it ?
habs,lxt403i,2024-11-18 14:56:00,Were you near the 405 section on Saturday? That group was having a blast at least from my angle.
habs,lxt6b9z,2024-11-18 15:07:47,I don't have a question I just wanted to say that when I was quite young I got to experience a suite at the Skydome. This was somewhere around 92/93 so prime WS winner Jay's team. I was a huge fan and very into the game which the Jays dominated but I was too young to really appreciate the suite experience. My dad and I were guests of the big wigs at his work so just kept my eyes on the game and minded my own business. All I really remember from the suite is that I was offered some pizza and declined saying I didn't like the toppings. 10 minutes later a fresh pizza without those toppings appeared on the table. For a kid like me that was absolute magic. Glad you enjoyed it and I'm glad the game was entertaining too!
habs,lxsa2aw,2024-11-18 12:25:52,If from out of province so forgive me if this is a dumb question is there like a hotel you can stay in like where the Blue Jays play or when you say rented a suite are we talking like a sky box where you gtfo when the game is done?
habs,lxsw6y3,2024-11-18 14:16:39,The best way I can sum this up- it feels like the Habs are playing in your at home living room. Surreal experience. Like I said - split the expenses up and it’s not cost prohibiting.
habs,lxt3jdk,2024-11-18 14:53:40,You had 17. What would the capacity be. Sounds like you were comfortable.  Could you have more and would it be too cramped if you had more?
habs,lxtw5mw,2024-11-18 17:19:21,How far in advance did you have to book this?
habs,lxsov2f,2024-11-18 13:40:02,1- Definitely worth it. But just a 1 time a year thing for me. My best experience at the Bell Center ever.2-watching experience was great. We had 2 rows of private seats that are out in front of the box.3- Open Bar Private washroom VIP entrance to avoid lines early access to the booth. Nothing else of really substance. But the comfort is off the charts.4-not at all. Some people were being more social than others but I was 100% attentive.5- not really. Except we didn’t have to deal with any crowds in the foyers. So time in between was strictly for socializing/ drinking/ having a good time.6- nothing more that what I’ve already said.
habs,lxsho9d,2024-11-18 13:03:52,About 10000. But we had 17 people. About 600$ each after you tip the bartender.
habs,lxsnckx,2024-11-18 13:32:25,About 10 grand. But we split it up 17 ways so approx 600$ each including gratuity for the bartender.
habs,lxsiynr,2024-11-18 13:10:25,Read
habs,lxt7i15,2024-11-18 15:13:54,No I was on the other end of the rink behind The CBJ Net.https://preview.redd.it/i5wk11yzwp1e1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a1461be5e11f4e28628c2fdb29095d7eeca0ccHere’s the view!
habs,lxt80dx,2024-11-18 15:16:32,Thanks for sharing. It was an awesome experience for sure. Bravo to the Canadiens and the Bell Centre!
habs,lxse7g6,2024-11-18 12:46:32,You gtfo once the game is done. You can chill there a bit after the game but at one point you have to go. I've been around 10 times for professionnal occasion.
habs,lxshw8e,2024-11-18 13:04:59,No there's no onsite hotel-like sleeping accommodations at Centre Bell.
habs,lxt3sv8,2024-11-18 14:55:00,I believe we were past capacity and had to pay a bit extra. I’m not sure what the overall maximum is but that’s a great question.
habs,lxtz6x8,2024-11-18 17:35:38,Booked it around the end of August.
habs,lxslkdf,2024-11-18 13:23:31,Including food and boose?
habs,lxtztzm,2024-11-18 17:39:05,What’s the max capacity of a suite?
habs,lxsk744,2024-11-18 13:16:39,Well there also people like you  who don't take the time to read other people's replies.
habs,lxshfju,2024-11-18 13:02:38,This is correct. Drinks are cut off fairly quick and we had to leave within 30 mins.
habs,lxsn4ny,2024-11-18 13:31:19,Booze included. Food was extra. We had a swath of stuff from pizza hotdogs and wings and popcorn brought in. They did offer popcorn and chips as part of the rental though.
habs,lxu0ay7,2024-11-18 17:41:36,I think it was 20 ppl.
habs,lxu9681,2024-11-18 18:31:46,everything okay?
habs,lxt0cxk,2024-11-18 14:37:35,Can you can bring in your own food?  In Toronto the suites in Scotiabank and Rogers Centre only allow stuff like birthday cakes all food is catered through the venue.
habs,lxtcpgy,2024-11-18 15:40:29,Surprised food was extra. I’ve been to many Suites at the Bell Center and from what I could remember it was all you could eat all you could drink. Maybe different suites have different rules
habs,lxt13qj,2024-11-18 14:41:22,Good question? I would expect it’s the same but we didn’t bother trying?
habs,lxtll6b,2024-11-18 16:25:01,Someone was paying for it. You can even order stuff that is not hotdog /fries/pizza. They have a whole menu to choose from with fishes pasta chickent etc.
habs,lxs8n89,2024-11-18 12:18:45,According to Laraque's friend Laine was working with Gerard Gallant.

habs,lxslwq2,2024-11-18 13:25:14,4 weeks. Book it.
habs,lxs3r2n,2024-11-18 11:53:54,It makes me so nervous when he brakes putting his weight on the left leg. I know he’s been checked and cleared to do all that it’s just 3rd party PTSD after watching how his knee bent
habs,lxs34jg,2024-11-18 11:50:44,:-)
habs,lxs7p99,2024-11-18 12:14:01,Pretty good accuracy for being rusty.
habs,lxsw1yv,2024-11-18 14:15:57,Love seeing Patty Laine working with Adam Nicholas! Looks like some good teamwork in the making
habs,lxtbbl5,2024-11-18 15:33:28,I'm a simple man I see a Patty video it warms my heart.
habs,lxs6j9h,2024-11-18 12:08:05,Looks like he’s about 2-weeks out
habs,lxsdryo,2024-11-18 12:44:24,If he does come back on time I think there are bigger questions here… such as:Why did the Habs doctor tell him to have surgery but 2 US specialists said that wasn’t necessary?
habs,lxsh8p1,2024-11-18 13:01:40,Next up: Laine cracks Primeaus goalie mask with wicked shot at practice.
habs,lxsaeka,2024-11-18 12:27:34,I don't know man that leg looking a little wobbly. He kinda looked uncomfortable on that second drill. Wondering if he still has pain.
habs,lxtiomd,2024-11-18 16:10:27,We player a game with that net setup as a goalie because our goalie no showed.Fking sucked balls was so hard to score

habs,lxsgth0,2024-11-18 12:59:32,This is great keep making this joke haha
habs,lxt0ro0,2024-11-18 14:39:40,Is it just me or was this rumor obviously true and the Habs would do anything to deny it.  Why make this stuff up?  Or the Habs released the rumor themselves hoping it would motivate the players to play hard for MSL lest they get Gerard Gallant.
habs,lxs7kox,2024-11-18 12:13:22,As a beer leaguer I think I'd go 1 for 100 on that
habs,lxsospj,2024-11-18 13:39:43,Egg shell leg
habs,lxsl4ny,2024-11-18 13:21:19,Not sure about that. He’s pretty chill on the knees and breaking.
habs,lxsssj0,2024-11-18 13:59:36,For sure. Road to recovery is a mix of rest and exercise to assess where he is. They are testing the limitations pretty sure he must still be  feeling some pain and having some swelling but its part of the recovery process. I still remember the pain from physio treatment and exercising after a similar injury.  He is on the right track but I am not as optimistic as others are. Give him time.
habs,lxt5895,2024-11-18 15:02:11,"If they wanted to ""truly"" hire him they wouldn't meet him in a public coffee shop lmaoLaraque just fucked up with his ""sources""."
habs,lxsiqb7,2024-11-18 13:09:14,So did Laine
habs,lxsu9n9,2024-11-18 14:07:02,Right. I'm definitely hopeful for a short term return but two weeks seems like a huge stretch.
habs,lxt6ana,2024-11-18 15:07:41,Seems to me the Habs used Laraque to get the rumor out.  Sources just don't appear with false information randomly.  Could also be GG's agent trying to get his name out there so no one forgets him.
habs,lxsl3kr,2024-11-18 13:21:10,I think they are more focused on his mobility than his shooting at the moment
habs,lxsiuws,2024-11-18 13:09:52, To be fair he did shelf a few after missing early in the vid
habs,lxte5f3,2024-11-18 15:47:45,Sources make stuff up all the time. Good journalists verify the info and if they can't get the verification they shut the fuck up.
habs,lxsn4b0,2024-11-18 13:31:16,His shooting looked shit before the injury we have a broken version of Laine.
habs,lxtmik1,2024-11-18 16:29:41,Sources make stuff up because they are getting paid to push a narrative.  Laraque certainly takes some blame even if he didn't take money himself for pushing something that *may* turn out to be false.  GMs talk to players and players through their agents to GMs all through the media all the time.  The relationships used to push this subliminal communication are established and greased and lost in this ecosystem.
habs,lxrqylq,2024-11-18 10:47:24,Demidov hat trick incoming
habs,lxs9uk1,2024-11-18 12:24:47,He will come to Montreal knowing more about adversity and fighting for ice-time (even if it's in an environment where he deserve more). Even if it's not ideal he will win another kind of experience and won't take anything for granted (hopefully).
habs,lxsa8sg,2024-11-18 12:26:46,listen at this point i kinda don't super mind him getting limited ice time because he already proved that he can still produce meaningfully even while not playing much so as long as they don't bench him outright he's clearly not gonna get rusty and i don't think its gonna stunt his development. plus the less he plays the least likely he is to get injured so 
habs,lxsh58f,2024-11-18 13:01:11,How many times does he have to teach you this lesson old man?

habs,lxsklfl,2024-11-18 13:18:39,He’s due
habs,lxs7jdr,2024-11-18 12:13:11,Is it really a surprise at this point? Ivan has been mismanaged all season at least he is getting some ice time and proving his worth with limited TOI.
habs,lxt40w4,2024-11-18 14:56:07,Let's take this opportunity to blame some people on this side of the Atlantic too.The Michkov situation in Philly doesn't exactly help us (the Habs brass more specifically). The KHL and many involved with it see it as competition for or a clear number 2 to the NHL.If the NHL has a team healthy scratching a young budding star because the focus has to be on winning SKA can't be blamed for taking a similar approach.I don't like it I don't agree with my assumption about what people in Russia think about the KHL or any of that.But I do think we should say fuck the Flyers for giving them ammunition. And also for 2010.
habs,lxst06o,2024-11-18 14:00:39,Less playing time is probably beneficial for his development.  We're slowly realizing that youngsters playing 20mins 60+ times isn't a good thing.
habs,lxsucfp,2024-11-18 14:07:26,20 minutes? Ivan is lucky to get 13. He finished with just under 10 minutes today. Anyway the coach can't break the kids spirit he just puts his head down and does the work when called upon.He got a shot off of a set play off a face-off for a quick goal. I thought he scored it originally. I guess it tipped in off someone.
habs,lxswwj3,2024-11-18 14:20:12,20mins 60+ was a dig at the CHL and Canadian junior in general.Ivan playing fewer minutes or even missing games is probably a good thing despite SKA's coach being incompetent.
habs,lxsylsu,2024-11-18 14:28:45,Yeah I get what you mean he has yet to miss a game though this season. [Highlights from today have dropped](https://old.reddit.com/r/Habs/comments/1gud5fq/full_game_highlights_ivan_demidov_shows_off/?)

habs,lxt66eg,2024-11-18 15:07:05,Savard back in Barron back out. I believe Struble loses his waiver exemption after this game so he can't be sent down any longer or he's at risk at being claimed.Big test tonight to see whether the recent surge in defensive prowess is a mirage or has staying power. Call me crazy but I ain't giving up on the season yet. This team is too good to finish bottom 5.

habs,lxrtdhk,2024-11-18 11:00:12,I found RDS through prime is MUCH better than their standalone product.
habs,lxrky8v,2024-11-18 10:14:34,If you can get them synced up properly that’s definitely the best way to enjoy a game
habs,lxrmk8s,2024-11-18 10:23:36,My grandfather used to watch the game on TV with the radio broadcast on.
habs,lxp642p,2024-11-17 22:04:49,Habs redditors loving Jake Evans is basically a meme at this point but we’re right! He’s great always plays hard skates fast and defends well. Gallagher’s renaissance has been well appreciated here and we don’t even hate Anderson this year. Dvorak now there’s an unpopular opinion.
habs,lxpumc7,2024-11-18 01:08:20,I've always loved Gally and always. This man has given everything he can to the Habs. He deserves the contract he has even last year when he wasn't doing some good. People tend to forget just how much Gally has given to this team. I hope he's here when they win a cup
habs,lxp6p4m,2024-11-17 22:08:36,Andy has been a defensive beast this year really making a new niche for himself (even if still a bit overpayed).Dvorak just makes so many dumb plays. He's good in the dot but his passing choices leave a lot to be desired.Gally is looking like old Gally. Slower but still effective around the net and always gives 100%
habs,lxp8cc2,2024-11-17 22:19:16,Anderson good Gally exceptional Dvorak I mean respect for the hot take but nah he has been absolutely brutal.
habs,lxp5awi,2024-11-17 21:59:36,I personally have no qualms with their play this year. 
habs,lxprnuj,2024-11-18 00:41:31,I think he’s below average defensively which is inexcusable considering he is completely useless offensively. Just being decent at faceoffs isn’t enough to be an NHL calibre player
habs,lxpbzu0,2024-11-17 22:43:39,Dvorak season was abysmal until msl paired him with Anderson and gally . He's pretty good now and is FO% is the best we have now
habs,lxqaff3,2024-11-18 03:53:30,MSL is trying to utilize Dvorak to suit his strengths and build him up. Might as well while he is here. You can see that he is feeling it more these days. Andy has shaken off that bad season he has found good outputs for his effort (pk) and has been really focused on getting in the slot. Gally seems healthy. Really happy to see all three in a good place.
habs,lxq89qy,2024-11-18 03:29:06,Bergevin enters the chat
habs,lxplf61,2024-11-17 23:50:42,Gotta give some respect to Joey Army. ( Armia )Those passes he made were just beautiful and there is nobody better on the man short.
habs,lxp94x0,2024-11-17 22:24:30,Just hoping that Dvo plays well enough (and doesn't get injured) to fetch something in a trade either way I don't see him on the team next season.
habs,lxphl85,2024-11-17 23:22:56,If Dvorak can build on his play from his games in Buffalo and yesterday then I won't have to many complaints.However the issue his that he always makes errors in the worst possible moments.
habs,lxqyrwt,2024-11-18 07:53:09,I will appreciate Dvorak when I don't have to watch him wear our sweater anymore. Horrible player.
habs,lxrfi78,2024-11-18 09:43:07,Right on. It’s not the biggest reason to celebrate but why not? They have been consistently good all season long and see no reason to think about breaking up that trioAs an aside I suppose management thought that at this point Evan’s has more upside than Dvorak and that’s a reason why they bumped him up to L2. Giving him time with scorers further increases that and our chances of good value in return at the deadline. Maybe they’ve given up on getting anything remotely of interest from Dvorak.Finally bigger picture here - is there a team that has WORSE C depth than we do right now? It’s SO BAD. After a very brief window of depth we are right back to where we’ve been for so long - poor performance from the C position.
habs,lxs8m90,2024-11-18 12:18:38,I just hope that Dvorak is gone for something useful on trade deadline. Same with Anderson and Armia. They do not fit this team moving forward.
habs,lxpgtlh,2024-11-17 23:17:29,Counterpoint: these vets share some of the blame for spending a chunk of their career near the bottom of the standings.
habs,lxpk2z6,2024-11-17 23:40:56,Andy and Gally sure and Dvo has been playing better lately but his defensive game is pretty atrocious. The guy makes errant passes up the middle of the ice that kept easily picked off and his play in his own end is consistently bad he’s always out of position.
habs,lxramu2,2024-11-18 09:13:15,Dvo has been better than any of forwards the last few games besides Caufield Suzuki and Gallagher. He gets so much hate yet does more then most of the other forwards
habs,lxpfs8o,2024-11-17 23:10:04,"""People trash Dvorak a lot but he’s our best center""  Say no more."
habs,lxq5o0d,2024-11-18 03:00:24,this timeline would be blessed
habs,lxqpqet,2024-11-18 06:37:42,Had they known Anderson is more of a defensive player most folks wouldn't have been so hard on the guy for not getting points. He's fun to watch on the PK but he can also be offensive when needed.
habs,lxp8trb,2024-11-17 22:22:26,524% on the Facebook and the forward with the most block shots at 17 come to mind.Edit: Faceoff lol
habs,lxp828l,2024-11-17 22:17:26,"Yeah they're all having small bounce back seasons which is nice to see. They're overpaid but that's still a ""luxury"" 3rd line imo. If our second line could get going when Laine comes back we might actually have quite a stew going."
habs,lxqw7rj,2024-11-18 07:33:31,yeah totally agree with you
habs,lxpkkkt,2024-11-17 23:44:30,Agreed. Seems like centering Anderson and Gallagher has given Dvorak a lot of jump to his game really like that line.
habs,lxq65h0,2024-11-18 03:05:41,It really would be
habs,lxpdyf6,2024-11-17 22:57:08,52.4% faceoffs isn't balancing the rest of his game out. He's a sub-replacement guy. I loved watching him play in London during the Mem cup run and I had hopes for him when the Habs picked him up from the depressing wasteland that was Arizona but he's just not the answer to any of the Habs' problems now. I hope he transforms into one of those early 30s defensive gurus who wins a cup because of that but it won't be with the Habs.
habs,lxp96ac,2024-11-17 22:24:45,Fair enough. His defensive play for being a two way player has been bad. His decision making leaves a lot to be desired to say the least. Faceoffs are something so that’s good. Won’t deny that.
habs,lxpcxwt,2024-11-17 22:50:08,One thing about his faceoffs I notice is that while he racks up good numbers on them he loses the important ones lol.As for blocked shots that just means he has the puck less.
habs,lxs8e1p,2024-11-18 12:17:29,This guy gets it. And if you are blocking that many shots then you never have the puck and you aren’t in position. I hate blocking shots. Leads to injuries and bad plays. Let the goalie stop the shots that’s literally his only job!!!
habs,lxoxwgk,2024-11-17 21:13:36,Hard to believe that Pleks played his last game with the Habs in 2019 and the only guys left on the team from that year are Gally and Armia.
habs,lxorl6z,2024-11-17 20:34:39,Plek looks younger than Gally
habs,lxpn658,2024-11-18 00:04:08,No circle beard? No turtleneck? What's going on with him?

habs,lxo0toi,2024-11-17 17:57:04,We don't know all the details. Would he have played here? Could Montreal have made him move to NA this quick? We're there other red flags? It's hard to know but he didn't fall to 7 with zero cause. Other teams also had doubts or grievances which makes me wonder.Based on what we can see yes they made the wrong call. But we cannot say with certainty cause we're missing pieces of the puzzle.
habs,lxo1nim,2024-11-17 18:01:47,If the rumours are true about him forcing his way to Philly then absolutely they made the right decision. Using a 5OA on a guy whom may or may not ever decide to come play is a hard spot to be in. 
habs,lxo18e0,2024-11-17 17:59:24,Let’s give each of these kids 300 games and let’s have this discussion again.

habs,lxo03ii,2024-11-17 17:52:50,Yup - if the Habs drafted him he’d still be in Russia.
habs,lxo25kw,2024-11-17 18:04:40,Who knows I need to see Demidov given the speculation they had him in mind while not selecting Michkov. In terms of talent Michkov is fun to watch though so good for him sucks Reinbacher is injured at this time but I have faith in him being a solid piece
habs,lxo3wh2,2024-11-17 18:14:55,First I love how most of the fans who wanted Michkov probably wanted Wright too but right now they are acting like they would be better scouts than Mtl front office just because the obviously good offensive player is doing what everyone predicted he would be able to do (being good offensively).Truth is we'll never know if it was the right call because we'll never know what Michkov would've done in Montreal. Or what was said behind closed doors. Or if he would've chemistry with our core. If the rumors that he missed 1-2 games because he said something to a teammate it goes against everything they are trying to build here I just don't see a fit between him and our core players. It might've worked out but there's absolutely no way of knowing so these posts are worthless.Remember it's not a video games there's more to take into consideration than the number of goals and assists.
habs,lxo0bfc,2024-11-17 17:54:07,We took the best D. Our team really lacks D. I'm ok even if Reinbacher doesn't turn out due to injuries
habs,lxoked2,2024-11-17 19:50:51,Well I BELIEVE we did because there had to be an incredibly compelling reason the Habs passed on him.The Habs had maybe the best info in the league from Bobrov so there’s a reason. Maybe it’s a personality thing. Maybe he didn’t want to play here.Or maybe it’s my own personal theory which I won’t state but it rhymes with “rush in job”
habs,lxo08x4,2024-11-17 17:53:42,Nobody knows if he would’ve even signed with just any team which in my understanding is why he fell as far as he did. I do wish we had him though
habs,lxo0g19,2024-11-17 17:54:52,Still too early to tell. If we took Mitchkov then we probably wouldn't have Demidov who appears to be a true stud. Reinbacher's injury has really made it hard to evaluate this decision.
habs,lxo1q5r,2024-11-17 18:02:12,If we drafted Michkov I don't think we draft Demidov.
habs,lxo0rq0,2024-11-17 17:56:45,Nope. Bring on the downvotes.
habs,lxo1uuj,2024-11-17 18:02:57,Depends on the ability to project in the future.One that's shortsighted and can't look further than a week ahead probably thinks the call was horrible because well they can't think any other way.One that has more long-term views based on the requirements of a long Stanley Cup run in mind probably still prefers the box Reinbacher checks over Michkov's powerplay show.
habs,lxnzefs,2024-11-17 17:48:53,Hi there! It looks like you've posted an image. If this image is from an article please provide a source. If it's a meme please ignore this comment.

habs,lxo66sy,2024-11-17 18:28:19,Regardless we have a glaring need for a top 4 right shot defender and Reinbacher has all the tools to be just that maybe even top pair
habs,lxohjp7,2024-11-17 19:33:59,If it's true he didn't want to play for us it's fine. There were some guys I preferred over Reinbacher but there close. If he had no problem playing here I do think it was a massive mistake. We've been begging for an offensive superstar for decades and he was there. So again IF he was ok with being here it was a big mistake.
habs,lxoohjd,2024-11-17 20:15:38,He did not want to play here . Get over it
habs,lxr816g,2024-11-18 08:56:36,We don't know know what went on during the conversations they had with Michkov and why they didn't go for him in the end. We also don't know how good Reinbacher will end up being. It's pretty pointless speculating without knowing either of those things
habs,lxrcs8k,2024-11-18 09:26:37,Hughes and Co. have done fantastic work so far and I don't think we should crucify them for this one decision. Yeah Michkov would be a welcome addition to this squad. But it's impossible to know if drafting Michkov would have had the same result for us as it has for Philly.Reinbacher looks like a great player and a great person. His development has taken a big hit but I believe he can be a Top Pairing D. Unfortunately the fans will have him on a tighter leash than they should. Which sucks.The worst part about Michkov playing this well is that no matter what Reinbacher does with his career it will forever be seen as not enough if Michkov is a 100-point player.I'm hoping Demidov plays elite and mitigated some of that feeling.I'm rambling. But yeah it LOOKS like the wrong move. But we need to rally around Reinbacher and the team rather than decrying this one move.
habs,lxrfbto,2024-11-18 09:42:03,Based on what they’ve done so far yeah I do think they made the right call. There’s more to building a team than goals and assists. These guys are professionals who clearly have a vision and are taking everything into consideration to build it. This isn’t Franchise mode on NHL. Clearly they and a couple other teams saw or heard something that made them decide to pass on him and we will never know the whole story. I wanted Michkov badly at the time and wasn’t happy they passed but after it was all said and done I know I’m just a dummy with a beer and a jersey watching the screen I have no idea what all goes into building a professional hockey team these guys know way better than I do. Since the day of the draft I’ve been all team David and you should too.
habs,lxrfrwg,2024-11-18 09:44:43,Y VOULAIT PAS JOUER À MONTRÉAL CÂLISSE
habs,lxss6ke,2024-11-18 13:56:35,I’m fine with the pick we made (largely thanks to Demidov the Redeemer) but I keep hearing the dubious narrative that Michkov “forced his way” onto the Flyers and I just don’t buy it. If there’s any truth to that then why do we have actual video footage of Jeff Gorton asking his war room if they were SURE about their decision because ‘elite talent is hard to come by’ or something to that effect?In other words it doesn’t make sense that Gorton would have been urging his team to reconsider their pick (Reinbacher) on draft day if there was any danger of Michkov refusing to sign with the Habs.IMO our guys made their pick based on perceived personality issues (i.e. reports from Bobrov’s dad etc.) and Michkov’s contract situation with SKA. They didn’t want his development to be at the mercy of an unsympathetic Russian club for three full seasons. And based on Demidov’s current season in purgatory I can’t say I blame them.
habs,lxt3ij4,2024-11-18 14:53:33,Well we got unlucky Reinbacher got injured. Doubt he reaches the same ceiling he might’ve reached. That’s not their faultOne thing’s for sure we couldn’t get out of the rebuild with Guhle-Hutson-Mailloux as our 3 best dmen. Would’ve been unacceptable basically Muzzin-Barrie-Rielly which was awful and heavily held back the leafs we wouldve had the same roster everyone keeps on mocking. Its also similar but worse than the Oilers and they cant win the cup despite starting every game with a 3 goal lead. Plus this draft seems to be one of the worst ever for dmen.
habs,lxo0eqv,2024-11-17 17:54:39,I heard rumors that he did not want to talk to our FO before the draft?Might be false but if true I get we passes on him.
habs,lxo3ij9,2024-11-17 18:12:36,None of us know anything about prospects is a good rule to follow when it comes to Habs fandom.
habs,lxobuyb,2024-11-17 19:01:34,Even if we ignore skipping on a guy with the potential to be a top 5 player in the league a guy like Leonard would have been a better pick too
habs,lxohhpm,2024-11-17 19:33:39,With hindsight you can’t say Reinbacher is the right pick.But maybe Leonard would’ve been a better pick than Michkov for the Habs.
habs,lxopiur,2024-11-17 20:21:59,I never thought Hughes and Gorton made the right call
habs,lxo05af,2024-11-17 17:53:07,No I didn’t think it was the right call then either tbh.
habs,lxo9u6p,2024-11-17 18:49:46,Did we ever? Reinbacher was a bit of a reach then and add a bad D+1 and a lost D+2 this seems like a wasted pickEven if we didn’t take michkov there’s a few players taken after Reinbacher that look like better picks
habs,lxo4vyn,2024-11-17 18:20:44,I’m not sure if anyone else feels this way but after watching a good amount of shift-by-shift footage of Michkov he reminds me of Caufield.What I mean is he isn’t very effective in any situation outside of scoring goals. While that’s obviously very important it is such a small part of the equation to winning. Neither excel at puck possession or board battle wins defence or physicality. Very one dimensional (Caufield however has developed his game more which has been nice).Demidov has so much more to offer imo. More ‘complete package’. Besides as our fan base has been complaining about defence lately imagine having Michkov instead of Reinbacher in the pipeline? Reinbacher was a important risk to take regardless of the outcome.
habs,lxo02sw,2024-11-17 17:52:44,Personally I think this was a serious drafting mistake. I don’t really believe the media spin of he stated he wasn’t playing for the Habs.  I think it’s more a symptom of the risk averse and sometimes arrogant culture of the Montreal Canadiens. I love the team to death and I think the rebuild is the right strategy but oh boy was this a major fumble.
habs,lxo4gp1,2024-11-17 18:18:14,No. And anyone saying he had an attitude problem or refusing to play for the habs has yet to provide a source.With that said I'm not so sure he has a good attitude. And I also don't think they pick demidov if they  selected michkov. End of the day a RHD was needed too so I get it
habs,lxog0nz,2024-11-17 19:25:20,Also what if Reinbacher wasn't injured that often and if Kloten wasn't a shit show last year
habs,lxrvfcb,2024-11-18 11:11:06,>Using a 5OA on a guy whom may or may not ever decide to come play is a hard spot to be in. Just ask Philly about that.
habs,lxpm3h5,2024-11-17 23:55:51,I don’t think he forced his way to Philly. That’s all speculation and habs fan base coping mechanism I think. Anyways even if he stated a preference Eric Lindros did the same with Quebec they still drafted him and ultimately traded him for a haul that set up their dynasty and 2 Stanley cup wins.  It’s all about asset management.
habs,lxo4w9e,2024-11-17 18:20:47,I don't ever recall a rumour that he forced his way to Philly. I do recall rumours that he didn't show any interest in going to Arizona or being in Ovi's shadow in Washington.
habs,lxp4w4w,2024-11-17 21:56:58,Let’s hope Reinbacher gets 300 games
habs,lxokj5j,2024-11-17 19:51:39,Especially with a dman. We might be disappointed for 5 years and then win a cup with reinbacher solid as rock and we will change our mInd
habs,lxois1p,2024-11-17 19:41:14,fr the pick was made and now all we can do is hope his development pans out. hated seeing all the hate reinbacher got when it was completely out of his control
habs,lxo16b3,2024-11-17 17:59:05,How come? Also are the rumours true that he didn’t want to play here?
habs,lxo32bk,2024-11-17 18:09:57,What tell you he wouldnt have change his mind? Also habs could have managed a McGroarty type of trade if at the end he woudnt want to play for us. Of course the kid had his preference and tried to influence his draft selection but nothing say he would have holdout in RussiaIt just irritate me a bit when people make a whole storyline of the futur of what would have happened
habs,lxrfpd8,2024-11-18 09:44:18,oouuhh I love a tin-foil-hat theory. c'mon let's hear it
habs,lxo57tk,2024-11-17 18:22:38,Is there a rule that we can't trade more than one Russian ?
habs,lxo19l3,2024-11-17 17:59:36,Ask and you shall receive
habs,lxoxedr,2024-11-17 21:10:27,"So....its never OK to judge a drafted player until \_\_\_\_\_\_? You're vindicated? The team moves on? Don't trust your eyes and ears and wait for the day that may never come? It seems very short sighted to just throw information away and twiddle your thumbs blindly hoping the player fits the draft capital 100 200 or 300 games in (or however many games is required to win an argument). Would Ottawa be short sighted to give up on or regret picking Boucher? Guy has dealt with injuries and hasn't even played a game in the N yet and people are calling him a bust! Just keep holding the bag and pencil him in as a sure fire second line player on a cup contending team I guess. No need to think about alternatives. It'll work out. It has to. They picked him for a reason ya know. I believe similar to money that it is best to acquire or place trust in a known quality (quantity for money) than bank on the loose promise/clouded vision of untold riches if you hold out. Especially when your money gets a knee injured before and after acquisition and misses out on interest.Its possible to have a short term evaluation while still having an idea of their long term impact based on whats happened in the short term. I'm fairly certain that is how all future projections are made. You know off current and past data and not just cost position height and hope. Whats short sighted is using Stanley Cup (always love best worst most always never level takes) arguments to justify not picking a player that is gunning for the Calder on a dog shit team. Such a cop out to lay down the ""well guess we'll see in 30 years"" carpet. Is a long tall steady dman needed to win the cup? Yes. Is a creative point producer needed to win the cup? Yes. Will those respective players help their teams ever win a cup? I have no fucking idea but if I were to take a stab I would say the guy producing impressive KHL and NHL numbers is a better lock for future impact than a guy that did ok and not looking out of place on a shit team while also injuring both knees during vital development time.Is it really longsighted to jump 20 years in the future and skip what has and what may happen between? Seems like a shortcut to me.Oh and if Slaf were a point per game power play merchant everyone here would be creaming their drawers at the future development of his 5 on 5 game. After all seems short sighted to write off any possible growth."
habs,lxo1ks2,2024-11-17 18:01:22,I think that's been debunked he did have an interview with the team apparently.
habs,lxob7em,2024-11-17 18:57:46,You’re missing Michkov’s playmaking and offensive IQ that’s the 2nd dimension of his game. His ability to draw in defenders and manipulate them in order find an open teammate is a step above Caufield IMO
habs,lxokxye,2024-11-17 19:54:07,I dont understand the downvotes. Sometimes you just gotta be real. Some people cant take that to well
habs,lxor3pd,2024-11-17 20:31:40,>I don't ever recall a rumour that he forced his way to Philly.because there wasn't one
habs,lxrbq6k,2024-11-18 09:20:02,Why so cynical? Hopefully neither him nor Michkov get career ending injuries so early.
habs,lxo3m7y,2024-11-17 18:13:12,The only rumors are that his father was a flyers fan and he basically tried to force his way to the flyers.We were one of 3 teams that passed on him sharks us and arizona.Got to think there is more to it as he was seen as being fantastic.No matter what though I do think it was a mistake. But that is also with the hindsight of reinbacher not trending to being a top 3 right dman.If reinbacher had been a solid dman with 30 to 40 points per year and defensively responsible who would play top 3 minutes I don't think it would be an issue.If reinbacher rebounds to that I'm not that worried but today this ain't great.A great comparison is caufield and cam york.Caufield would be leading the flyers in goals and is 1 goal off of the league lead. They took Cam York who is currently injured but when he was playing he was a 23 year old dman who is second on the team in time on ice per game.Scoring forwards are awesome but minute munching dmen are hard to find and fans undervalue them.
habs,lxo1u6y,2024-11-17 18:02:50,Exactly
habs,lxo2aub,2024-11-17 18:05:31,We have demidov. Stop.
habs,lxoqrtu,2024-11-17 20:29:39,>also are the rumours true that he didn’t want to play here?no some people have tried to make that a rumour because they want it to be true but it's not
habs,lxokqtq,2024-11-17 19:52:55,You mean draft ?
habs,lxob0r0,2024-11-17 18:56:41,Yeah that was pretty cringe on my part tbf. Just tired of how it seems any pessimistic/realistic opinion on this sub gets downvoted
habs,lxpdk8i,2024-11-17 22:54:26,Dude your post took more time to read than time has passed since that Reinbacher/Michkov draft.Less than 2 years is an insignificant span of time. I don't have enough fingers to count all the times one player starting his NHL career before another made all sorts of hot take artists spring up to say picking A over B was a bad call. This is just more of the same. Noise all of it.
habs,lxphx82,2024-11-17 23:25:19,My bad then thanks for the info!
habs,lxoch0w,2024-11-17 19:05:05,Yeah that makes sense. His vision is exceptional. I still think his effectiveness is limited though.
habs,lxpnvh7,2024-11-18 00:09:45,Ya. I agree. In the NHL sub this exact post had a comment from a Habs fan saying basically we wish we had picked Michkov over Reinbacher and it had a ton of upvotes. Clearly anyone that hasn’t drunk the koolaid can see that we picked a guy who was probably a late first rounder over a guy who is likely has potential to be a top 10 NHL player. It’s funny cuz for the past 30 years we have been wondering why the Habs just can’t become contenders and I think it’s poor asset management that is our Achilles.
habs,lxqs0w2,2024-11-18 06:58:21,There absolutely was a rumour. Elliotte Friedman reported on 32 thoughts that Michkov more or less engineered the draft to end up in Philly.
habs,lxrmi8i,2024-11-18 10:23:17,Yes sorry.
habs,lxpmt3u,2024-11-18 00:01:17,I agree. I find it interesting that this same post in the NHL subreddit had a comment from a Habs fan saying “wish we had him” and a reply saying sarcastically “at least we got Reinbacher” got a ton of upvotes suggests to me that the Habs subreddit is somewhat biased or influenced by their allegiance to the team. Not that there’s anything wrong with that just that it makes us way more similar to the leafs fans we used to hate that we care to admit. When I grew up I was proud of the fact that Montreal wouldn’t support losing/poorly managed teams. Unfortunately we’ve succumbed to accepting mediocrity.
habs,lxsisbu,2024-11-18 13:09:32,Yeah so many people calling Slaf a bust after his first season and how Wright should have been taken instead.....
habs,lxroit8,2024-11-18 10:34:18,There is no rule. The person was probably implying we would have drafted a dman instead of demidov if we had drafted Michikov the year before
habs,lxoewks,2024-11-17 19:19:03,Habs fans accept drunk Toronto and Boston fans don’t stress it you will be fine. We like the new Utah club it’s well managed mu better than the Arizona one.   I second the idea of trying to meet Youppi! With your kid. Best NHL mascot!
habs,lxnwl35,2024-11-17 17:32:47,You'll be fine.  Hockey fans from around the world have been visiting Montreal for over 100 years.  All of them had a good time.
habs,lxo868i,2024-11-17 18:40:03,Hope you and your family have a great time and enjoy our city! Habs fans are friendly to visiting fans very passionate but always friendly
habs,lxojydl,2024-11-17 19:48:12,It's Canada bro. Just come prepared with some amicable chirps.
habs,lxouitb,2024-11-17 20:52:39,Unless you're an asshole no one will do anything.If anything the comments you will most definitely get is people surprised to see Utah fans in Montreal.
habs,lxochqe,2024-11-17 19:05:11,You all will have a great time don't worry and enjoy the city!
habs,lxonl5m,2024-11-17 20:10:10,Welcome to Montréal. You will be fine! We are passionate but very respectful of other fanbases.
habs,lxoyh9a,2024-11-17 21:17:07,Enjoy your visit please.Wearing your jerseys is a time honored tradition across the League and and AFAICT every one likes a full arena with happy hockey fans in it. Montreal is more like a party we generally take the bad with the good and welcome other fans as if there were long lost relatives. Even Boton and Toronto fans (a hockey thing long time fans understand not to worry). Twin 7s? Great! People love it when the little ones show up. It means more hockey fans for the future. May the better team win BTW.
habs,lxp16kl,2024-11-17 21:33:58,I'll be at the game it'll be a cowboy themed night FYI. Have fun!PS loved visiting Zion and Bryce a decade back. Looking forward to going back and see more of your beautiful State.
habs,lxnxk0c,2024-11-17 17:38:19,Check if you can meet Youppie!
habs,lxq2x1n,2024-11-18 02:30:45,"your kids might learn a few quebecois swear words such as ""tabarnak"" mixed in with the usual ""fuck"" here and there."

You might get some light ribbing if you guys lose but nothing more. Generally speaking were a pretty peaceful and welcoming place except if youre from Boston or Toronto or the Cup is in serious play.

habs,lxpnx73,2024-11-18 00:10:08,MSG wasn't bad
sanjosesharks,lxu4l4b,2024-11-18 18:05:18,They're on a road back to back so I would expect that Smith at least will miss either Dallas or St. Louis.
sanjosesharks,lxtve7d,2024-11-18 17:15:15,Probably on the bench tonight as a backup and then will get a game in back-to-backs. He might play Thursday vs St Louis.
sanjosesharks,lxtzqws,2024-11-18 17:38:38,My honest answer is it depends on his performance and Vanecek's status
sanjosesharks,lxu4jsq,2024-11-18 18:05:05,In his article about it Sheng said that Mackenzie Blackwood would start tonight and then Askarov could start either of the back to back games this week assuming that Vitek is still not cleared for play. I would assume all three goalies will travel with the team unless Vitek can not travel with his injury and then if Vitek is healthy he will get the start and Yaroslav will either be backup or 3rd goalie again that is if Vitek can go. That being said my hope is Asky gets as many opportunities as possible but that has been my take aways from what I have been reading
sanjosesharks,lxu1dpy,2024-11-18 17:47:27,Listen I WANT Nabokov 2.0 hell I NEEEED Nabokov 2.0 but I'm not going to set any expectations for this season at all as the team itself is far worse than what Nabby stepped into in 2000. Askarov doesn't need to be amazing/ a franchise goalie for a couple years so if he has some struggles that's fine.
sanjosesharks,lxu2vu4,2024-11-18 17:55:43,i imagine money mike will probably start calling teams and seeing what he can’t get for blackwood or vanecek (most likely vanecek) if askarov is playing good. if not then he’ll probably just go back down when vanecek comes back
sanjosesharks,lxuakar,2024-11-18 18:39:53,Like others have said. He’s up until Vanacek is healthy (or there’s a trade) he’ll likely get at least a game. Blockwood is the starter (regardless of alternating starts) until he’s injured or traded. Askarov takes over next year as the starter at the latest (but most likely by the trade deadline if not sooner if a team who needs a goalie like Col is desperate sooner)
sanjosesharks,lxtvu82,2024-11-18 17:17:38,While I agree he's 100% as the #2 and just until Vanecek is back (ie - temper expectations) I think Warf has been ok about going back and forth between goalies and given Askarov's talent/ceiling I'm not sure he'd benched unless of a back to back situation. I agree with you we likely see him sometime this week if not tonight specifically.
sanjosesharks,lxtuatm,2024-11-18 17:09:26,Should be on November 30th when the trade went down. I remember because it was the best birthday gift I’ve ever got!
sanjosesharks,lxtyglr,2024-11-18 17:31:43,You can get there as early as you want. When you go in you don’t have to wait in the line you can go in the ADA (disability) entrance.  I would plan on getting there at least at 1245. I also have a parking pass. You have to set up an account with Ticketmaster (unless you already have one). That way I can transfer the tickets to you.
sanjosesharks,lxtuxn8,2024-11-18 17:12:48,I agree with you but it's pretty awesome that he's getting his own day.
sanjosesharks,lxtv6zy,2024-11-18 17:14:11,Oh yeah I don’t even know if there is a game scheduled in town that day and it’s cool that it’s so close to the same date.
sanjosesharks,lxtvo4u,2024-11-18 17:16:43,only a Cuda game on the 30th
sanjosesharks,lxtpo2l,2024-11-18 16:45:41,Forgot to add that Blackwood also signed my sign today. Yay! He usually declines so I’m glad to get his signature on it today.
sanjosesharks,lxtwe2a,2024-11-18 17:20:36,Hi how does one attend practice? Do you need a special ticket or inv? Or is it open to the public
sanjosesharks,lxtr88r,2024-11-18 16:53:34,Did you go to practice today? Because I was under the impression that they weren’t letting people get things signed anymore?
sanjosesharks,lxtwzuj,2024-11-18 17:23:51,It’s open to the public for free! They usually have the schedule posted here: https://www.sharksiceatsanjose.com/calendar/sharks-practice-schedule
sanjosesharks,lxtrsej,2024-11-18 16:56:24,I did go today! I haven’t heard that before. I’ve asked the staff there before about having players sign and they said it’s up to the player if they want to sign or not.
sanjosesharks,lxu9aof,2024-11-18 18:32:29,I believe you’re not allowed at the back lot anymore where the players come out after practice. You’re able to get stuff signed when they come off the ice but as far as waiting for them at the parking lot at the back. I think that’s not allowed anymore
sanjosesharks,lxttuzw,2024-11-18 17:07:07,Awesome thanks!  I have a couple of things I’d like to get signed so that’s really good to know
sanjosesharks,lxttc97,2024-11-18 17:04:24,I was in 218 for the Marleau retirement game and had a damn fine view.  If they set it up the same way again I’d say 116 would probably get you a really good angle on things.  I’d avoid the other side of the arena - last time they had it set up so the special guests had their backs to bench side of the ice.
sanjosesharks,lxtx80n,2024-11-18 17:25:04,If it’s set up like the Marleau retirement event the stage will be set up in the corner near 127/128 (where the shark head is normally located) and the best upper bowl views will be in 215-217. I was in 225 which was fine but everybody on stage was facing away from us and we were looking at their back.

sanjosesharks,lxtu1x4,2024-11-18 17:08:07,Thanks! Was just at Utah on Friday! I have Little Caesars  Scotiabank Arena and KeyBank Center left. It hasn’t been a completely clean list given that I’ve been slowly doing this since 2005 but have managed to get some old barns like The Joe Nassau Coliseum and The Igloo before they closed but missed out on Rexall and Philips Arena (RIP Thrashers). Islanders’ 3 arenas and Coyotes going from Glendale to Mullett slowed me down haha.
sanjosesharks,lxts5j8,2024-11-18 16:58:16,That sucks!  I assumed that the club level was in all the sections
sanjosesharks,lxtuiky,2024-11-18 17:10:35,The club section is only underneath part of the seating area (I believe the locker rooms are on the opposite side?) so only certain sections have access.
sanjosesharks,lxt5m2d,2024-11-18 15:04:10,For those unaware:Upper Deck still has the exclusive license to make NHL trading cards. These Topps Now NHL products are all stickers. Celebrini's official Young Guns card will probably be in 2024-25 Upper Deck Series 2 releasing at the end of March and Will Smith pushed to Extended. Michkov is up in the air but I would bet S2. Since they started doing an Extended set UD likes to arbitrarily separate the top YG chases out to sell more product like they did last year with Bedard and Carlsson in S2 and Fantili in Extended.
sanjosesharks,lxt3x88,2024-11-18 14:55:36,I’ve been working with his father since before the draft and it’s been fun chat with him about this.
sanjosesharks,lxtia8n,2024-11-18 16:08:26,That's cool. I started watching hockey about 5 years ago but the Celebrini draft was the only one I've watched. A rookie sticker or card of his is something I should try and get.
sanjosesharks,lxu2doj,2024-11-18 17:52:55,Kid looks like he could have been in the mighty ducks movies
sanjosesharks,lxtr6s5,2024-11-18 16:53:22,"Ah dang I didn't even think about Extended - I was hoping Series 2 would be ""loaded"" with both Celebrini and Smith but that unfortunately makes more sense! Hoping the photography for their cards is good! Between their regular YG or Canvas I would love to see either of them in the Sharks black alternate."

sanjosesharks,lxsmy26,2024-11-18 13:30:24,Awesome I hope he plays! I think him playing would tank the other two goalies value most likely so I imagine it's not ideal for him to play before blackwood or vanny are moved.I'm ready to see a forward callup from the cuda as well. Somebody with a little skill I would seriously consider seeing what bords can do on smiths wing if they had a big body to play the other wing that would be ideal. Maybe a possession monster like some guy we used to have...
sanjosesharks,lxtize8,2024-11-18 16:11:58,we are so back
sanjosesharks,lxtk1h8,2024-11-18 16:17:13,![gif](giphy|fH985LNdqFZXOFHygK)Apparently Blackwood is likely to start tonight though.Regardless we are on the precipice of seeing the future core play a game or a few together until Vitek heals up.
sanjosesharks,lxtlgsr,2024-11-18 16:24:24,Let’s gooo!! He’s been balling out! Great to see him get the nod!!
sanjosesharks,lxtpelu,2024-11-18 16:44:22,Is he playing tonight?! I already had tickets and that would be amazing

sanjosesharks,lxsr50o,2024-11-18 13:51:25,Exactly what was running through my head reading the post. I'm not gonna get too hyped but damn if I'm not super excited on a random Monday in November !!!!!
sanjosesharks,lxstvj6,2024-11-18 14:05:05,What?
sanjosesharks,lxsutam,2024-11-18 14:09:45,As was basically the plan for this year - we had two guys who have had kind of rough injury histories the last 2-3 years. Figured Askarov would come up within 2024 no matter what. Hope Vanecek is back soon but in the meantime I'm excited to see what Askarov can do behind this D.
sanjosesharks,lxsnxqt,2024-11-18 13:35:22,Those are in a Nabokov numbers
sanjosesharks,lxsrbno,2024-11-18 13:52:20,Can that be tonight ?!?!? I love when the Sharks beat the Wings as they're my brothers fave team. 
sanjosesharks,lxtkdbm,2024-11-18 16:18:52,The spirit of the Joner is always with us even if he's not on the team.
sanjosesharks,lxsmi89,2024-11-18 13:28:11,Vanecek left last game with an undisclosed injury. I haven't heard anything about his status yet but this call up is presumably in response.
sanjosesharks,lxsn55a,2024-11-18 13:31:23,We have a back-to-back coming up on Wednesday/Thursday against the Stars and Blues so if he doesn't play tonight he'll probably get the start later this week depending on how long Vanecek is out.I'm thinking he doesn't start tonight as the call-up is somewhat last minute but I won't mind seeing him play.
sanjosesharks,lxtd5ap,2024-11-18 15:42:40,Blackwood was first off the ice today at practice so make of that what you will
sanjosesharks,lxsmblx,2024-11-18 13:27:17,Vanecek was injured last game which is why Blackwood stepped in. Presumably Vanecek will be out for a bit hence the call up
sanjosesharks,lxstpf1,2024-11-18 14:04:14,I’ve heard that the avs are supposedly interested in Blackwood but this call up was due to Vanecek being injured in their last game
sanjosesharks,lxtfyxb,2024-11-18 15:56:47,Put on some weight?
sanjosesharks,lxtuid3,2024-11-18 17:10:33,They said # I get it. Im sick of losing shootouts too lol
sanjosesharks,lxtd2wd,2024-11-18 15:42:20,I’ve always felt a special kinship with the redwings. Maybe because they were the first team the Sharks ever played
sanjosesharks,lxts6iv,2024-11-18 16:58:24,The real Joner was the goaltenders we recalled along the way
sanjosesharks,lxsmtmq,2024-11-18 13:29:46,Oh I missed that. Dang he's been playing well too. Excited to see Askarov make his debut soon though
sanjosesharks,lxtcym3,2024-11-18 15:41:45,Day to day with an upper body injury as per our beat writers on twitter
sanjosesharks,lxsnn7r,2024-11-18 13:33:53,I don’t think he will start tonight… but my heart does. Home game. Aka I’d get tickets for tonight’s game. Blackwood played last game and traveled. Askarov rested last night at a home game.
sanjosesharks,lxso4zk,2024-11-18 13:36:24,I’m guessing he gets the start against the Blues and Blackwood will play these next two
sanjosesharks,lxsnol8,2024-11-18 13:34:05,Ahh that's right. That random 2nd period goalie swap.
sanjosesharks,lxsu1zt,2024-11-18 14:05:59,Georgiev just went on IR as well so I figured it may be linked. But Sharks won't trade if Vitek is hurt
sanjosesharks,lxtdmf0,2024-11-18 15:45:04,That's a fun fact that I didn't know.
sanjosesharks,lxt2tnr,2024-11-18 14:50:04,>  Aka I’d get tickets for tonight’s game.i wonder if the Askarov call up is why tickets are surprisingly not going for under $20 right now
sanjosesharks,lxtfds6,2024-11-18 15:53:50,That’s cause i made it the fuck up (Apparently Wikipedia says it was the canucks… fuck the canucks)
sanjosesharks,lxt4ykz,2024-11-18 15:00:49,Yeah I use Gametime and tickets are more expensive than usual. I didn’t see the same thing for celebrinis home game return though which is interesting.

sanjosesharks,lxqr2at,2024-11-18 06:49:47,What makes the barracuda competitive is the forwards are aggressive the defenseman place the puck extremely well from the point and both our tendies are good.What is holding them back from AHL greatness is they take periods off. They get scored on in droves on occasion.
sanjosesharks,lxqso7q,2024-11-18 07:04:04,Very curious as to how Mukhamadullin looks so far this year? Haven’t heard much of a report on him since his season started late after injury
sanjosesharks,lxqmi6p,2024-11-18 06:06:12,Cagnoni has the most boom potential especially on offense. He needs to work on his D more. His game and size is similar to Makar/Hughes. Small PMD/OFD. Gushchin as a forward is similar. Small and offensively gifted.Mukamahdulin should be a solid TWD (could be a top 2 pairing but def top 4)The ceiling on the rest are pretty much a 3rd liners (that’s not a slight). They can play solid two-way games and get you about 10-15 goals a year and 35-40 pts.
sanjosesharks,lxrqrgd,2024-11-18 10:46:20,I just wanna point out that Graf hasn't just been decent as a rookie he leads the ahl in points. He plays good defense has stellar vision for passing and also learning pk. I might be biased because i just root for the guy but i feel like he could be an invaluable top/middle 6 forward when he finally makes the nhl full time. The only thing i saw where i think he still has things to improve is positioning in front of the net.
sanjosesharks,lxqj4i1,2024-11-18 05:30:29,You never know until you know. These young guys develop at different rates. None of them have blow you away talent but might be a diamond in the rough. Bordeleau’s chances of making it are dwindling by the day to be honest.
sanjosesharks,lxrifhz,2024-11-18 10:00:11,The only one you didn’t mention that I think has a long term NHL future is Kasper Halttunen. And he’s likely a year or two away still. Everyone you mentioned has played decently and should be on the Sharks at some point in the next two years. Some could make an impact but that will be determined on how they play when they get to the NHL.
sanjosesharks,lxs1wli,2024-11-18 11:44:35,Amazing game yesterday!!
sanjosesharks,lxsohtd,2024-11-18 13:38:11,They should be the best Cuda team in years. Yes they have a lot more to be excited about and should make the playoffs. Yeah in my mind they have 15 legit guys who have at least some shot at the NHL hence our pool being rated at or near the top of the league. Half a dozen of them aren't even in the AHL yet so next year could be even better quite a bit better if defensive prospects like Dickenson Pohlkamp and Salin-Wellenius make big jumps.Some guys maybe don't make just based on the competition both on the current Sharks squad or other prospects. Bordeleau is an obvious one people have already discussed but he should be a huge help to the Cuda so long as he isn't traded. One other guy I would mention is Bailey. He is big and fast makes occasional surprising plays and his game translates well to NHL as a fourth liner. Again if they keep Goodrow around and such he never makes it but he's certainly a big asset to Cuda.
sanjosesharks,lxrv9h2,2024-11-18 11:10:14,IMO that's a coaching issue
sanjosesharks,lxtki29,2024-11-18 16:19:33,They seem to draw a lot of penalties and cost themselves with PP goals. Last Wed they got outshot by 20 and somehow still won. Mostly bc of Askarov.
sanjosesharks,lxsm0mo,2024-11-18 13:25:45,"I'm a season tix holder for Cuda. Caveat is I have yet to buy in at all on Mukhamadullin. But I think it's fair to say he's a long-term project at this point. He certainly isn't excelling at even AHL level. He has numerous things to work on. He hasn't been using his size much at all. He makes decisions often half a second too late or the wrong decision and makes passes that don't have the proper pace on them.I'm still hopeful they can add some bulk to him and coach him up. Reportedly he is very coachable. Cuda got pushed around on Saturday and you could almost hear the things that were likely said to him as he tried to be much more physical on Sunday and did a better job.Still I am of the opinion that you can't coach any sort of aggression nastiness or ""playing big"" into a player and he just isn't that player. So to me the hope is he can become a super-solid bottom pair D in 1-2 years for Sharks and use his size to body-up on opponents in the box in front of our net something the Sharks are sorely lacking right now on almost all lines."
sanjosesharks,lxtjcjl,2024-11-18 16:13:46,I don't think he's been bad but not great. Every Cuda game I've gone to he kind of is under the radar. He took a big spill on Saturday and looked out of sorts after.
sanjosesharks,lxqrfbg,2024-11-18 06:53:02,I mean u kinda gotta mention Colin Graff too he’s an absolute dawg. I wouldn’t say he’s entirely out of the conversation of top 6 as a winger. Buddy gets the puck
sanjosesharks,lxtk0tm,2024-11-18 16:17:07,He had a deflected goal in front of the net yesterday to tie the game with a minute left in the 3rd to push it to OT and win. Guess that answers some of it there.
sanjosesharks,lxrk0lr,2024-11-18 10:09:16,Kasper is no longer with the cuda
sanjosesharks,lxsmyqo,2024-11-18 13:30:29,It's also a talent and size issue. Look at yesterday at least two of the goals that come to mind were purely getting outmuscled in front of our net something the Sharks suffer from in droves as well.
sanjosesharks,lxrgfyl,2024-11-18 09:48:40,Graf has looked like he learned from his experiences in the NHL last season is listening to the coaches and will get a call-up some time this season.
sanjosesharks,lxsp1fr,2024-11-18 13:40:56,Yes totally. I also don't buy Mukamahdulin as a for sure top 4 guy but I'm rooting for him.
sanjosesharks,lxt1bgf,2024-11-18 14:42:27,He was mentioned by OP.
sanjosesharks,lxrl8qw,2024-11-18 10:16:12,Yes. I forgot
sanjosesharks,lxt1gr1,2024-11-18 14:43:11,So you think he’s a 5th or 6th defenseman? You’re the first to say that. Interested to hear why?
sanjosesharks,lxt4lyh,2024-11-18 14:59:04,I give the longer diatribe elsewhere on thread. Season Cuda ticket holder. I am watching a guy who game after game is not putting up points despite getting PP2 time is a minus player a guy who is not physical and makes some bad decisions and is costing the team goals at certain moments. He is not thinking or executing the game at AHL speed at the moment much less NHL speed.He's got a lot of room to fill out. He skates well and is reportedly a good attitude and takes and uses coaching. Obviously also coming off long injury.Given all the plusses and minuses to me he's a player with a very high ceiling and a very low floor at the moment. I'm not saying he can't be top 4 but unsurprisingly there is a lot of optimism on the sub and I'm just saying he has plenty of work to do and I don't see him as a sure-thing at all.
sanjosesharks,lxt8oy8,2024-11-18 15:20:04,Thanks for that. So your opinion is based more on where he is coming back from injury (and not up to game speed yet) Vs what he did for us last year and his development with NJ prior to that? Or is this the same opinion you had of him last year?
sanjosesharks,lxtb7my,2024-11-18 15:32:53,I remember thinking he looked good last year but don't remember actual plays and stuff if that makes sense. I'm trying to temper that memory with the fact that we had just watched one of the worst regular seasons in team history and were maybe a little over excited about call-ups like him and Boards.I have no knowledge of his NJ seasons.But I agree he does do a number of things well defensively at times (consistency will come) and given his call up performance let's add those to the plus column. It strengthens the case for a very high ceiling. I don't see much aggression and don't think it can be coached but hey in a super ideal world maybe the guy fills out and picks a few spots to hammer people. He doesn't need to deliver huge hits tho just learn to use his size more effectively. I still have hopes he can become like a really good #3.
sanjosesharks,lxtsl0g,2024-11-18 17:00:28,Gotcha. Yeah I’m going to assume if he doesn’t look good ATM it’s because he’s coming off an injury (and some players take longer to knock the rust off then others) he looked very good last year and had he not been injured would be on the Sharks this year (he’s better then half the guys suiting up on D)
sanjosesharks,lxrmmwm,2024-11-18 10:24:00,George and Walt’s is close to Rockridge BART. I haven’t been there since game 4 of the 2014 series vs LA for superstitious reasons but it’s less risky in a rebuild and it’s a cozy spot with good food options around and plenty of TVs. I’m sure you can get the game on there.
sanjosesharks,lxrmq7v,2024-11-18 10:24:30,Wouldn’t exactly call it a hockey bar specifically but the owners of Buzzin’ on Hops Taproom in Livermore are Sharks fans and will usually have the game on. Same goes for Porky’s Pizza Palace.
sanjosesharks,lxrrmf3,2024-11-18 10:50:55,It’s pretty rough out here and there usually aren’t any large gatherings of sharks fans at a bar unless it’s the playoffs. A few hockey-friendly (will at least put it on a TV and possibly with sound) bars I’m aware of are Line 51 Brewing Kingfish Pub Athletic Club and Rickey’s in San Leandro with the other three in Oakland.
sanjosesharks,lxqmpvy,2024-11-18 06:08:24,The Sunshine Saloon!
sanjosesharks,lxq3zrh,2024-11-18 02:42:15,Stanley’s at Sharks Ice 
sanjosesharks,lxrr6hd,2024-11-18 10:48:34,Came here to recommend George and Walt's
sanjosesharks,lxq4dy9,2024-11-18 02:46:32,Isn't that in San Jose? Just wondering if there are any hockey bars in Oakland Berkeley Walnut Creek or even Concord.
sanjosesharks,lxq5ve6,2024-11-18 03:02:38,There’s a sharks ice in oakalnd as well
sanjosesharks,lxq6n4p,2024-11-18 03:11:01,Does Oakland have a restaurant/bar?
sanjosesharks,lxq6qha,2024-11-18 03:12:03,I thought Sharks Ice is a merch / equipment store. Am I mistaken ? Am looking to find a hockey friendly BAR in the East Bay.
sanjosesharks,lxsi1qd,2024-11-18 13:05:45,No snack shack (with beer/wine) and 1 TV in the lobby. Not a place to saddle in for a game
sanjosesharks,lxq6wdo,2024-11-18 03:13:52,Sharks ice is an ice rink. They have them in San Jose Oakland and Fremont. And they have a BAR inside. This F’n guy…
sanjosesharks,lxt3vi5,2024-11-18 14:55:21,Gotcha. So only SJ and Fremont have Stanley’s.
sanjosesharks,lxq7dyc,2024-11-18 03:19:16,Got it and thanks!
sanjosesharks,lxq466m,2024-11-18 02:44:11,The Sharks Pro Shop carries a bunch of hats from non-Fanatics brands
sanjosesharks,lxqtj2o,2024-11-18 07:11:23,Can you buy a sharks logo patch of some sort as d have them sewn on?
sanjosesharks,lxqt570,2024-11-18 07:08:06,Mitchell & Ness has had some nice ones in the past. There’s also a site ecapcity.com that’s got a gang of hats. I’m being lazy and not checking if they have an actual sharks one. No coffee yet Mate. Game day baybay!!!!
sanjosesharks,lxq3hfb,2024-11-18 02:36:47,New era makes Sharks hats....
sanjosesharks,lxrp68p,2024-11-18 10:37:50,Any commercial embroidery shop is not going to touch trademarked sports logos. You can either get your own hat and put a patch from the pro shop on it or see if you can find someone on etsy that will do embroidery for you.
sanjosesharks,lxs4hqo,2024-11-18 11:57:40,To answer your question yes that's exactly what it means when they say they will not allow customization that uses trademarked logos. They can be sued and given they're owned by Fanatics who has the NHL jersey and merchandise contract that is something they would especially never let slide.
sanjosesharks,lxu9140,2024-11-18 18:30:57,I love the Mitchell and ness brand
sanjosesharks,lxq49j2,2024-11-18 02:45:12,I imagine you can find some company in China that would print whatever you want. I don't know about the quality you'd get...
sanjosesharks,lxqe7v0,2024-11-18 04:36:28,I just got a sweet New Era one
sanjosesharks,lxru430,2024-11-18 11:04:08,I’ve got a 47 hat that I love
sanjosesharks,lxso8az,2024-11-18 13:36:51,That was my final option if nothing else worked
sanjosesharks,lxq51bm,2024-11-18 02:53:37,Yeah I’ve seen them but I don’t really like the options any of the brands offer. I haven’t worn a new era hat in well over a decade because they’ve gone out of style. I was looking to get a very specific camouflage hat made with a sharks logo for my line of work. Lids offers the hat I was looking to get…just unsure if they’d print the logo for me.
sanjosesharks,lxq5ssf,2024-11-18 03:01:52,Yeah I enjoy the yupoong hats that I have now. Was looking to get a few of those hats with sharks logos for my line of work. They make the only hats I like wearing that’s acceptable for my uniform standards
sanjosesharks,lxr5350,2024-11-18 08:37:21,I also found a great new era option. I love the quality.
sanjosesharks,lxqp800,2024-11-18 06:32:53,47 brand makes camo models so maybe chceck them out
sanjosesharks,lxso2hb,2024-11-18 13:36:02,Yeah I have that one already but it isn’t the right camouflage that meets the uniform policy unfortunately. I wear it just for around town though

You can find us on Spotify too if you prefer that over youtube.
sanjosesharks,lxnjeeh,2024-11-17 16:20:13,Blackwood claims this team is close despite 3 straight losses all coming by 1 goal. Also Jake Walman and Klim Kostin get back into the lineup Will Smith gets time with Macklin Celebrini and the goalie tandem continues to improve their numbers. At the quarter pole we review players that have met expectations exceeded the bar or failed to impress. Fans haven’t seen that 70’s line but the Lunderful line is providing the lion’s share of offense.    Meanwhile several former Sharks made headlines this week bay area sports radio loses a big personality and the Barracuda face the top team in the division. Join us at 7pm pacific tonight in the YouTube chat.

sanjosesharks,lxp01kd,2024-11-17 21:26:49,Yes. Signed up day 1 for the 10 year plan. It never went anywhere and sucked. I consider it the most expensive hat I've purchased.
sanjosesharks,lxoayzv,2024-11-17 18:56:24,I remember when it dropped I thought the higher tiers were too much.Then it seemed they only did extra stuff for members in different states at away games like sitting on the bench during warmups etc

caps,lxtq1dt,2024-11-18 16:47:33,If he manages to do that it’d be one of the single best performances of a player in NHL history.He would have broken the goal scoring record cementing him as the greatest goal scorer of all time. This would only make him more untouchable. It would demonstrate an entire decade of dominance.

caps,lxsn63m,2024-11-18 13:31:31,Also why the hell is Patrick Marleau so high on this list?Sure he scored 566 goals in his career but that's only good for 24th all time. And he did do something of an West/East split but not really - he spent 21 of 24 seasons with San Jose and didn't score a ton with Toronto or Pittsburgh.I guess it's just a timing and luck thing. Most of the players on the all time goals list above him played at an earlier point (when teams were more likely to ride one goalie all season) and I guess it's just luck that guys like Stamkos (5 fewer goals) and Crosby (33 more) scored them on fewer goalies -- not to mention Ovi with 300 more goals!

caps,lxs3gbr,2024-11-18 11:52:24,I'll be the first to say that I was really skeptical about him getting the PTO and his chances this year.  However I'm happy to be completely wrong (so far.)  Great to see V settling in and he's been a major upgrade over Milano so far.  He's been through a lot and his NHL career was really hanging in the balance.  Def. making the most of what could have been his last chance in the league.
caps,lxs4qcy,2024-11-18 11:58:52,That last part is really what stands out the most about this whole thing imo. It really did seem like this was his last chance and 99% of the time this goes in the other direction for a olayer in his situation where they fade away into complete obscurity. Fan favorite or otherwise.
caps,lxs5e68,2024-11-18 12:02:14,Yea I really think he was Europe-bound if this PTO didn't work out here in DC.  Seems like DC is a real great place to play because of the leadership in the locker room and the coaching staff.

caps,lxrqpun,2024-11-18 10:46:06,"I didn't think this was possible he looked washed up in years past and had pretty bad starts. People were crapping on him for the cheetos and subway and it seems like in the offseason he got better in Russia and looked more motivated. I was skeptical when he went out there during the Caps 50 Fest and said ""We not going to be suck again"" but boy this season has really alarmed me. I'm not a hater but I do try to be level headed and avoid any biases."

Last I looked a few weeks ago it would be like $650ish for 4 nosebleed tickets together. The current trajectory I’d imagine those prices start ballooning since there’s a good chance Ovi could be in All Time Goal Scorer territory by March.

caps,lxrquly,2024-11-18 10:46:49,I mean his +/- is good BECAUSE he + his line is scoring at even strength. For a guy that has over 1/3 of his goals on the powerplay you’d expect him to have a lower plus minus than his peers but this season has been an anomaly for sure.
caps,lxry7cz,2024-11-18 11:25:39,Even though?

caps,lxt9nbf,2024-11-18 15:24:56,Eh it was a play on Sid the Kid.  Still would have been cool if Ovi was involved somehow.  Maybe practicing his one-timer while Crosby preens for the camera lol.
caps,lxt9nv1,2024-11-18 15:25:01," On the one hand yes on the other hand it wasn't ""Ovi the kid"". I think putting Sid in that commercial is perfect. It's odd how he can look like a kid and like a veteran player at the same time. Oldest kid in the league."

caps,lxs3a27,2024-11-18 11:51:30,Protas and McMichael have taken the next step in their development. That is 1a and 1b is we added a lot more scoring in PLD (hasnt gotten the goals but he is a good set up man) Mangiapane Vrana and Chychrun (added O from the blue line). Eller may be a small upgrade offensively from what we were getting from Lapierre so far. He is way better on D.
caps,lxrv2kv,2024-11-18 11:09:14,Sold TWO YEARS IN A ROW which is even crazier!
caps,lxt9a4c,2024-11-18 15:23:02, Best possible outcome. Ovi gets a strong finish and our future would be even stronger. The record is exciting and it's looking like we won't spend five years remembering that while we watch the playoffs and talk about rebuilding.
caps,lxs5xta,2024-11-18 12:05:02,The stro-pro-O line has been incredible so far
caps,lxs1ll6,2024-11-18 11:43:02,Yeah it didn't end up the way I intended to say it. What I meant was that Ovi's line is better overall this year on both ends of the ice. The last two seasons he's had a -38 despite scoring 46 even-strength goals.
caps,lxtjv4g,2024-11-18 16:16:20,Yes it was... He had a 4 goal game! 
caps,lxu71n9,2024-11-18 18:19:28,Agreed if we’re in the middle of the league instead of the bottom. I can see us hoisting the cup.

caps,lxt0uwu,2024-11-18 14:40:07,Eller’s board play is way better than LaPierre’s.
caps,lxt0sie,2024-11-18 14:39:47,Does it feel like compared to last year our boiz are causing turnovers and capitalizing on that transition a bunch more? I think another year of Carbs system RE: forecheck and transitional play has done wonders obvi in addition to the excellent development of our young stars (see above comments).
caps,lxtxw5t,2024-11-18 17:28:40,The biggest factor in the rebuild on the fly is the freed up Cap space from Backy Oshie and Kuzy. Having 24m in cap space gave them the opportunity to go for the big signings. It’s shocking how much fun this team is to watch this season.
caps,lxsn2tv,2024-11-18 13:31:04,Omg stro pro O - it’s meant to be
caps,lxt8rho,2024-11-18 15:20:26, I think +/- is an overlooked stat. Ovi was -38 and our team lost a lot of games. Pretty much the whole team was minus last season. The record is great and it's exciting but it's possible to be a losing team even while one player scores goals. I was an Atlanta fan when they had a team and I don't want to see Kovalchuk's style of play ever again. At least not on a team I cheer for.
caps,lxsdopn,2024-11-18 12:43:58,Co leading is still leading.    You must be a Pittsburgh fan huh?
caps,lxs81f3,2024-11-18 12:15:43,I was excited about Mangiapane Roy and Chychrun. I knew our D was going to be a lot better. I dont think anyone can tell you they saw Thompson being as good as Lindgrin (he's been better). I like you was worried about PLD but he seems to be happy being 2C. He is setting that second line up and he plays very good D. He is doing the little things like board work to show he is invested. I really want to see him score a few to get off the snide.
caps,lxt7t03,2024-11-18 15:15:29," Safe choices would have led to maybe a small improvement from ""didn't deserve to be in the playoffs and got swept"". As you say it was a masterclass.

At least not on a team I cheer for.Kovalchuck put his ego aside in NJ and became a monster two way forward. his last couple years he was the ENTIRE team there. he was on a PK unit he played the full 2 minutes on the powerplay he got a ton of even strength time. i think it was his final year that he had more TOI than all but 2 skaters in the entire NHL - Weber and Suter. he was out for like 10 games with an injury and the teams goals per game went down obviously but their goals against per game shot up by double.really wish he had just gone straight to the Caps on an affordable deal when he made his 35+ comeback. instead of the covid year when hes pushing 40 and on his way out of the league.

caps,lxr1i7j,2024-11-18 08:12:57,Against the canes jarko ruutu?
caps,lxreham,2024-11-18 09:36:58,Wasn’t there a hit on Marchand recently like that? Something like Marchand knocking Ovi off the puck from behind and then ovi blowing him up in the same play. I’m going to YouTube and will post a link shortly
caps,lxtuy78,2024-11-18 17:12:53,This is the one I figured it was if not the Marchand one.
caps,lxq1mm3,2024-11-18 02:17:08,Unfortunately not it either but that is some classic Ovi for sure haha. Appreciate the link
caps,lxq2hk5,2024-11-18 02:26:09,it made it to the highlight reel of one of the major sportscasters I remember that much because it was narrated over by some panelists who seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. Can't recall which network; I'm coming up blank for pretty much every important detail lol.Either way it was a great sequence and a quintessential example of Russian Machine
caps,lxrfg47,2024-11-18 09:42:46,This was backwards ovi blew up Marchand then got hit by pasta and marchand later on . Game 4 a few years agoOvi Hit on Marchand https://youtu.be/3PUFwVH6tCU?si=te0DCehFhEw7C4unPt 2https://youtu.be/KrSsazWUJ0s?si=QlAPryrp_DBLh7qp
caps,lxrqebu,2024-11-18 10:44:24,Really no penalty for hitting a guy down on one knee huh
caps,lxqikdq,2024-11-18 05:24:34,There are dozens of us who are also Orioles fans just imagine what's happened in recent years to all 3 teams.
caps,lxpuc8x,2024-11-18 01:05:44,It’s awesome to witness. I think the Capitals are built to compete and win now the Commanders are competitive but not quite there yet. We should be in a year or two. I hope we get the fairy tale ending with Ovi breaking the record and winning the Cup again this season!
caps,lxr2rmj,2024-11-18 08:21:44,It makes me happy
caps,lxr2u97,2024-11-18 08:22:14,Orioles have looked really good just wish the Nats rebuild would finish sooner.
caps,lxr8dcf,2024-11-18 08:58:45,Nats are like the Caps had a lot of competitive years with heartbreaks but finally got the goal.Orioles have been totally mismanaged and irrelevant for years they are like the Commmanders where it's like a dream that they are finally relevant.
caps,lxr2w14,2024-11-18 08:22:34,Nice

newyorkislanders,lxto3an,2024-11-18 16:37:42,Lose a season save a life. Fair trade.
newyorkislanders,lxtkmty,2024-11-18 16:20:13,Woah. Scary stuff. I had a friend die young from an undiagnosed heart condition. Glad they found it and are able to get it fixed up. Hockey is secondary to getting healthy (always but especially something like this)
newyorkislanders,lxtkfqi,2024-11-18 16:19:13,WHAT
newyorkislanders,lxtkxbt,2024-11-18 16:21:40,Holy shit

newyorkislanders,lxtmj6t,2024-11-18 16:29:46,Good to hear they caught it at least super scary stuff. Hoping for the best for Reilly
newyorkislanders,lxtnszv,2024-11-18 16:36:15,Damn. Cursed season for him. Hope we haven’t seen him play with us for the last time
newyorkislanders,lxtocoj,2024-11-18 16:39:01,Whoa. I guess that’s great though? Sounds like it’s a good thing they caught it now.
newyorkislanders,lxto2hv,2024-11-18 16:37:35,Either an ASD or PFO closure would be my guess.
newyorkislanders,lxtosyh,2024-11-18 16:41:19,Holy shit. Please get better Reilly

newyorkislanders,lxu4q40,2024-11-18 18:06:05,1000% no. There’s also supposed to be a six pack per person limit that I’ve never seen enforced
newyorkislanders,lxpq1en,2024-11-18 00:27:35,With how that event went I'm surprised they weren't straight up handing out free MAGA hats to everyone 
newyorkislanders,lxqt8yg,2024-11-18 07:09:00,Respect

newyorkislanders,lxsls7s,2024-11-18 13:24:37,Oof if there is one thing that would get me to wear a rags hat it would be a choice between a rags hat and a MAGA hat 
newyorkislanders,lxtnloh,2024-11-18 16:35:14,Cry more.

newyorkislanders,lxq7tb2,2024-11-18 03:24:01,Saturday-Tuesday is the best allows me to watch football
newyorkislanders,lxswipi,2024-11-18 14:18:17,You guys are still watching this bullshit? I checked out after game 4 when I saw we were getting the same product again. How do any of you get excited for this team?
newyorkislanders,lxoy30k,2024-11-17 21:14:43,You definitely have the right username lol
newyorkislanders,lxnmfp5,2024-11-17 16:36:50,Wherever you park I think you can ask for ADA assistance and they will come with a cart and get you.
newyorkislanders,lxo98pa,2024-11-17 18:46:14,Buy garage parking on StubHub or one of those sites.  You can take an ADA shuttle from just outside the garage entrance to the arena.
newyorkislanders,lxn5q0n,2024-11-17 15:07:24,Diamond lot. Can walk from there to bellmont hall in 30 seconds.
newyorkislanders,lxrb4na,2024-11-18 09:16:21,With Diamond Silver and Ruby your Dad will have a pretty flat level walk to the arena from the space. You'll probably have better luck finding someone to sell you Silver parking out there. Belmont Garage is also close but if he won't take the shuttle you're going to have to walk slightly uphill to get the arena. You would also have to use the elevator in the garage if you're not on the first floor otherwise it's steps. They do have a shuttle outside that can take you guys to the arena but it sounds like that's not an option. I would focus on trying to get Silver parking. It's flat and a fairly straight shot into UBS once you park.
newyorkislanders,lxos6w9,2024-11-17 20:38:20,OP father refuses to take a shuttle
newyorkislanders,lxnjvmd,2024-11-17 16:22:50,Thank you that’s so helpful!
newyorkislanders,lxnmdoe,2024-11-17 16:36:32,Going to be hard for you to get parking there.
newyorkislanders,lxnmk1o,2024-11-17 16:37:28,After that it’s ruby then silver A B C D distance wise. Honestly all three are close.
newyorkislanders,lxmjw6n,2024-11-17 13:11:33,The fact it’s crooked really sends the message
newyorkislanders,lxmwvut,2024-11-17 14:19:27,Give Season Ticket Holders 10% off Beers and Concessions
newyorkislanders,lxn4o43,2024-11-17 15:01:44,What exactly are we looking at here? Legitimate question from someone who has never received a STH gift and is not sure of what this object is. Looks like a picture in a box…?
newyorkislanders,lxnjsyv,2024-11-17 16:22:26,One of the biggest reasons I gave my tickets.Perks during the 1st UBS season and 50th season were great. Playoff tickets were at the season average price. Last season sucked. I can get my exact seats for 1/3 the price on tick pick/stubhub. Playoff tickets are never guaranteed and last season went up way beyond STH average price. The perks and experiences were terrible.They don't care and it's sad.
newyorkislanders,lxnn8cj,2024-11-17 16:41:12,I bailed this year after my three-year contract in the dime club. The customer service reps and the management are out of touch with the season ticket holders. Sorry to see such a pathetic gift for the year.
newyorkislanders,lxnrmcm,2024-11-17 17:05:15,This’ll go great next to my jar of dirt
newyorkislanders,lxpq6db,2024-11-18 00:28:46,UBS needs to bring their prices down I don't know why anybody would get season tickets at this point 
newyorkislanders,lxo09d2,2024-11-17 17:53:47,I think this gift is insulting. I am so sorry.
newyorkislanders,lxmo2mk,2024-11-17 13:33:45,Not saying it’ll solve anything but complain to the ticket dept. You never know. Maybe they fix it or comp you something.
newyorkislanders,lxmgz4e,2024-11-17 12:55:40,I feel for you
newyorkislanders,lxn2h7l,2024-11-17 14:49:42,I was happy with last seasons gifts.  Haven't gotten anything for this year yet I'm pretty sure
newyorkislanders,lxnw1cc,2024-11-17 17:29:45,I live in Virginia but got the full STH package for the first year of UBS. The gifts were nice: piece of net from the last game at the Coli the sliver tickets and access to playoff tickets. Name is still there I think. Couldn't keep em as I only went to like 8 games and my family bailed after saying they'd take the tickets. Couldn't sell them most nights so gave a bunch away. It was cool for a bit just way too impractical. Sad to see the gifts diminish.
newyorkislanders,lxrsx3d,2024-11-18 10:57:47,Lmaoo they just keep playing us year after year. Utah is giving away Mormon wives this year to STH.
newyorkislanders,lxnoidp,2024-11-17 16:48:11,Do they at least use a picture from where your seats are?
newyorkislanders,lxnr9pw,2024-11-17 17:03:20,I am forever happy for not renewing this year. I had an absolute blast the last few years but could tell the quality of benefits and the product on the ice was going down
newyorkislanders,lxo7gj0,2024-11-17 18:35:53,Serious question to STHs:Do you get better value from your plan vs buying one-offs from the secondary market?
newyorkislanders,lxr8lz7,2024-11-18 09:00:18,Actually it's perfect - it aligns perfectly with the half-assed effort & levels of incompetence night in & night out.
newyorkislanders,lxpha8i,2024-11-17 23:20:50,Is this just for full STH?  Us half season people really get the shaft lol.
newyorkislanders,lxr8lx5,2024-11-18 09:00:18,The packaging is nicer than the gift that says something.  And everyone got the same picture not like a view from your actual seat which would show at least some effort.
newyorkislanders,lxswwe0,2024-11-18 14:20:11,Stop spending money on this team. Send the message. They suck anyway so no offense but jokes on you guys for still paying for a shitty product.
newyorkislanders,lxtod85,2024-11-18 16:39:05,You have to be an absolute sucker to buy season tickets to watch this garbage.They’re laughing at you. That’s what this gift means. 
newyorkislanders,lxu3445,2024-11-18 17:56:59,The new islander fans are a sad group
newyorkislanders,lxml7xa,2024-11-17 13:18:39,This is pathetic?  The whole fucking team is pathetic!
newyorkislanders,lxn7f4c,2024-11-17 15:16:37,Sad to say butthe franchises is a joke now
newyorkislanders,lxn7ihl,2024-11-17 15:17:08,The whole franchise is pathetic… sell the team already
newyorkislanders,lxmwfvg,2024-11-17 14:17:07,If it’s like the other similar STH items I’ve seen it’s just a paper or card in a thick magnetic case like a one-touch case for a collectible card. So it’s likely it just shifted in its case and can be realigned. Still pretty lackluster for a STH gift though.
newyorkislanders,lxnjwbe,2024-11-17 16:22:57,They never will.
newyorkislanders,lxnhoa2,2024-11-17 16:10:48,Thats straight up what it is. It's supposed to be like a commemorative copy of your ticket with your seat number row and section. But in all reality it is just a small print of a picture of the arena sliding around between two pieces of glass.
newyorkislanders,lxnk4em,2024-11-17 16:24:10,They will laugh in your face.
newyorkislanders,lxo0knc,2024-11-17 17:55:37,Not it was the same picture for all
newyorkislanders,lxnk864,2024-11-17 16:24:46,From a STH perspective that isn't far off. There's a ton of redeeming qualities however. UBS arena is still great.
newyorkislanders,lxnw44e,2024-11-17 17:30:11,“Now”? Were you not paying attention from 1994 to 2019?
newyorkislanders,lxmyqan,2024-11-17 14:29:17,Ah yeah I see now it’s just an upsized one touch. Still amusing however.
newyorkislanders,lxnk37r,2024-11-17 16:23:59,To this point when UBS opened STH got silver plated tickets. 5oth anniversary STH members got a brick commemorative gold puck and other items. Last year we got a blanket. Then there's this for this season.
newyorkislanders,lxnq0zr,2024-11-17 16:56:29,Damn. That’s seriously an insult. Im not someone who usually gets particular about “free gifts” (free after you pay us a lot of money) but I almost would rather not get anything over something that poorly executed.
newyorkislanders,lxtojdd,2024-11-18 16:39:57,This.
newyorkislanders,lxo3625,2024-11-17 18:10:35,I thought when they build the new arena it would change things it got worse nobody wants to play with them
newyorkislanders,lxo2ywe,2024-11-17 18:09:23,Fan since 78 franchise is a joke now… I’m a fan too long to care what you say
newyorkislanders,lxnqhn7,2024-11-17 16:59:01,Not sure of the blanket quality but At least Even a cheaply made gimmicky blanket can be useful. Whatever this is…I’m sure people would have preferred to wait a little longer to get something more tasteful.
newyorkislanders,lxnuajf,2024-11-17 17:20:05,I’m still mad I never got my silver plated tickets
newyorkislanders,lxo7swx,2024-11-17 18:37:55,Everyone they traded for signed contracts to extend their tenure here
newyorkislanders,lxoxlmu,2024-11-17 21:11:43,“I started rooting for a dynasty and now they aren’t one and I’m mad” -Spoiled old Long Islanders are the reason I don’t go to games anymore. Move to Florida with the rest of the ignorant geezers.
newyorkislanders,lxnqzac,2024-11-17 17:01:41,I paid over 7 grand for tickets and got a blanket in return. The New York islanders Sth experience personified.
newyorkislanders,lxnrep4,2024-11-17 17:04:05,Agreed. Yeah I guess I was just thinking of the blankets I’ve gotten for participating in races. They were cheaply made but still kinda fun. HUGE difference I forgot to factor: I paid maybe at most $50 to enter said races.
newyorkislanders,lxoat3p,2024-11-17 18:55:26,That’s really disappointing to hear. They should let you get something from isle lab for free
newyorkislanders,lxogdxx,2024-11-17 19:27:20,We got 20% off or something like that. But considering everything at isleslab is expensive already it was negligible
newyorkislanders,lxp2h8t,2024-11-17 21:41:59,And the code doesn't require you to be a STM it's NYIMEMBER
newyorkislanders,lxp6aew,2024-11-17 22:05:57,Even more true!

newyorkislanders,lxm6l0t,2024-11-17 11:57:59,I think of Miroslav Satan just because I have a hockey card with him wearing this.

newyorkislanders,lxo92d7,2024-11-17 18:45:12,I always love picking these when I face the Islanders in EA games; shame they didn’t have a longer lifespan
newyorkislanders,lxoaldz,2024-11-17 18:54:10,Wore my peca jeresy to the game 2 weeks ago.
newyorkislanders,lxocl39,2024-11-17 19:05:43,Richard Park
newyorkislanders,lxoe9i4,2024-11-17 19:15:29,Alexei Yashin. First time I had seen someone wear that jersey IRL he had Yashin on it. Idk why I remember that but here we are!
newyorkislanders,lxoeomq,2024-11-17 19:17:48,Yashin
newyorkislanders,lxoxn5p,2024-11-17 21:11:59,Jason Blake
newyorkislanders,lxp7jfy,2024-11-17 22:14:03,Adrian Aucoin .. was our #1 d-man led the league in minutes during his contract season then left in free agency to the Canucks I think and was never heard from again. This is off the top of my head the facts might not be entirely accurate
newyorkislanders,lxplzuq,2024-11-17 23:55:06,I have the same jersey and the player I have was Peca

newyorkislanders,lxr0s7n,2024-11-18 08:07:49,They need to bring this jersey back in some capacity. This should have been a reverse retro! Oh and Yashin

newyorkislanders,lxrxw7z,2024-11-18 11:24:02,"I have one autographed by Richard Park so I'll always associate him with it. It was sent to me by the Isles during off season as a surprise STH gift and for the longest time I thought it was Andy Hilbert that signed it but I didn't realize there was a sheet inside the package that said signed by Richard Park. I thought the ""10"" he signed was and ""11"". lol and the dogs were all incoherent.This season we got a cheap commemorative tickets inside two slabs of plastic."

newyorkislanders,lxm46hi,2024-11-17 11:44:46,had a great rookie season and was a finalist for the Calder but he never came close to that level in years after. Was perfect for the dead puck era because he didnt skate well but once the game picked up again he was left for dead. A shame.
newyorkislanders,lxqpnuc,2024-11-18 06:37:03,Loved Hunter.
newyorkislanders,lxm3vfo,2024-11-17 11:43:05,How did I not think of Yashin ffs.
newyorkislanders,lxmgeyy,2024-11-17 12:52:35,Definitely
newyorkislanders,lxnjhl1,2024-11-17 16:20:43,They used to be my two favorite player when I was younger.  They should bring back these jerseys
newyorkislanders,lxpxtrw,2024-11-18 01:38:55,I have this jersey with both peca and yashin on it.
newyorkislanders,lxs403e,2024-11-18 11:55:10,I always think of water wings when it comes to park
newyorkislanders,lxm78dq,2024-11-17 12:01:37,One Jason Blake story I will share is that after 9/11 the Islanders held an event for families who lost a loved one at Christopher Morley park. Blake was there along with Eric Cairns and a few others. He made a real effort to interact with the kids on the ice and let me catch him in a game of tag. I also fell during the event and had someone step on my finger while I was down. He came by and checked in on me while I was getting patched up as well.
newyorkislanders,lxnd2g2,2024-11-17 15:46:54,He lived in a neighborhood by me and his wife gave out full sized candy bars on Halloween. Does that count as fan interaction?
newyorkislanders,lxmrpgw,2024-11-17 13:52:33,I met him standing in line at Ralph's. He was quiet but not unfriendly.
newyorkislanders,lxpw1op,2024-11-18 01:21:44,I remember him absolutely hating the fans who waited for autographs after games. He would tear out of there in his car wheels screeching even as other players stopped for autographs for kids. 
newyorkislanders,lxm4tf1,2024-11-17 11:48:16,Remember when he ended up in Toronto with Tie Domi.
newyorkislanders,lxnk4cp,2024-11-17 16:24:09,My Satan pumpkin jersey is my favorite one
newyorkislanders,lxqpvcf,2024-11-18 06:38:59,Me too!
newyorkislanders,lxnn6a5,2024-11-17 16:40:54,this one
newyorkislanders,lxnpxuu,2024-11-17 16:56:00,The Polish prince
newyorkislanders,lxm4eb5,2024-11-17 11:45:58,Was happy when he made a finals run with the Oilers. But lol at him ending up in Toronto with Tie Domi.
newyorkislanders,lxmcraq,2024-11-17 12:32:19,I’ve never seen a person have a good interaction with him honestly. He used to run from the fans after practices. Not even stop to sign for kids who were real young. Even Tavares was better at that and he wasn’t known for his larger then life personality. Peca rubbed me the wrong way as well. Guy came out with a bundle of sticks post practice and straight up gave to every other kid except myself. We were all in the same age range too so it wasn’t even that.
newyorkislanders,lxs4klt,2024-11-18 11:58:03,That move by Darcy Tucker completely snuffed out that isles season. If they beat Toronto it wouldn’t have surprised me if they went to the final bc they dominated the canes that season and that was one of the teams TML had to play next  (I think it was the ECF)Really loved that 01/02 team. I remember the excitement at the coliseum the first time in my life. They were like 9-0-1 when I went to one of the games and people were like “this can’t be real”
newyorkislanders,lxmxr3p,2024-11-17 14:24:01,Peca handing out a bundle of sticks after a random practice sounds like he was a great dude…
newyorkislanders,lxmeddr,2024-11-17 12:41:19,Have you tried not being ugly?
newyorkislanders,lxmgk57,2024-11-17 12:53:23,Once and then I realized there’s more to life then beauty and following terrible sports franchises.
newyorkislanders,lxmkgcw,2024-11-17 13:14:35,Keep in mind we have the following free agents:Ufa:Nelson Palmieri Fasching Martin Reilly Hutton cholowskiRfa:Tsyplakov Dobson Romanov wahlstrom Holmstrom
newyorkislanders,lxm2xwz,2024-11-17 11:37:59,More room for us to sign Mitch Marner I guess....
newyorkislanders,lxm85gu,2024-11-17 12:06:42,engvall contract looking better every day
newyorkislanders,lxnthuo,2024-11-17 17:15:40,Wow that’s a lot of money we can use for 4th liners
newyorkislanders,lxo8xc4,2024-11-17 18:44:24,Lou is gonna extend jgp and anders on 7/1
newyorkislanders,lxmvny2,2024-11-17 14:13:02,Incoming 7 year deals for Nelson and palmeri
newyorkislanders,lxn23rg,2024-11-17 14:47:38,If we are being honest the only ones I can see us resigning in the UFA section are Nelson Palmieri and Reilly (if the first two aren’t traded before the deadline).
newyorkislanders,lxrxk40,2024-11-18 11:22:17,Ugh I just threw up in my mouth a little bit
newyorkislanders,lxoycmt,2024-11-17 21:16:19,Yeah because every day it gets closer to expiring lol
newyorkislanders,lxn6xvk,2024-11-17 15:14:05,With the emergence of George I think Reilly becomes very expendable. You could let Nelson walk and target signing palms and tsyplakov. Potentially another ufa depending on cap space. Hate letting Nelson go but this kinda worksDuclair-Barzal-PalmieriTsyplakov-Horvat-PageauLee-Cizikas-HolmstromEngvall-Maclean-wahlstrom? Could be anyone reallyRomanov-Dobson George-PulockPelech-Mayfield
newyorkislanders,lxnu1kx,2024-11-17 17:18:44,This is not an insult to you because it's the reality that we will soon face but: WOOF this team would absolutely stink. By next season those bottom two lines will belong in the AHL and the top two are mostly middle sixers. Plus if Varly retires or just falls off at age 37 Sorokin will be end up being worked to the bone.
newyorkislanders,lxovine,2024-11-17 20:58:46,I don't think it makes Reilly expendable I think it makes Pelech or Pulock expendable.  George is a defensive dman
newyorkislanders,lxoufw1,2024-11-17 20:52:09,Lee having a great year turns into an AHL player next year? Overpaid sure but AHL? Maybe we watch the next 60 games before digging graves.
newyorkislanders,lxp7ow3,2024-11-17 22:15:02,He’ll be a 35 year old power forward. I love Anders but he’s already been on a downward trajectory for years. I don’t suddenly think he’s returned to peak form after less than 20 games this season.I was being a little hyperbolic overall but this team will not get better by keeping the same aging players and subtracting Brock Nelson. After this year we’ll need to tear it down.
newyorkislanders,lxrsv5s,2024-11-18 10:57:30,I mean I disagree with you but I’m not a “Cup or blow it up” fan. If some of our younger players get more run this year I think guys like Holmstrom Romanmov George and Tsyp have room to grow for sure. Imagine if Noah Dobson learned how to take a hit! And then we have one of the best goalies in hockey. If you want guys to develop getting playoff experience at a young age tends to accelerate that progress even if you are part of the 97% of teams that don’t win it all each year.

newyorkislanders,lxigr7d,2024-11-16 18:43:07,Awful call on that non-icing
newyorkislanders,lxigcn6,2024-11-16 18:40:36,I wonder if the players are as sick as we are of giving up a fucking goal immediately after scoring. It's beyond a pattern.
newyorkislanders,lxigcwh,2024-11-16 18:40:39,They really did deserve better than that. They played a strong game. Questionable goalie interference I personally think it was but who knows. Agree with the challenge. 
newyorkislanders,lxinl7p,2024-11-16 19:25:12,Funny how strict liability only counts for Isles. Tkachuk can cross check Varly Mc David can trip Wahly and a bloke can skate through crease and bump into Ilya
newyorkislanders,lxijsh6,2024-11-16 19:01:53,Deserved that win we were the better team but sometimes she goes sometimes she doesn’t. Way she goes boys
newyorkislanders,lxigj2f,2024-11-16 18:41:44,all three goals are rough ones. unlucky bounce break away and imo GI. Sorokin wasnt given the room to slide to the left. they didnt play bad but some real lapses in defense cost us.
newyorkislanders,lxihl3y,2024-11-16 18:48:19,Actually don’t like the GI challenge. Too risky to take away 2 mins off the clock trying to tie it up as it was borderline at best. Hope the intensity keeps up.
newyorkislanders,lxih1mu,2024-11-16 18:44:56,Got no favors in the last few minutes there.
newyorkislanders,lxis5i0,2024-11-16 19:53:17,Just came for the whiny bitches who were quiet the last five games and HERE THEY ARE! They played pretty well and got hosed shut the fuck up.
newyorkislanders,lxignly,2024-11-16 18:42:30,Nelson should have at least brought us to overtime(and lose)
newyorkislanders,lxigecu,2024-11-16 18:40:54,As far as west coast matinee performances go... not bad.But other than that I'm pissed.
newyorkislanders,lxigxmr,2024-11-16 18:44:14,FUUUUCCKK. That is all
newyorkislanders,lxih2lu,2024-11-16 18:45:06,We did pretty good on the road considering
newyorkislanders,lxigsnl,2024-11-16 18:43:22,They can't even win a west coast Saturday matinee against a team they’re better than on paper beLIeve is back on the shelf until they are so back.
newyorkislanders,lxihlhd,2024-11-16 18:48:22,Lost because everyone was talking about the point streak point streak OVAH
newyorkislanders,lxihmm3,2024-11-16 18:48:34,Pain has returned
newyorkislanders,lxinpg4,2024-11-16 19:25:55,at least I had beer for this one
newyorkislanders,lxitrso,2024-11-16 20:03:23,The goalie interference was fine. The not putting time on the clock was unacceptable. The non-icing was atrocious. Meh. Whatever. At least I got to hear Butch call Thomas Hickey Brendan. And then Shannon. That almost makes up for it. And fuck solostove. 
newyorkislanders,lxigp5v,2024-11-16 18:42:46,We just got zero bounces our way at the end of the third
newyorkislanders,lxigncu,2024-11-16 18:42:28,Mayfield sucks
newyorkislanders,lxj2jn5,2024-11-16 20:58:51,One of those calls where if its us that scores it its wiped out. Another team scores it its a toss up they go with the call on the ice. No problem w challenge. Refs were ass last 5 minutes
newyorkislanders,lxjsetp,2024-11-16 23:59:06,The missed coverage on McCann was the game. This team is who they are. They have an identity of blowing leads late in games and today was no different. They should have been able to hold on and win this one. Once McCann scored the Islanders played not to lose and the Kraken played to win. The Kraken eventually got the bounce they needed to win. It's mental or physical at this point because it happens way too frequently to be unlucky.
newyorkislanders,lxjz7fv,2024-11-17 00:54:50,Need to shoot more they were too pretty at times or looking for a slam dunk that was not there. They seem to fumble their opportunities like the 3 on 1 that Dobson messed up and the extended zone time that they didn't even get a shot on net and inadvertly passed it out of the zone. These are the reasons why this team is going nowhere fast.
newyorkislanders,lxigobu,2024-11-16 18:42:38,We got reffed but the reality is we should be putting teams like that away if we were any good
newyorkislanders,lxihu00,2024-11-16 18:49:50,Is there a team that deflects more pucks into their own net? I’m so tired of seeing it. Nelson is just standing there like a big fucking string bean. Block the puck or get out of the way.
newyorkislanders,lxjtlja,2024-11-17 00:08:36,Has anyone seen Horvat?![gif](giphy|3o7aTskHEUdgCQAXde|downsized)
newyorkislanders,lxigoik,2024-11-16 18:42:40,Another blown lead
newyorkislanders,lxihnn4,2024-11-16 18:48:45,Right?!?
newyorkislanders,lxinoqu,2024-11-16 19:25:48,Refs had a plane to catch
newyorkislanders,lxigyqy,2024-11-16 18:44:26,Seeing as it keeps happening probably not lol
newyorkislanders,lxihkt0,2024-11-16 18:48:15,Idk how sorkin was supposed to have time to adjust .5 seconds after being bumped into
newyorkislanders,lxigpek,2024-11-16 18:42:49,Agreed. They played a better game imo. 
newyorkislanders,lxijof6,2024-11-16 19:01:12,I didn't think it would go our way but I understand why he took it. We suck 6 on 5 there was a small chance it got the goal turned over
newyorkislanders,lxiovfs,2024-11-16 19:33:04,I think the situation was pretty close where it could go either way.  Like the other reply said we suck at 6v5 so challenging a close call like this wasn’t a horrible play in my opinion
newyorkislanders,lxjwr5x,2024-11-17 00:35:00,Wow what a dumb take We didn’t mean to upset the badass that is heavy metal fucking lilac lmao
newyorkislanders,lxijng1,2024-11-16 19:01:02,Would’ve at least been a point. Come April we’ll be looking back on these games.
newyorkislanders,lxik7e8,2024-11-16 19:04:28,I feel the same way.
newyorkislanders,lxjyssw,2024-11-17 00:51:26,You don't get bounces if you aren't playing to win.
newyorkislanders,lxiwg0t,2024-11-16 20:20:21,He looked totally lost and out of way out of position on that breakaway goal that tied it up.
newyorkislanders,lxirp2p,2024-11-16 19:50:29,Wow what a dumb take.
newyorkislanders,lxiiu1n,2024-11-16 18:56:01,That would be a weak GI call. If sorokin was centered that puck never goes in. He slid so goddamn far out of the way. He did that a lot last year where he would over push to a side. He’s fixed that so far this year.
newyorkislanders,lxiqyxc,2024-11-16 19:45:59,Indeed. I could go either way. We just don't usually get those calls
newyorkislanders,lxl3o5c,2024-11-17 07:51:21,Lol did they not get hosed or play pretty well? Lee off the bar late Brock’s breakaway…were you rooting for them to lose so you could whine more? What a sad little boy you must be.
newyorkislanders,lxjwdar,2024-11-17 00:31:46,How so?  Are you suggesting we’re actually quite good and just had a bad game? I see you’re an optimist and you prefer “an elite goalie carrying a mid team” over a rebuild so clearly you realize this team isn’t very good. So are you suggesting we didn’t get “reffed”?
newyorkislanders,lxilsx9,2024-11-16 19:14:11,They made some weak calls to give the Kraken those PPs anyways why not make another lol
newyorkislanders,lxjsxbu,2024-11-17 00:03:11,back to nonsense hate again i see myke. he was exactly where he needed to be. the deflection and interference is what caused the goal.
newyorkislanders,lxila5z,2024-11-16 19:11:01,If only he had a coach with some experience netminding to teach him.
newyorkislanders,lxl3bja,2024-11-17 07:48:24,I agree that they got reffed. I’m just a realistic sports fan that actually roots for their team to win games. Making the playoffs doesn’t make you a “not very good” or “not any good” hockey team. If all the teams that aren’t top flight contenders tried to rebuild immediately this league would suck to watch.It’s not “optimistic” to prefer playoff hockey over a lottery team with no cap space. What is delusional and “optimistic” is thinking this roster could rebuild effectively any time soon and that we should rush into it while Ilya ages.
newyorkislanders,lxjyk2z,2024-11-17 00:49:28,They did not get reffed but yeah the team unfortunately sucks. They can't close out games to save their lives.
newyorkislanders,lxjyls6,2024-11-17 00:49:51,That’s not nonsense hate. Your just being a moron. That contact did not stop him from making that save hence why it wasn’t interference. Him pushing to far from the center of the goal is what screwed him and if his positioning was correct he would have been in position for that tip. You need to learn what a positional save is. Sorokin knows he messed up on that goal. Also btw sorokin has been fantastic this year he’s back to his old self. So instead of thinking I hate him for some reason listen to what I actually say.
newyorkislanders,lxj175l,2024-11-16 20:50:13,Man mistakes happen in hockey. That’s a game tho isles win more often then not. Seattle got every bounce
newyorkislanders,lxkbndp,2024-11-17 02:55:04,Agreed. I was at the game and replay after replay at the arena slowed no interference. As for the challenge I guess what else is he going to do in that situation. It was clear the team was done at making attempts to score or even shooting the puck. So a comeback at full strength was out of the question. Oh and BTE first time at Climate Pledge. Beautiful arena.
newyorkislanders,lxk6s73,2024-11-17 02:04:07,> Your just being a moron.i have no dog in this fight but that’s a tough look
newyorkislanders,lxo8j5y,2024-11-17 18:42:08,This is a game the Islanders lose more often than not.
newyorkislanders,lxlxd1v,2024-11-17 11:07:14,This guy has insulted me all of last year when I was critical of sorokin poor play. Idc
newyorkislanders,lxoblhf,2024-11-17 19:00:02,Not really Seattles goals were lucky at best and honestly most of the time you simply just don’t score those type of goals.
newyorkislanders,lxm1r5w,2024-11-17 11:31:27,are you the guy that said Sorokin was only an average goalie? because in that case you deserved it
newyorkislanders,lxp5po8,2024-11-17 22:02:14,It seems to happen an awful lot against the Islanders. They only have 4 regulation wins lmao.Colorado Buffalo Ottawa VancouverNot exactly good. I wish I had the stats but I believe the Islanders blew 5 leads in the third period for a loss in regulation or OT. This team is not good. The numbers do not lie.
newyorkislanders,lxm32do,2024-11-17 11:38:41,No that wasn’t me. I never called sorokin average. I see sorokin as a top 5 goalie in this league but I was very critical of him last year because he wasn’t himself. His positioning rebound control and his knack for missing muffins were an issue last year. He was flat out bad and not only the eye test but stats backed that up as well. This year tho he seems so much calmer and is back to his normal self
newyorkislanders,lxp96s5,2024-11-17 22:24:50,1. Blew a 1 goal lead against Montreal with 5 minutes to play in the third period2. Blew a 3 - 2 lead against the Devils in the last minute and a half of the third period3. Blew a 3 - 1 lead against the Devils with 8 minutes to play in the third period . Lost in OT 4. Blew a 2 - 1 lead to Seattle with 15 minutes to play in the third period and gave up the winning goal with 3 minutes to play in the third period. These are only leads blown in the third period.Already 4 in 18 Games
newyorkislanders,lxi4a23,2024-11-16 17:27:06,Bring your green hat
newyorkislanders,lxl0fid,2024-11-17 07:22:48,Watching a player hit a hot streak is one of the best feelings as a fan
newyorkislanders,lxonrr3,2024-11-17 20:11:18,I’m here for it

newyorkislanders,lxiev00,2024-11-16 18:31:13,Goalie interference is the most inconsistent call in the league. I don’t think this will go our way but who knows
newyorkislanders,lxig0h6,2024-11-16 18:38:31,Refs with a blinder late. Dickheads.

newyorkislanders,lxig3x0,2024-11-16 18:39:06,You just can’t make that mistake if you’re Mayfield to give up the game tying goal 40 seconds after taking the lead. 
newyorkislanders,lxfmwgy,2024-11-16 09:11:58,Holy crap game Batman. But yeah an afternoon West Coast game seems dangerous.

newyorkislanders,lxibjzw,2024-11-16 18:10:32,What was Mayfield thinking?
newyorkislanders,lxicbto,2024-11-16 18:15:23,Bardreau's first (and only) NHL goal is also one of my favorite first NHL goals. I was there for it.
newyorkislanders,lxicg0j,2024-11-16 18:16:06,tsyplakov with the drop to nelson then gives him a lane by taking seattle sticks out of the play is a small thing that prob doesn’t get noticed too much but damn that’s a sneaky good play
newyorkislanders,lxifg13,2024-11-16 18:34:57,so what we’re saying here is youre allowed contact with the goalie in the crease at the same time of a shot on net. wouldve been soft but theres a serious precedent u make with that call
newyorkislanders,lxifnqm,2024-11-16 18:36:18,What a joke of a no ice

newyorkislanders,lxi5spg,2024-11-16 17:35:55,How many 3 on 1's or 3 on 2's have the Isles done absolutely nothing  with
newyorkislanders,lxiasjb,2024-11-16 18:05:47,Check the Calendar...ITS BROCKTOBER
newyorkislanders,lxif39i,2024-11-16 18:32:40,I think that’s the right call but if we did that it for sure comes back
newyorkislanders,lxif6bg,2024-11-16 18:33:13,That is going to count IMO but I do believe that is interference. Pretty clear Sorokin was trying to centre in his net and wasn’t able to. Does it affect the goal? Debatable.
newyorkislanders,lxhm9r7,2024-11-16 15:47:45,Fishermen hunt kraken
newyorkislanders,lxhpprz,2024-11-16 16:06:27,I don't think I like a 4:00 start
newyorkislanders,lxhsp44,2024-11-16 16:22:46,That’s just bad luck. Shot was missing the net if it didn’t go off Gourde.
newyorkislanders,lxht4u8,2024-11-16 16:25:09,Just once I'd love for one of these nice-looking plays to turn into a goal.
newyorkislanders,lxhu6vg,2024-11-16 16:30:55,They refuse to score great opportunities lol
newyorkislanders,lxhucku,2024-11-16 16:31:48,Slick skillful pass by George.

newyorkislanders,lxhvijo,2024-11-16 16:38:10,Engvall's come back is exciting. he really evolved his play since coming back.
newyorkislanders,lxhwx99,2024-11-16 16:46:01,Not sure why I thought of this just today but does anyone know exactly what lou’s number rules are? I always figured under 30 but George and others are wearing numbers in the 30s so is it 40?
newyorkislanders,lxhy2ie,2024-11-16 16:52:20,What do the Isles play in the OZ is it 2-1-2?
newyorkislanders,lxi10yh,2024-11-16 17:08:40,ayo wtf was that curious george pic

newyorkislanders,lxi4ah9,2024-11-16 17:27:10,Fuck that call

newyorkislanders,lxiahik,2024-11-16 18:03:51,i think that was a weak call
newyorkislanders,lxiaq0w,2024-11-16 18:05:20,These penalties make the nhl look weak
newyorkislanders,lxib43h,2024-11-16 18:07:47,I know it was incidental but why cant we call that interference
newyorkislanders,lxib6th,2024-11-16 18:08:14,I hope Cizikas is alright

newyorkislanders,lxiet4m,2024-11-16 18:30:53,That's not goalie interference
newyorkislanders,lxievq7,2024-11-16 18:31:21,So cool that I couldn’t tell you how they will rule on this
newyorkislanders,lxif2c9,2024-11-16 18:32:31,Wasn't a fan of that challenge
newyorkislanders,lxif79u,2024-11-16 18:33:23,I've seen goals called back for less but who knows. They honestly should just get rid of the rule because nobody seems to understand it.
newyorkislanders,lxifh7j,2024-11-16 18:35:09,Put that in fuckkk
newyorkislanders,lxg0gur,2024-11-16 10:35:46,LGI. We're so back.
newyorkislanders,lxhddbz,2024-11-16 14:58:59,A W today ensures the Isles go at least .500 on this road trip which is the bar of what a good team should be able to clear away from home.Though interestingly enough the Isles are 2-3-2 at home and 5-3-2 on the road this season so far.
newyorkislanders,lxhqba4,2024-11-16 16:09:43,Day games on the West Coast. Let us pray.
newyorkislanders,lxhs5mc,2024-11-16 16:19:48,Damn that was a phenomenal pass by tsyplakov on the 2 on 1
newyorkislanders,lxhsgob,2024-11-16 16:21:29,Yep all those chances not cashed in gonna probably be the story of the game
newyorkislanders,lxhsi7p,2024-11-16 16:21:43,Jeez come on.
newyorkislanders,lxhsitc,2024-11-16 16:21:48,unlucky
newyorkislanders,lxhsyq1,2024-11-16 16:24:13,If the 21 14 44 line keeps this up they’re going to score at *some point* today
newyorkislanders,lxhv7jw,2024-11-16 16:36:30,Engvall going to the net will keep him in the big club! Love to see him working on being more physical and going to the dirty areas
newyorkislanders,lxhw2qt,2024-11-16 16:41:17,Is that Hickey we hear talking in the background?
newyorkislanders,lxhwzy3,2024-11-16 16:46:26,Kraken started to figure it out there at the end of the period. Islanders should definitely be winning this game tho a lot of missed opportunities.
newyorkislanders,lxi0uic,2024-11-16 17:07:40,Mayfield that was terrifying
newyorkislanders,lxi1om4,2024-11-16 17:12:21,George is a fucking beast
newyorkislanders,lxi1rv7,2024-11-16 17:12:51,Sorokin mi amor...

newyorkislanders,lxi5f5w,2024-11-16 17:33:42,Great positioning from George on that 3-on-1
newyorkislanders,lxi6f70,2024-11-16 17:39:32,I think I finally found a team that's slower than the Isles on D
newyorkislanders,lxiar1m,2024-11-16 18:05:31,BIG COCK BROCK NELSON
newyorkislanders,lxiar64,2024-11-16 18:05:32,NELLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
newyorkislanders,lxib4dv,2024-11-16 18:07:50,I know that’s unintentional but it’s still interference.
newyorkislanders,lxibip5,2024-11-16 18:10:19,You can’t make this shit up
newyorkislanders,lxibntd,2024-11-16 18:11:12,Ok we got Mayfield's mandatory airhead moment with 15 minutes to go instead of with 1 minute left. Hopefully the rest of the game goes well.
newyorkislanders,lxic1p6,2024-11-16 18:13:38,Mayfield is so bad

newyorkislanders,lxif0wi,2024-11-16 18:32:16,That’s not GI and Ik it was tipped but sorokin slid so far from the middle of the goal there.
newyorkislanders,lxif7iu,2024-11-16 18:33:26,Why don't the Islanders simply score another shorthanded goal?
newyorkislanders,lxifgli,2024-11-16 18:35:03,So much pain

newyorkislanders,lxgz0pl,2024-11-16 13:42:03,I'll be watching Nebraska unless it goes south quickly usually Isles score when I'm not watching so I'm expecting a 12-2 game.
newyorkislanders,lxhgfi1,2024-11-16 15:15:51,Anyone know a good spot to catch the game in Manhattan? preferably one that isn’t strictly 21+ idk if i trust my fake right now lol

newyorkislanders,lxibodp,2024-11-16 18:11:18,i always say tips bounces and break aways are things i cant fault the goalie for. sadly both goals fall under that. gotta tighten up and we can win this in regulation

newyorkislanders,lxhxo9w,2024-11-16 16:50:11,I haven’t seen a whole lot different from him. He always had stretches where he looked like he was about to break out as a superstar. He’s on one right now and I hope it continues but I still don’t see any more physical play or any more than he had on his hot streaks in the past. I hope I’m wrong and this is something more permanent but he still needs to prove it for me.
newyorkislanders,lxhya10,2024-11-16 16:53:29,40 remember Mayfield used to wear 42 and had to change. They also changed Johnston from 52 to 32.

newyorkislanders,lxgcx13,2024-11-16 11:44:17,Just look at what’s happened to our jerseys. You know we never used to have ads on our jerseys. We had these beautiful blue and orange jerseys with no ads - and they said Loser Lou would never allow ads on the jerseys but now you look and there’s ads on the jerseys. There’s ads on the helmets. It’s sad what’s happening to our jerseys under the current President (of Hockey Operations).
newyorkislanders,lxdjnnp,2024-11-15 22:09:40,They're heat pressed on they come off easily if you'd like
newyorkislanders,lxdhqv1,2024-11-15 21:57:01,I'm personally selling them
newyorkislanders,lxdc31c,2024-11-15 21:18:57,Many years ago I wrote Stan asking for an autograph. He sent me back a signed letter his business card and his personal phone number. He said if I ever wanted to talk hockey I could give him a call. I was just a shy teen so I never took him up on it but it was a very nice gesture.
newyorkislanders,lxddl3l,2024-11-15 21:28:52,So I used to have a press pass for the Isles when I was WAY more involved with writing and then my podcast. Doing interviews literally right next to Stan in his prime - was something to behold. I’m glad I got that experience. The respect this man got from players around the league was beautiful. One night against Boston I was coming out of the Isles room and Chara stopped me to ask if I knew where Stan was. He was still in the room conducting an interview for postgame stuff on MSG. I WENT UP BEHIND and whispered in his free ear that Chara was waiting for him quietly while he worked. He grabbed my arm to make me stay as he finished his interview and when he did thanked me profusely for the way I alerted him. Was one of those moments for me. Chara also gave me a few minutes of facetime also which was great. Towards the end of my time around the team Stan had moved into more of a part time thing and I rarely got to see him. But a few years ago the Isles did a huge thing for his birthday and I got to sign his jersey and talk to him. He remembered my name. He truly is a great man and extremely talented. We were absolutely blessed here in NY during his heyday!
newyorkislanders,lxdcihj,2024-11-15 21:21:46,I almost distracted him from going back on air because we were talking about trains
newyorkislanders,lxddpui,2024-11-15 21:29:45,He’s since moved to Israel and lives there with at least one of his kids and grand children. That’s why he’s not around MSG or NY. I grew up watching up truly The Maven.
newyorkislanders,lxdeeih,2024-11-15 21:34:22,I met Stan once in the garden of St. John the Divine while I was working on the renovations in the late 2000s.  He was with his son and I think they were working on one of his books.   I walked up and said “Maven?” and he looked up with this huge smile.  I told him how much a loved his book ***Cracked Ice*** for which he thanked me and we talked hockey in general for a solid 15-20 minutes.  I can tell you I don’t think he was a fan of Jamie Langenbrunner (who had just taken the Devils’ captaincy from Patrik Elias) and didn’t hold back on any criticisms of Milbury/Snow/Wang.  He also asked me if I ever read ***The Game*** by Ken Dryden and I said no I hadn’t but I wanted to and that it was just a big time commitment. He said (and I’m paraphrasing) “It’s like reading an encyclopedia.  It’s dry and humorless…just like Ken Dryden.”Stan is a legend.
newyorkislanders,lxdbflx,2024-11-15 21:14:39,I'll go first: My dad and I met him about ten years ago at an Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side. My dad's a big train fan in addition to being an Isles fan and we hardly spoke about hockey (or anything else for that matter Stan's quite talkative). He also went on at length about his love for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Hell of a storyteller really down-to-earth everything you'd expect he'd be. Still sad he moved to Israel -- you can take the man out of Brooklyn but you can't take Brooklyn out of the man.
newyorkislanders,lxdgaar,2024-11-15 21:47:12,When I was about 8/9 years old in the late 90s my dad and I ran into Stan on the Coliseum concourse after a game. While making some quick small talk my dad realized he forgot something at the seats. Stan insisted that I stay with him while my dad ran to the seats and back. So I guess Stan technically babysat me for about ten minutes once.
newyorkislanders,lxdlmbg,2024-11-15 22:22:29,"Not so much a story.  But I used to love ""the cheers and jeers.  The yays and boos"""
newyorkislanders,lxdm8qj,2024-11-15 22:26:30,One time I sat in the same car as him on a subway ride back from the Barclay's Center after a game. He looked pretty tired so I didn't bother him. Crazy story I know.
newyorkislanders,lxddoa5,2024-11-15 21:29:27,I met him in the basement of the coliseum before a game. He was working at one of the picnic tables behind the fencing. I felt bad interrupting him but wanted to thank him for the Nabokov post game interviews that he was doing. I told him they were very entertaining.
newyorkislanders,lxdwcz2,2024-11-15 23:36:49,These are amazing stories thanks for sharing!
newyorkislanders,lxf8b46,2024-11-16 07:23:53,I love hearing stuff like that! Stan’s always had this respect from both players and fans it’s like he’s part of the fabric of hockey culture.
newyorkislanders,lxgkws5,2024-11-16 12:27:22,I used to work for the Devils and we were filming a sketch for something. I was on camera as the interviewer and had to get a quick three-word reply from Stan. I really don’t remember the specifics but he went on this 10-minute soliloquy about everything and afterwards I asked the video guy how we were supposed to cut it. He came back with the edit where I ask the Stan the question he begins to answer and the video fast forwards for ages until it finally reaches the end when Stan circles back to actually answering. It wound up being kinda funny. And now I wish I had it saved somewhere.
newyorkislanders,lxds7wk,2024-11-15 23:07:12,not any cool ones but have shaken his hand a couple times at the Coliseum don’t think i ever ran into him at Barclays or UBS
newyorkislanders,lxdueo4,2024-11-15 23:22:58,I don’t have a story about Stan. But if I remember correctly I think he had a job in hockey from the 30’s as a little kid selling programs at the garden to the 2020s as a broadcast. That is insane!
newyorkislanders,lxg8bnx,2024-11-16 11:19:17,Stan should be in the Islanders hall of fame.
newyorkislanders,lxdekjl,2024-11-15 21:35:31,Yeah I’m sad he moved to Israel. He’s active on Twitter. I sort of wish someone would write a book about him.He and my uncle were young reporters in the 1950s. They knew each other. One thing I remember well is his when his son Simon had open heart surgery. Simon and I are right around the same age. I ran into Stan a few times at the coliseum never really had time to talk to him but when I got a hello in I always asked about Simon.
newyorkislanders,lxirdm4,2024-11-16 19:48:30,Stan is like my grandpas age—93 still going strong—and I always liked seeing him around. He still alive right?
newyorkislanders,lxhrthm,2024-11-16 16:17:58,Never liked the guy. He never had anything good to say about the team in the mid 90’s and was always the hugest Devils and Rangers cheerleaders. Then in the early 2000’s when the isles had a decent team he’d come back and sing our praises only to become a hater the next year. Only think I enjoyed of his is his book Metro Ice. It’s a very good book about the history of hockey in the tri-state area
newyorkislanders,lxdiuhm,2024-11-15 22:04:19,Really cool stories thank you for sharing
newyorkislanders,lxdi9t1,2024-11-15 22:00:30,He’s absolutely right about The Game. Touted as  the greatest hockey book ever but I bet no one has ever finished it.
newyorkislanders,lxdqlsi,2024-11-15 22:55:38,That’s what I was going to say. His chemistry with Nabokov was off the charts!! Those interviews were priceless!
newyorkislanders,lxdrytr,2024-11-15 23:05:21,now i’m taking this as a challenge
newyorkislanders,lxl6k60,2024-11-17 08:14:14,Ha that’s very true. I listened to it on audio book and while it was indeed interesting I just didn’t finish it. He read it and was quite dry but at the same time it wasn’t. ¯\_()_/¯
newyorkislanders,lxh49yk,2024-11-16 14:10:06,As opposed to his chemistry with Roy.  I’m pretty sure they hated each other for real.
newyorkislanders,lxbtudl,2024-11-15 16:01:05,Also a maintenance day for Pageau. To quote Roy sometimes a Ferrari has to go to the garage.
newyorkislanders,lxchy8b,2024-11-15 18:10:28,I like the way our Russian kids bury Hughes brothers can’t wait to have Rom back!

newyorkislanders,lxa8q4k,2024-11-15 11:15:19,Need the team account to get up and running on bsky
newyorkislanders,lxan37v,2024-11-15 12:26:09,For who are unfamiliar with Bluesky it is essentially Twitter 2.0It was started internally at Twitter to basically replace the underlying tech it was built on with a more modern and robust system. One of the major hurdles for the project was to transition from the original system to the new one without making people create all new accounts/download a new app. When Musk bought Twitter the Bluesky project was not included in the sale. Now free of needing to be backwards compatible with Twitter It was launched as a stand alone app. If you’re happy with how Twitter has changed over the last year or two Bluesky may not be attractive to you. If you dislike the Twitter changes you should check Bluesky out.

wildhockey,lxtxtu5,2024-11-18 17:28:19,Every game is sold out usually
wildhockey,lxty18g,2024-11-18 17:29:24,Games like this typically don't get too cheap even last minute tickets. It's a holiday and playing Chicago.And yes going to be packed to the gills. Bars will be crazy drunk people. Will be a blast tho!
wildhockey,lxtz2vp,2024-11-18 17:35:02,The early start means there will be more children there because the game doesn't end past their bedtime.In the past that game has been against Winnipeg and their fans always travelled well. Chicago is one of those teams that seems to have a fans everywhere. With the city being relatively close by geographically and the holiday weekend their fans will probably travel well too.That said I think it is just as likely somebody with tickets in hand suddenly has a conflict in plans because of the holiday.
wildhockey,lxtzrhq,2024-11-18 17:38:43,Matinee vs Blackhawks on a day that most people have off work.We used to go to the Black Friday game a lot and even vs teams that weren’t close geographic rivals; it’s been packed.
wildhockey,lxu17st,2024-11-18 17:46:32,I mean it’s the hottest ticket in town that day unless there’s a giant concert in Minneapolis that night
wildhockey,lxu2whs,2024-11-18 17:55:49,Ticket prices are already higher for that game than most of the other games in the next few weeks I wouldn’t expect much of a drop of any at all.
wildhockey,lxu1jtd,2024-11-18 17:48:23,Moreso
wildhockey,lxu3as6,2024-11-18 17:58:00,https://preview.redd.it/0mxhsbz1qq1e1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3674daad060c81a4070e01ba770ec0b95f32a02aThey come but they don't always have fun.

wildhockey,lxtwtwa,2024-11-18 17:22:58,Brilliant!
wildhockey,lxu6lld,2024-11-18 18:16:54,I LOVE GEQBUS!
wildhockey,lxsrx7j,2024-11-18 13:55:18,KEEBler boys back together!That line is almost guaranteed to get 2 points every night.  As long as those other 3 lines can keep it together defensively we should be fine.  Same shit as last year.
wildhockey,lxsusi4,2024-11-18 14:09:39,Glad to see Ek and Brodin back. Reuniting that top line should be fun. Interested to see if Rossi can carry his own line or drive play and get something out of Mojo. Hartzy also needs to step up and provide some offense too
wildhockey,lxsrea2,2024-11-18 13:52:41,are they sending Milne and Ohgren back down?
wildhockey,lxtcsg8,2024-11-18 15:40:54,Just imagine a team where they don’t have Johansson weighing down the top 6.That extra cap space next year is gonna buy us a nice upgrade there.
wildhockey,lxtp3p4,2024-11-18 16:42:51,Yay!! So happy to see Ek and Brodin will be back!!!!
wildhockey,lxtgqji,2024-11-18 16:00:38,Out of curiosity did they ever say what Ek and Brodin were dealing with or was it just “lower body”?I’m still on the JoJo Isn’t Great bench. But he hasn’t been gut-wrenching awful and I mean who else can we put in his place who is ready to be out of Iowa permanently right now? I’m still excited to see how tomorrow goes and have been having a really good time watching the team this season so I can’t really complain.
wildhockey,lxu0jr3,2024-11-18 17:42:55,Honestly I think that Merrill needs to be the odd man out in the bottom pairing. Chisholm/Bogo both have shown offensive flashes and playmaking while not having the defensive lapses that Merrill frequently has. Other than that looking forward to seeing what this group can do tomorrow.
wildhockey,lxssk24,2024-11-18 13:58:25,Gotta keep Johansson in the top 6 so he can continue doing nothing 
wildhockey,lxu7exn,2024-11-18 18:21:36,Well if Rossi isn't going to be on the top line this setup is probably the next best thing.
wildhockey,lxu304k,2024-11-18 17:56:22,I think Ek and Brodin are 2 of the most underrated players in the league.
wildhockey,lxssj0b,2024-11-18 13:58:16,Hunt Ohgren and Milne were sent down yesterday.
wildhockey,lxssfag,2024-11-18 13:57:46,They already were two new guys were called up.
wildhockey,lxty4sv,2024-11-18 17:29:56,Ek tweaked his leg not sure for Brodin. Upper body iirc
wildhockey,lxst6ys,2024-11-18 14:01:37,Who is the replacement? Ohgren didn't look the part. JoJo won't be good in a bottom 6 role. Bitching is easy. What's the plan you armchair gm?
wildhockey,lxt067m,2024-11-18 14:36:39,Can't move him to the bottom 6. He's not that kind of player. Gonna have to deal with it till he's gone.
wildhockey,lxu3ulm,2024-11-18 18:01:07,I agree with you 100%. Quietly 2 of the most important pieces for the Wild ever
wildhockey,lxsufp8,2024-11-18 14:07:53,Thanks. I had looked at the Wild site and I didn't see that.
wildhockey,lxtxp3e,2024-11-18 17:27:36,Try before you buy. Love it. These younger players deserve a chance to be seen.
wildhockey,lxswbkv,2024-11-18 14:17:17,Said this before: Mojo isn't even earning his $2M but the only place he can play is 2nd line and hope he does little damage. If Wild had anyone that would be an improvement there they would try it but he can't play lower like you said.
wildhockey,lxtabz7,2024-11-18 15:28:25,Send him to the AHL. His replacement might not be ready today but could one of the young guys develop into a more complete player than Johansson is in the top 6 in some amount of time? The same reason he stinks on the third or 4th line is the same reason we all want him off the top 6. He has zero grit he's afraid of the center of the ice/contact. He's fast but not fast enough to do nothing waiting around for opportunities to carry the puck with no danger of contact.The same arguments were made for V1ctor and the dude was out of the league as soon as that contract expired. Did Rask suddenly become inferior to all those prospects he was taking potential development time from? Like playoffs were over the wild didn't even offer him a vet minimum deal Neither did any other NHL team.... but there wasn't anyone who could have developed into a better player than him with a bit of experience?Waive him and move on.
wildhockey,lxsz9zp,2024-11-18 14:32:06,I'd rather see Gaudreau Lauko Khustnutdinov or Foligno up there. Bury Jojo on the 4th line and give him 7 minutes. He can try to earn his spot back in the same role that everyone else who supposedly has had a shot to earn it gets.
wildhockey,lxsv6t1,2024-11-18 14:11:38,I think it’s the frustration of most of the fan base. No need to get aggressive. Unfortunately you are right that there’s nowhere else Mojo can be slotted in other than the press box but there’s no one better to take that spot. When the team is healthy I’d honestly rather 11-7 and have a forward double shift in place of mojo. All he offers is zone entries
wildhockey,lxt4o9l,2024-11-18 14:59:23,A Taylor Hall at the deadline could be interesting. Both Brocks are often rumored but those feel like off-season moves.
wildhockey,lxtihd5,2024-11-18 16:09:27,"Reading between the lines here I'm seeing ""get worse now in hopes of getting better later"" which isn't an option. We've got a great record in spite of JoJo and making the playoffs is a must."
wildhockey,lxt5ypy,2024-11-18 15:05:59,Seems like he hasn't been good for a while at $6M. Probably not a good idea. Healthy scratch by Blackhawks?
wildhockey,lxtnwp7,2024-11-18 16:36:46,Known vs unkown quantity... We know Johansson isn't going to significantly contribute now or later in the season. We don't know if a younger player with a higher ceiling would end up better and that seems like the gamble I wish we would take. Did V1ctor Rask contribute to us making the playoffs? We could have possibly built up a younger player who would be contributing at that point and possibly help win games along the way.
wildhockey,lxt67np,2024-11-18 15:07:16,Some Chicago fans say he's been not good but not bad on an awful team. Figured he could be a cheap option.
wildhockey,lxtp2bq,2024-11-18 16:42:39,Johansson has been fine defensively which is rarely the case with younger guys. I'm not thrilled with him either but there aren't many/any better options right now.
wildhockey,lxtb3qr,2024-11-18 15:32:20,Won his MVP playing for Hynes. Just chucking that out there.
wildhockey,lxtjcgk,2024-11-18 16:13:45,Is $6M cheap?
wildhockey,lxtjomi,2024-11-18 16:15:26,We're projected to have 10M at the deadline but specifically I was referring to assets we'd need to trade to get him. A healthy scratch isn't worth a 3rd or 4th rounder.
wildhockey,lxtlez2,2024-11-18 16:24:08,A deadline deal might not be bad. He tends to play well when arriving on a new team and he's in the last year of his contract so not much of a financial outlay at that point of the season. Chicago might take one of the D prospects in Iowa.
wildhockey,lxu20y8,2024-11-18 17:50:58,That's a deal I'd probably make. A 4th rounder for a rental who has a history with Hynes. That's pretty low risk. Though still not thrilled about giving up futures for this year's squad.
wildhockey,lxrp7vf,2024-11-18 10:38:04,Good stats are good. We gotta avoid losing to every central division opponent this year though.
wildhockey,lxs7ldo,2024-11-18 12:13:28,Gus bus also in a 3 way tie for 1st place in save %. Kind of funny one of the other 3 is Talbot who he is also tied with at 1 shutout so looks like the trade worked out nicely for both sides. Ottawa has to be happy. /s
wildhockey,lxs8rxb,2024-11-18 12:19:25,"Nope ya ain't getting me with that ""hope"" shit. Until the boys make it through January looking good I'm staying in the skeptical train."
wildhockey,lxrrx15,2024-11-18 10:52:28,Jets and Stars are still damn good teams. Although our recent showing with injuries was much more inspiring than last year's games.
wildhockey,lxs3pwm,2024-11-18 11:53:44,Totally with you. Even if we finish .500 this year against our division that would be a huge improvement. I believe we are 1-1-1 right now. Hopefully we can pummel St. Louis!
wildhockey,lxrr038,2024-11-18 10:47:37,I’m crying inside.
wildhockey,lxs95qx,2024-11-18 12:21:22,Okay
wildhockey,lxrsrd1,2024-11-18 10:56:57,All things considered can't be too upset over the loss to Dallas with 3 of our big guns out
wildhockey,lxsd57i,2024-11-18 12:41:17,1-1-2 we lost to the hawks in OT
wildhockey,lxsh2e2,2024-11-18 13:00:47,Oh yes forgot about that. I mean we are already in better shape than last year lol
wildhockey,lxrwugj,2024-11-18 11:18:34,Let’s go boys! Forget about Dallas.
wildhockey,lxs3cyj,2024-11-18 11:51:55,I think it was a good call to let Ohgie and Milne go back to Iowa and play and have Shore and Jones with the team. The kids need to play and develop. I expect Ohgie to have a great season in Iowa and be ready next year
wildhockey,lxsqdsf,2024-11-18 13:47:42,OHGIE OHGLETHORPE?!?
wildhockey,lxu61l7,2024-11-18 18:13:40,He was deported to Canada.
wildhockey,lxu6vv4,2024-11-18 18:18:33,They refused to take him back!
wildhockey,lxu7e56,2024-11-18 18:21:29,What trying rookie year for that young man
wildhockey,lxr66ik,2024-11-18 08:44:34,So Gus is leading the league in SV%?
wildhockey,lxs006t,2024-11-18 11:34:56,Yay for Gus !!
wildhockey,lxrwexi,2024-11-18 11:16:16,Ha! I didn't know the Peggers got whooped. I don't really hate the Jets like I used to but it would be fun to have another rivalry with them. A clean one. Not a bunch of cheap crap and chippy games. We seem to be quite disciplined under Hynes. Go Wild!
wildhockey,lxscizq,2024-11-18 12:38:13,"Gus saying ""howdy boys"" to the whole league now"
wildhockey,lxr80na,2024-11-18 08:56:30,He's leading in GAA and 0.054% below 1st in SV% (3rd overall).
wildhockey,lxp1jrn,2024-11-17 21:36:14,Russos article yesterday mentioned he’s still in the hospital.  Sure sounds like a ruptured teste poor guy. Wishing him the best.
wildhockey,lxoqcx7,2024-11-17 20:27:06,He will not be coming all over the ice
wildhockey,lxoopeb,2024-11-17 20:16:59,He had emergency surgery the night of the accident and is place on the IR for 3-4 weeks. Other than that there hasn’t been more news that I am aware of
wildhockey,lxopq8f,2024-11-17 20:23:14,Probably done having kids
wildhockey,lxoqrnx,2024-11-17 20:29:37,Ootl it sounds like a LBI of very specific nature?
wildhockey,lxpaite,2024-11-17 22:33:42,I sincerely hope he still has one functioning testicle
wildhockey,lxpzc3r,2024-11-18 01:53:43,He's in a lot of pain. I remember mitch garver had that happen too
wildhockey,lxpcqgu,2024-11-17 22:48:42,Even with one ball men can still reproduce

wildhockey,lxr0rgm,2024-11-18 08:07:40,Let’s hope so! Phil the great kessel managed to dominate the league with only 1 nut so as long as he’s got one he should be ok

wildhockey,lxormx3,2024-11-17 20:34:57,Give your balls a tug and sticks for everyone! I imagine we are accruing cap space with Zucc out?
wildhockey,lxoe8aj,2024-11-17 19:15:17,Excited for Jones. Would like to see what he can bring for a few games.
wildhockey,lxojk4q,2024-11-17 19:45:52,Jones was one of the best players in the preseason.  I hope he still has that kind of fire.There's going to be a tinkering process with Zuccarello out for so long.  I'm cool with given people with NHL experience runs up here to get some lines gelling properly.
wildhockey,lxoe21c,2024-11-17 19:14:15,Love it. Let’s find out what these guys have. I’m fine with this whole season being a litmus test.
wildhockey,lxosi4i,2024-11-17 20:40:17,**NER NERRRRRRRR!!!!!!**

wildhockey,lxrij5u,2024-11-18 10:00:46,So they can not play?
wildhockey,lxrltis,2024-11-18 10:19:27,Elite goal scorer Ben Jones
wildhockey,lxomi5j,2024-11-17 20:03:32,Get fuckin Reilly up here too!

wildhockey,lxmgc6e,2024-11-17 12:52:10,Just gotta keep trucking.  One loss to Dallas ends up moot if the Wild keep St. Louis at bay next week.
wildhockey,lxlnc1n,2024-11-17 10:09:01,i feel like he's being asked to do too much. I think he sees more time than those other guys due to being one of our best at zone entries and initiating offensive opportunities from the side walls.
wildhockey,lxlkido,2024-11-17 09:51:46,Johansson reminds me of every kid on my youth hockey teams that had tremendous skill with a stick but coasted around aimlessly when they didn't have the puck.
wildhockey,lxma60n,2024-11-17 12:17:57,Sports fans really love taking out their frustration on one player.
wildhockey,lxlw8pp,2024-11-17 11:00:57,Its the fact they trust him over Rossi in the clutch too. Rossi has an elite shot and very great in tight hands. The fact he wasn't out there with like a minute left is brutal. I like Hynes and how he instead afraid to switch things up. Like the Chicago game. But his blind loyalty  to Jojo makes no sense. Its giving Dean Evason when he gave Gaudreau top 6 minutes.
wildhockey,lxm8sxl,2024-11-17 12:10:17,I have only 2 theories as to why they're giving MoJo this many opportunities:They are trying to force his trade value to be higher than it is/do him a solid to try for another contract this summer in free agencyorHe has blackmail on the staff
wildhockey,lxmkpyj,2024-11-17 13:16:00,I forget that Jojo is out there.
wildhockey,lxu7vq3,2024-11-18 18:24:18,OR… Rossi had just been hurt which looked pretty painful and they probably thought they should not throw him out there. I know he came back and played some but still just being safe maybe. As far as being too tough on Rossi he has a ceiling that is higher than he is showing. Somehow they have to bring it out. Rookies get different treatment to bring the best out of them. They are talking about it trying things good cop bad cop who the hell knows. Mojo is what he is and nobody is scheming to get him more ice time for whatever reason.
wildhockey,lxmdfli,2024-11-17 12:36:04,He is who he is. He’s a better option right now than Ohgren who to me looks like a faster skating version of Adam Beckman and not much more.
wildhockey,lxm8zvz,2024-11-17 12:11:23,He's in no man's land of not quite offensively gifted enough for 2nd line permanence and not physical/defensive enough to be on our 3rd line.
wildhockey,lxmvkko,2024-11-17 14:12:33,Hard agree he’s being tasked with too much. I can *understand* why Hynes wants him with Boldy in theory. Boldy needs to play with a winger that has speed can enter the zone clean and facilitate. Problem is he’s not good enough after he gains the line but other than Lauko I don’t think there’s anybody with more speed. Would Lauko look better there? It’s worth a shot IMO. Let’s face it he’s gone after this season and possibly at the trade deadline. He’s taken over as the whipping boy from Freddy (who’s looked great this year BTW) but there’s no one in Iowa at this time that can usurp his spot in the lineup.
wildhockey,lxm8ni1,2024-11-17 12:09:28,Dude hardly ever initiates anything except turnovers.
wildhockey,lxn4qbt,2024-11-17 15:02:04,Hes statistically one of the worst top 6 forwards in the league and likely the worst on the team
wildhockey,lxmlfcv,2024-11-17 13:19:45,I don't know why it seems like Rossi is in the dog house. He's done great centering with Kap.
wildhockey,lxm5d25,2024-11-17 11:51:16,Evason is how we got Johansson...twice. I mean I guess Guerin listening to him had something (everything?) to do with it.The first time was BAD. Then we got him again and had a magical two month run and have been paying for it ever since.
wildhockey,lxmlxc8,2024-11-17 13:22:26,It's simple. Guerin likes Mojo over Rossi.We've seen it over and over the players that Guerin prefers and wants to see on the ice *soooooooomehow* always get more minutes than anyone else always get pushed out in crunch time despite there being better players. And for some reason I can't reply to /u/PaxDragoon but this sub needs to stop blaming Evason (who isn't even here anymore guys) for Guerin's decisions. We see it time and time again. When Fleury got here immediately Fleury took over as starter despite posting worse stats. When there were no takers on a Rask trade he immediately fell off the first line and never sniffed it again. And who do we hear our GM constantly talking about trading off constantly talking about needing to improve? Rossi who lo and behold gets demoted constantly and his minutes cut. In favor of Mojo who Guerin has done nothing but sing praises of. Not hard to connect these dots.Mojo isn't here because of Evason. He's here because Guerin paid him to be here. Even if Evason demanded Mojo be on the team (which didn't happen) the buck stops with Guerin. People just absolutely jumping through hoops of fire to do everything they can to blame someone other than Guerin and it's weird. It is literally his job.
wildhockey,lxub5xd,2024-11-18 18:43:23,We need a goal. Best put the one goal guy out there.Russo was mystified on the most recent Worst Seats at that decision. Where he is currently at is far better than what we've gotten from Johansson. Where Gaudreau is currently at is far better than what they've gotten from Johansson. 2023 me can't believe I typed that out just now. Johansson is like this team's asparagus. Maybe people who know better keep giving him to us but I still fucking loathe it.
wildhockey,lxmtxgt,2024-11-17 14:04:03,Ohgren is a bigger body and at least is a high effort player (especially last night). Beckman was a coaster and didn’t really want to get in the dirty areas.
wildhockey,lxnb4ix,2024-11-17 15:36:35,I thought Ohgren played a fantastic game last night if he can keep it up he would be a great replacement.
wildhockey,lxmudq3,2024-11-17 14:06:24,Couldn't disagree with that assessment more.
wildhockey,lxmzsaw,2024-11-17 14:34:57,I like this idea of trying Lauko with Boldy. Lauko was consistently beating Dallas to loose pucks last night. Saved at least 2 icing calls that I can recall.  Showed in preseason he can score.  I’m in.
wildhockey,lxn8otb,2024-11-17 15:23:27,I think Freddy is in a role that suits him. I'm glad that he's doing much better.
wildhockey,lxn60z1,2024-11-17 15:09:05,We're already icing 2 rookies. Who are you going to replace him with before the deadline?
wildhockey,lxmtqax,2024-11-17 14:03:02,Completely agree. He is second on the team in 5 v 5 points. I think a lot of the problems people have with him including mgmt is one of style/size over substance.
wildhockey,lxmnfxu,2024-11-17 13:30:27,Sounds like OP has you blocked then bro... thats lame as fuck.Evason could be blamed for carrying Mo's water to get here but Guerin and Hynes are the reason he isn't getting scratched and taken off the powerplay units for sure.
wildhockey,lxn5wcf,2024-11-17 15:08:22,I have zero idea why you can't reply to me although Reddit has been occasionally acting up for me as well. I appreciate a good disagreement because sometimes I need to be shown I'm wrong :)I believe Evason requested Johansson when Guerin checked in with him. This was an instance of me *not* indicating this was an actual truth versus something I arrived at via inference. You are correct though: Guerin is 100% on the hook for the original acquisition and the subsequent re-acqusition not to mention the 2 year extension. If Evason wanted him Guerin could have said no. He didn't.
wildhockey,lxmmton,2024-11-17 13:27:12,Doesn’t Hynes decide who plays what line especially in game decisions?
wildhockey,lxnnetu,2024-11-17 16:42:11,>And who do we hear our GM constantly talking about trading off constantly talking about needing to improve?Can you link me to where BG has been talking about this.  I can’t find anything since after the season started.  I’ve been intrested in the situation but can’t seem to find anything on it besides really vague Russo speculation for a couple months ago.
wildhockey,lxn4s9m,2024-11-17 15:02:21,Ohgren is not a bigger body. They weigh the same and Beckman is an inch taller.
wildhockey,lxn528w,2024-11-17 15:03:53,What has he done since his one great draft year season in the SHL that makes you bullish on him as an NHL player?
wildhockey,lxo0y48,2024-11-17 17:57:46,Lauko is also playing super hungry hockey. He'll beat you to pucks or die trying.  I don't know what his skill ceiling is but as a fan I'd like to see him get a shot in the top 6 while Zuccy is out.
wildhockey,lxmp8w1,2024-11-17 13:39:47,That'd be weird - I've had tons of conversations with the guy here on the sub and he's one of my most upvoted people that still post here.Is there even any evidence at all that Evason did that? I've never heard anything of the sort.
wildhockey,lxn815p,2024-11-17 15:19:59,I have not nor would I. Reddit gremlins maybe. I agree it would be lame if I had.
wildhockey,lxmn6s2,2024-11-17 13:29:09,Hynes does yes but if Guerin is commanding him to give MoJo more ice time then Hynes doesn't really have a choice unless he wants to risk insubordination
wildhockey,lxmpt1a,2024-11-17 13:42:37,Ostensibly but if Guerin tells the coach that he wants to see someone out there end of the day he's the boss and that's what happens. Like in the movie Moneyball - remember when the coach and Brad Pitt's character argue over who should be playing out there? If the GM says jump and the coach has to ask how high.If you're ever unsure of why someone is getting more minutes over someone else just look for what Guerin has said of the players. You'll find your answer real quick.
wildhockey,lxnw69f,2024-11-17 17:30:30,Ohgren just looks thicker IDK may be misremembering Beckman a bit.
wildhockey,lxog5m8,2024-11-17 19:26:06,We literally have nothing to lose by trying it at least for a game.
wildhockey,lxpx2k2,2024-11-18 01:31:32,Another thing I'm just remembering now is both Devils and Preds fans say that Hynes was very very heavily reliant on vets > rookies/kids to trust with games and lines. This could be an example of that.
wildhockey,lxn7a23,2024-11-17 15:15:52,Conjecture on my part. Just read Dean carrying a lot of water for Johansson after the acquisition and pretty sure he was the one that assured Guerin Johansson could cut it at center.
wildhockey,lxpwz3q,2024-11-18 01:30:37,My b fam I was in a testy mood this morning and just flippantly said some shit. Glad its not on your end tho
wildhockey,lxmoj8i,2024-11-17 13:36:06,I doubt if we win a game and MoJo plays 16 minutes instead of 21 minutes that BG is going to give a shit
wildhockey,lxmrx2i,2024-11-17 13:53:40,Moneyball was slightly different where the As were struggling and the GM pulled rank.  Wild aren’t struggling.
wildhockey,lxmt5vw,2024-11-17 14:00:05,Well if you asked the average fan here they'd certainly disagree with you that the Wild have not been struggling at all over the years. Teams that haven't seen struggles usually don't fire their head coaches.I'm just using the most public and prolific example I can think of so you can see the point don't get hung up on the tiny details to miss the picture. GMs dictating lines to coaches isn't some new thing it happens all the time. Again it's an understood part of the job some GMs are more involved in the lineups than others. Hell we've even seen owners dictate lines to coaches; it's a very common complaint to some fanbases.
wildhockey,lxmu1ho,2024-11-17 14:04:39,What does the Wild’s past struggles over the years have anything to do with Marcus Johanson’s playing time THIS year?  Why would BG say “hey Hines we are the 2nd best team in the league this year but based on what happened in 2022 we really need to play MoJo more”?????
wildhockey,lxn6umv,2024-11-17 15:13:35,To back up your point:*On the afternoon of Feb. 6 2020 Boudreau’s phone rang.It was Guerin.“Bill said ‘I want Zucker to be on the fourth line tonight’” Boudreau said. “He had just played a good game so I said ‘Are you sure? Can I play him on his regular line for a couple shifts and then ease him into that?’ He was pretty adamant: ‘No he’s playing on the effing fourth line tonight.’ And I said ‘OK.’”Boudreau didn’t even ask if the decision had anything to do with a pending trade. “I’ve been around long enough to know something was up” he said. “After the game we talked as coaches. ‘Uh-oh. He’s getting traded.’”Zucker was nervous too but not certain.“That was probably the first inkling that maybe I was getting moved” he said. “Then I started to wonder if maybe they were showcasing somebody else and wanted to move that player up and put him in the top six.Zucker had a good relationship with Boudreau and would usually talk to him about “things like this.” So he asked his coach for a chat.“He didn’t blow me off but it was kind of like ‘Hey I’ve got a lot going on today. Can we do it tomorrow?’” Zucker remembered. “We never had a chance to actually talk.”As it turns out Boudreau was blowing Zucker off.“I didn’t want to tell him the GM told me to put you on the fourth line” said Boudreau who was himself fired four days after the trade finally went through.And why did Guerin want Zucker on the fourth line anyway?“I wanted to see what his reaction would be when he came in and all of a sudden he was on the fourth line” Guerin said. “And that’s what we got. He played harder.”*From https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4142487/2023/02/13/jason-zucker-wild-penguins-trade?source=user-shared-article
wildhockey,lxnpzgm,2024-11-17 16:56:15,>I'm just using the most public and prolific example I can think of so you can see the pointYou should probably get a better example if you don’t want people to get hung up on it.  Beane and Howe’s dynamic was heavily fictionalized for the movie.  That conversation never happened in real life.
wildhockey,lxnfbxi,2024-11-17 15:58:42,On 2/6 the Wild were 25-22-6 56 out of 106 possible points = .528%.  They finished the season from there 10-5-1.  Maybe BG knew something.  Maybe Boudreau isn’t telling the full story.  Maybe BG got hot with Boudreau because they kept arguing about whatever.  Who knows but to say the BG picked up the phone yesterday and demanded that Hynes put MoJo in the top line and that he keep playing him there throughout the night just doesn’t add up here.
wildhockey,lxnhnko,2024-11-17 16:10:41,I agree. I'm backing up B&C's point that GM's do this. It doesn't make sense in this particular situation (to me) because if they want to trade Rossi they should be showcasing him and JoJo still has his GD NTC.
wildhockey,lxnp3om,2024-11-17 16:51:27,Yeah that’s what has me the most confused.  If we’re looking to trade Rossi why wouldn’t we be showcasing him?  I feel like there’s all this talk about trading him but I haven’t seen anything from the front office since the pre season when we were also looking to trade Gus.
wildhockey,lxjq3ax,2024-11-16 23:41:22,Appreciate your write up and I agree for the most part I think this sub is making the loss feel much worse than it really was. A one goal loss against a good team with 3 key guys out and we still had excellent defense and tending? This is just an “on to the next one” game.
wildhockey,lxjstd8,2024-11-17 00:02:18,I don't think it was an awful loss just frustrating. gus had a fantastic game and kept us in it. the Rossi thing is the only one that really bothered me. he's been on the top line basically the whole season why was Johansson up there? I would have tried hartman up there well before Johansson. hell even lauko bc he works his ass off and is quick enough to keep up with talented guys. Johansson is the weakest guy in the top 6 I don't know what I'm not seeing that the coaching staff is seeing to warrant him getting 2 periods with kaprizov and boldy.yes I know missing key top 6 players is tough and lines are gonna need to be shuffled. I just hope hynes doesn't give him top line minutes again Johansson is just not a top line player.
wildhockey,lxlic2n,2024-11-17 09:37:47,If I weren’t at the game I probably wouldn’t have been as mad but man the team just look fucking bad most the night. I don’t think it is indicative of being a bad team overall they just played badly yesterday. Also I’m just sick of losing to fucking Dallas I just hate everything about their team and coaching staff.
wildhockey,lxk7m5p,2024-11-17 02:12:32,This game proved that Gus is back in his original form. Had a few highlights saves and kept them in the game. BG needs to dump JoJo and get a legit top 6 LW/RW though.
wildhockey,lxm0ao2,2024-11-17 11:23:31,It's one game and we have 3 key players injured. If anyone is freaking out I question their mental health.
wildhockey,lxkeidj,2024-11-17 03:26:11,This was a nice loss.
wildhockey,lxn08rs,2024-11-17 14:37:25,Rossi had 0 shots
wildhockey,lxluxhd,2024-11-17 10:53:26,Faber has to score on those chances. He got paid to be a difference maker.Did Trenin even play? Everyone shreds JoJo but Trenin should start getting some heat.
wildhockey,lxnp8qj,2024-11-17 16:52:14,I’m with you. We are what only 17 games in? Last night had its messy moments and I know we are used to losing in the 1st round when we do make the playoffs but this team is doing well despite a lot of injuries and shuffling around and so I’m not writing off the season after last night.
wildhockey,lxjsnf4,2024-11-17 00:00:59,excellent defense is kinda rich for this game. Dallas had way more high danger chances than us. Giving up 39 shots isn't great. 3rd period was better but gotta play a full 60.
wildhockey,lxki6ll,2024-11-17 04:06:51,Your right. I was one who admittedly was overreacting earlier. It really wasn't a good game for us but even to keep it close at that is nice. We need to step it up though. Can't have another game like that. All over our backs and what not constantly. Gotta out maneuver and dominate the way we did towards the end.
wildhockey,lxjw7pj,2024-11-17 00:30:28,Someone said before the game (Russo or Lapanta) that Hynes wanted to keep Boldy and Kap together so they had Boldy center Kap. I just cannot for the life of me understand what makes you think “man you know that guy who scores pretty consistently with Kaprizov and is a natural center with high offensive hockey iq? Yeah Rossi? Maybe instead of putting him with Kap and Bolds we should make Bolds take draws and have MoJo up there he’s got no points basically and could use a boost.” Make it make sense someone please
wildhockey,lxl5nxa,2024-11-17 08:07:13,How would you dump Mojo and get a legit top 6 wing? He his a $2M cap hit and a legit top 6 wing is $6M+ and the Wild have almost zero cap space. Get another team to retain 70% salary and it would cost adding Zeev Buium in the trade. Yes I know that retention is limited to 50%
wildhockey,lxnr8lw,2024-11-17 17:03:09,If there are people qualified to comment on those it would certainly be Minnesota sports fans…

Only Boldy and Kap are at 3-4 Shots per game.
wildhockey,lxm3y93,2024-11-17 11:43:30,Faber is on his rookie contract lol
wildhockey,lxnqrb3,2024-11-17 17:00:27,Just funny to see fans go sour after one loss to a good team after LITERALLY OUR BEST START IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. Whether this team can perform all season I’m not sure. I know I plan to enjoy the ride regardless.
wildhockey,lxmltar,2024-11-17 13:21:50,A big reason for the 39 SOGs is because we couldn’t control the puck in our offensive zone.
wildhockey,lxjxe8b,2024-11-17 00:40:14,can't make sense of it either. not that boldy + kaprizov is a bad combo but they can both drive the offense of their respective lines playing on the wing. just so strange to take the effective 1C and boot him to the 3rd line to give those minutes to someone who hasn't looked good outside of the first 5 or so games of the season.I kinda feel bad ripping on Johansson all the time because he's a human being just like the rest of us but ffs why does the coaching staff keep relying on him like he's a star winger?
wildhockey,lxlfy13,2024-11-17 09:21:56,All add that this is simply not a cup run year. This just isn't the time to take a swing by giving up futures. Mojo's done after this year and we move on. We're not deep but we're playing a structured game and winning games. Anything we get out of this season is just a bonus.
wildhockey,lxmryes,2024-11-17 13:53:52,lol. He just upped for eight years and WILL be getting paid as an elite two way game changing franchise D man. Just saying he had a couple glorious opportunities. I still love him.
wildhockey,lxo1esc,2024-11-17 18:00:25,And leading up to the game everywhere you looked it was stats and talk about how we historically don’t do well against the Stars. I’ve been having a blast watching the team this season and so one loss against the Stars? I’ll take it and keep watching.
wildhockey,lxmok50,2024-11-17 13:36:13,They still gave up more HDCA then HDCF regardless. They were brutal in the first and second.
wildhockey,lxlkwco,2024-11-17 09:54:11,Johannson is the new Victor Rask. Where do you play him to cause the least damage?
wildhockey,lxjydqs,2024-11-17 00:48:02,I didn't feel like Boldy and Kap had chemistry at all
wildhockey,lxliuoe,2024-11-17 09:41:10,correct.This is the year to build for a Cup run. And Mojo is a big part of this team. At $2.1M he is awesome. Would not say this if his cap hit was $3.0M We need to dump MAF and get Wally seasoned long before dumping Mojo. But the goalies are what they are.
wildhockey,lxms57k,2024-11-17 13:54:51,his stick literally exploded on one of them
wildhockey,lxmor61,2024-11-17 13:37:14,Yeah it was tough to watch but a lot of those chances are because we had no offensive game until the 3rd period and even that was sus
wildhockey,lxlmahq,2024-11-17 10:02:45,shit this is spot on
wildhockey,lxjzqrf,2024-11-17 00:59:23,"yeah this game didn't seem to show it but they're on the pp together and we saw kap-ek-boldy do great things last season so I understand the urge to keep them together. it didn't seem like boldy was super comfortable at center and it was throwing off his game so I reiterate my point of ""why did you take our top line center (Rossi) off the top line?"""
wildhockey,lxjh7xr,2024-11-16 22:36:40,Honestly I’ll take it. Took a bit to figure out the chemistry with juggled lines but considering the injuries we defended well fought hard in the third hit enough posts that would’ve swung the game the other way. There’s good stuff to take away from that game.
wildhockey,lxjh5v1,2024-11-16 22:36:16,I came into this game expecting the loss. We did much better than I would’ve expected with so many important players out. I’m happy to see Gus continuing to stand strong too. Lauko is also amazing to watch I love his effort every night
wildhockey,lxjhk6t,2024-11-16 22:39:02,Request for “I miss JEEK” as new flair.
wildhockey,lxjhbyd,2024-11-16 22:37:26,wasted a gus legacy game
wildhockey,lxjh6pz,2024-11-16 22:36:26,If Rossi starts with Boldy and kaprisov I feel like it’s a different game. I know we have guys injured but still poor line choices tonight.
wildhockey,lxjh47v,2024-11-16 22:35:58,I'm so fucking tired of seeing this team getting beat by Dallas. We looked like straight ass after their first goal way too many turnovers bad passing and lazy play. Those last few minutes in the third is how we should've been playing all game. 40-23 is also not good enough. Gus was the only reason this game wasn't a complete blowout.
wildhockey,lxjibrn,2024-11-16 22:44:08,God Stars fans are the most obnoxious human beings on the planet
wildhockey,lxjh8f2,2024-11-16 22:36:45,Fuck that shit. Ugh I hate losing to the Stars more than anything. If we had Ek and Zucc I would like to think it would be different but they just have our number and I can't stand it. Why?!?!
wildhockey,lxjhf6y,2024-11-16 22:38:03,"Gus was solid Otter was too but they shot twice the number of shots and got twice the goals. I call this a ""you can't win them all"" type of game and on to the next one."
wildhockey,lxjkf2a,2024-11-16 22:58:35,I figured out why we didn't beat them. Nobody chirped in the WTFU thread. I too am guilty and just looked at it for the first time today 
wildhockey,lxjitkf,2024-11-16 22:47:28,Unfortunate outcome but you can’t tell me this team isn’t different from years past. Under Dean (love the guy) this team would’ve folded like a cheap tent after going down 0-2. Even with Brods out the defense was solid and a lot of Dallas’ shots weren’t grade A by any means. Gus stood on his head and if Boldy doesn’t clang 2 posts and Middleton 1 this game is either in OT or a win. We all know it Kap knows it but his buddy is out for awhile. He needs to start taking over games and being selfish. These spin-o-rama passes and high zone turnovers are costly. He’s got the skill to drive the net instead of looking for the cute pass.
wildhockey,lxjhdzq,2024-11-16 22:37:49,JoNo is the sixth best player on any line
wildhockey,lxjhgl9,2024-11-16 22:38:19,Who could’ve thought that it would be hard to beat a good team while missing three key players?
wildhockey,lxjhu1l,2024-11-16 22:40:53,Kirill afraid to shoot or what
wildhockey,lxji14e,2024-11-16 22:42:10,At least Winnipeg got btfo'd.
wildhockey,lxjhitu,2024-11-16 22:38:46,Not disappointed at all: solid defense amazing goaltending. Dallas had a hard time scoringWe just had too many top line guys out. We were playing handcuffed and couldn't get our offense going in the first two periods If it wasn't for the goal post this game would've gone to OT
wildhockey,lxjhv2e,2024-11-16 22:41:03,This will look a lot different in late December in Dallas assuming the boys are all healthy. This was a winnable game even missing three big players. I wouldn't get too upset about this one.
wildhockey,lxjmjv1,2024-11-16 23:14:14,Even though the loss hurts I can't wait for Lauko and Khusnutdinov to figure out their shorthanded rush cause once they click its gonna be lethal. They get at least one a game it seems like
wildhockey,lxjiaxo,2024-11-16 22:43:59,Why does it feel like we deal with massive injuries gimping this team every fucking year? It’s like clockwork
wildhockey,lxjj09i,2024-11-16 22:48:43,Annoying losing to Dallas but if we had Ek Mats and Brodin this would of been a different game.  Can’t win them all so on to the next one
wildhockey,lxjk97w,2024-11-16 22:57:25,Wasn’t enough drives to the net and sloppy turnovers. Boys fought hard though. Mojo’s game is really bad and he constantly makes poor plays and just not hard on the wall
wildhockey,lxjr63m,2024-11-16 23:49:40,For once I'd like the Stars to have to play us without half our team injured or just coming back from LTIR.
wildhockey,lxjxxhe,2024-11-17 00:44:29,only saw the 3rd period but at least that was good. dallas only scoring 2 on us is a win for me at the moment.
wildhockey,lxjh3pz,2024-11-16 22:35:52,good game gus and no one else
wildhockey,lxjmsxh,2024-11-16 23:16:04,Anyone going full doomer over this game is a fucking loser. Guys played a solid game missing some key guys. Faber played his heart out chances were had. Not gonna lose sleep over a 1-2 loss
wildhockey,lxkyyiv,2024-11-17 07:08:58,"The loss isn't fun but something I'm seeing more and more of that I think is sustainable despite injury is the inability for other teams to ""pull away.""  Every 4th or 5th game you might have a game like Philly or LA where they score 4-5 on the Wild but I'm seeing a lot of teams (even high scoring ones) left with 1 2 or rarely 3.  It doesn't really matter if Gus or Fleury is in net either.  It also didn't seem to matter that three core players were hurt.  Dallas only managed two goals.I'm getting this sense that the Wild are never ever too far away from tying or winning a game.  It didn't work with Dallas but it worked with Chicago.  They can be down almost all game but get a late score somehow.  This is the sort of defensive structure was almost unheard of in the Evason regime.  The team is buying in.  I think nearly 20 games in I'm comfortable in saying there's enough evidence to suggest that the team is going to be successful enough to face anyone's best and keep it close.  You definitely couldn't say that last year."
wildhockey,lxjhnlh,2024-11-16 22:39:41,This loss is squarely on Hynes/GuerinConceding 2 points with their line combosIf fat beerbelly slobs on their couch can see the drastic difference of the first line with/without #90 then they should both be fired for not seeing it/forcing it anyway.  I wanna know what incriminating photos Jojo has because it’s plain as day to anyone who has ever laced them up he does not fit on any team with playoff aspirations
wildhockey,lxjhtgm,2024-11-16 22:40:46,Wild need to exorcise the Dallas Demon once and for all.
wildhockey,lxjmqyg,2024-11-16 23:15:40,The D was very solid this game.  They stayed off the PK as well.  That's a silver lining I can live with I guess.
wildhockey,lxjphmh,2024-11-16 23:36:39,how was milne? i wasn't able to catch the game
wildhockey,lxji9do,2024-11-16 22:43:42,Tickets were kind of expensive for this game. Two thumbs down. 
wildhockey,lxji6cs,2024-11-16 22:43:07,We need more from Rossi. 25% in faceoffs and not a single shot on goal. Not blaming him just need better production with some of our top players out.
wildhockey,lxji217,2024-11-16 22:42:19,I don’t know that wasn’t a good effort. Only three losses this month but all very deflating. 5-1 against LA the loss to Chicago and now tonight. They didn’t look great against Montreal either and Montreal put down the hurt. The team isn’t looking confident.  Saint Louis Edmonton Calgary and Winnipeg next. Gotta beat Saint Louis and Calgary. I’ll accept a loss at Edmonton. That brings us back home for Winnipeg and the Jets are scary.
wildhockey,lxjkg6z,2024-11-16 22:58:48,Jets Kings and Stars. Those were the tests they needed to pass. Failed them all. The offensive chemistry has been off since the Kings game.
wildhockey,lxjl2w2,2024-11-16 23:03:20,Exactly. Ek or Zucc moves the needle that game.  For the folks saying the injuries are just excuses fine but the team was in it until the final horn. One of those shots off the pipe goes in that game is a W or at least a point.
wildhockey,lxji06y,2024-11-16 22:42:00,Lauko hustles every shift he’s such a big upgrade over Dewar/Duhaime/Lettieri/etc
wildhockey,lxjijwl,2024-11-16 22:45:40,Lauko is the wrench for the other teams gears and I love it
wildhockey,lxjjxev,2024-11-16 22:55:08,I'm fine with the line starting the fact it took so long to adjust out of it is the real misstep tonite.
wildhockey,lxjhbh8,2024-11-16 22:37:20,The turnovers were atrocious.  I'm going to chalk that up a bit to the lines being all FUBAR.
wildhockey,lxjhi2x,2024-11-16 22:38:37,even though Kaprizov had a goal that second one was all him just a boneheaded turn over 2 feet from your blue line
wildhockey,lxjv3n9,2024-11-17 00:21:07,"I'll give you bad passing but when ""you-know-who"" is passing to ""you-know-the-fuck-who"" it makes a difference. Period 3 showed us that play. But being down hurts a hurt team."
wildhockey,lxliu07,2024-11-17 09:41:03,Stars scored 7 goals previous 2 games. A lot of those 40 shots were perimeter shots and were expected saves. Wild defensive abilities were missing two huge pieces. Wild offensive abilities were missing two huge pieces. Don't want to hear about Stars big players not producing that's what good defensive play does. As a side note...when is the league going to recognize Marchment's diving and start giving him penalties instead of rewarding him for his acting skills?
wildhockey,lxjv62j,2024-11-17 00:21:41,Well we have 3 more chances to get em back and workshop a few chirps
wildhockey,lxlmx6z,2024-11-17 10:06:32,It's not illegal to win in this situation either-happens all the time in all sports.
wildhockey,lxjjjvs,2024-11-16 22:52:28,Yeah but it still sucks. We have guys out should be next man up not a shrug and oh well we have injuries. That’s that attitude of a loser. We don’t haven enough players to step up
wildhockey,lxjknrr,2024-11-16 23:00:18,He had our only goal so
wildhockey,lxjpd74,2024-11-16 23:35:41,yeah those guys fit real well
wildhockey,lxk2rjx,2024-11-17 01:26:28,Because we have zero depth so when a key player is out we have no hope of replacing them
wildhockey,lxjhbzt,2024-11-16 22:37:26,I liked Rossis game
wildhockey,lxjjfvl,2024-11-16 22:51:42,Actually thought Foglino had a really good game.
wildhockey,lxm3kpk,2024-11-17 11:41:28,Definitely more resilient and structured group this year and goaltending keeps them in it. I wish they had more of an attack on the rush though. Instead they like to pull back and setup which sometimes kills momentum and lets the back checkers catch up. Dallas’ second goal is a kind of an example of what happens when you just press forward.
wildhockey,lxjt839,2024-11-17 00:05:33,![gif](giphy|H7AZeCzMpjV9uF8VE1|downsized)
wildhockey,lxm3xv4,2024-11-17 11:43:26,He had a hard shift in the third I think. Kept up with the pace.  Ohgren stood out a bit more than he did earlier in the season.
wildhockey,lxk3s02,2024-11-17 01:35:17,lol let's start blaming Rossi again.  Look at his stats over the whole season not a single game.  He has overall fo % of 49 and that on the top line where you face off mostly against the top centers. So please stop.
wildhockey,lxjkyfu,2024-11-16 23:02:27,Also the little lazy plays in the defensive zone seem to be a constant now. A failed chip or rim to the opposing D blind pass to no one and gliding to pucks. Gus and Flower have kept it close so far.
wildhockey,lxjj57d,2024-11-16 22:49:38,God I hope Billy finds a way to keep him. Dude flat brings it every shift love watching him play.
wildhockey,lxjpsq4,2024-11-16 23:39:03,Kaprizov is so darn good but he seems to get into a short stretch every year where he just tries to get way too fancy. I also feel like playing him 23 minutes a game is just too much. I know he can take it and he has some absurd conditioning but it'll just wear him down long-term.
wildhockey,lxkhlej,2024-11-17 04:00:20,Agreed haha
wildhockey,lxjl6rm,2024-11-16 23:04:07,I mean at the end of the day if you’re hoping some call-up from Iowa is going to be a seamless fill-in for one half of probably the best chemistry duo in hockey you’re going to be disappointed almost constantly
wildhockey,lxjnn2h,2024-11-16 23:22:20,I mean we have exactly no players to step up. All of our step up players are playing because of the cap penalties.
wildhockey,lxli39z,2024-11-17 09:36:11,"""Next man up"" is cope.  To steal a term from baseball the Wins Above Replacement for the three injured players is significantly higher than AHL call ups"
wildhockey,lxjlsre,2024-11-16 23:08:36,Off a deflection so
wildhockey,lxjlyrx,2024-11-16 23:09:53,He didn’t shoot it…
wildhockey,lxjpqx7,2024-11-16 23:38:40,It was a tip in
wildhockey,lxjhrsf,2024-11-16 22:40:27,Middleton Spurgeon Lauko Ohgren Rossi Trenin all played well.
wildhockey,lxji00t,2024-11-16 22:41:58,Same. He should have been on the top line much sooner after our was clear Jojo was doing nothing.
wildhockey,lxm6l3e,2024-11-17 11:58:00,"What I wonder is if has to do with not wanting the game to be a ""track meet"" sort of thing if they step on the gas too much."
wildhockey,lxjv0wm,2024-11-17 00:20:29,"Yeah around the beginning of the third i was like ""Did they bench milne?"" and started looking around for him"
wildhockey,lxlhqs4,2024-11-17 09:33:55,No clue how Billy has a problem re-signing him.
wildhockey,lxjqzpr,2024-11-16 23:48:19,he was playing simple hockey when he got really hot last Christmas and beyond and now he’s attempting crazy passes and so on.
wildhockey,lxjrmoj,2024-11-16 23:53:06,That’s a ridiculous take. No Iowa player is going to fill in to a top six role and that is not what I insinuated. Our current roster of NHL players should step up to the next higher line and the AHL players should be able to fill in decently well on the 3rd/4th line.
wildhockey,lxjw9yw,2024-11-17 00:30:59,Ohgren was so good. Tonight. Fully engaged every shift. Pretty impressed
wildhockey,lxji6uk,2024-11-16 22:43:13,Rossi buries that rebound with 23 seconds left I'm so serious
wildhockey,lxm9bf8,2024-11-17 12:13:11,I didn’t think of that angle but a good point. It’s more taking advantage of the situation when it arises. The east-west plays beat goalies more often but we’ve seen that play broken up when a shot for rebound will let us into the slot against teams that clog it up.
wildhockey,lxj37yu,2024-11-16 21:03:17,"I mean the first time I saw us with the fish I was like ""oh we stole Seattle's thing""But after thinking about it this is a fun thing for kids. It gets people invested in the 3 stars and it adds more local flavor and interest which gets people excited. They should he happy to see their idea catching on rather than attempting to gatekeep. It really truly is not that deep and I doubt the majority of Seattle fans are mad beyond a couple of loud weirdos on Twitter."
wildhockey,lxiy8om,2024-11-16 20:31:38,“You can learn why it’s so important”Literally the first line is about how it’s not important and the group just thought it was funny and ran with it
wildhockey,lxj28ra,2024-11-16 20:56:53,"""couldn’t even choose a different animal orrrr?""smh dude doesnt even know that walleye and salmon are different animals"
wildhockey,lxj0ga1,2024-11-16 20:45:29,Imagine being upset about a tradition rooted in…..whatever happens at MOA. I lived a few blocks from Pike Place for a few years and it’s mostly just tourists that wander through. Locals are just grabbing a few things (shout out Daily Dozen Doughnuts!) and getting the fuck out of there.
wildhockey,lxjdwig,2024-11-16 22:14:12,We were blessed with the land of 10000 lakes. Were we just supposed to look at em?
wildhockey,lxj1les,2024-11-16 20:52:47,I love our new fish toss. I’m not the best at identifying fish but ours looks like a bass? I think they’re really leaning into the Northwoods stuff (the loon call the bear growl The Great Outdoors “let’s make noise” etc.). Fishing can be important in Seattle and important to us too. My husband and I were at the game Thursday night and purposely stayed for the 3 stars just to watch the fish toss.
wildhockey,lxj34sf,2024-11-16 21:02:43,Is there more context to this?
wildhockey,lxj79vv,2024-11-16 21:30:01,I managed a group who were based in Seattle and can tell you the reason it’s so cloudy there is the heat generated by the collective friction of everyone patting themselves on the back and the hot air they constantly blow out of their beaks being offended does not mix well with the cool fall/winter months.
wildhockey,lxj26oc,2024-11-16 20:56:32,We stole the fish toss they stole the sport 
wildhockey,lxiyhs6,2024-11-16 20:33:14,Cry babies. Fuck em.
wildhockey,lxl6u66,2024-11-17 08:16:24,Don’t people also throw fish at Nashville games??  And ofc the octopus for Detroit and Detroit doesn’t complain about stolen seafood valor.
wildhockey,lxj3jdu,2024-11-16 21:05:19,There are so many things in sports that were started by one team and then others did it and now everyone does it. Obviously not every team will start throwing fish but “stealing another team’s thing” is not a big deal.
wildhockey,lxj7pds,2024-11-16 21:32:51,I just can’t imagine getting upset about stuffed animals to children. Like at most roll your eyes about it being unoriginal.
wildhockey,lxj3pjz,2024-11-16 21:06:26,What is this even talking about? Why are the Wild singled out?
wildhockey,lxj5b4b,2024-11-16 21:17:00,"""How DARE you mock our fish tossing tradition!"""
wildhockey,lxkeh7r,2024-11-17 03:25:49,"this is actually just a ""philly fans are fucking losers"" post in diguise"
wildhockey,lxlhqkd,2024-11-17 09:33:52,Wait we’re tossing fish now?
wildhockey,lxsyfhm,2024-11-18 14:27:52,Seattle fan here to say I don't care. Have fun! I think it's silly when people get mad about a team doing another team's thing. We've experienced it with Detroit and octopus shenanigans.
wildhockey,lxizoew,2024-11-16 20:40:37,They can check the standings and move on
wildhockey,lxjiuwf,2024-11-16 22:47:43,bros have been around for 3 years and think they have a rich culture LOL. definitely tracks with my buddy who's a kraken fan and thinks they're cup contenders bc they beat Edmonton in the pre season
wildhockey,lxkjajw,2024-11-17 04:19:18,Sounds like going home with the next nights dinner 
wildhockey,lxp2cq1,2024-11-17 21:41:12,Oof as a Wild fan who lives in Seattle … I’m hiding  Honestly I don’t know how a team that’s been around three years can be mad about “traditions” being “stolen”. I’d prefer sticks though. “I went to a hockey game and got a stuff fish?” Boring.
wildhockey,lxiz1nv,2024-11-16 20:36:41,I’d be upset if I had to live in Seattle too
wildhockey,lxmiuuf,2024-11-17 13:05:56,The only state that panders harder than ours
wildhockey,lxja2q9,2024-11-16 21:48:36,I brought this up to my coworker who’s in Seattle and a STH for the Kraken and she said she heard about it but that nobody there cared. You’re probably right that it’s just a few people wanting to be upset.
wildhockey,lxt3aoi,2024-11-18 14:52:26,"Yeah I doubt many people here would care. At most you might get the ""just remember we did it first"" but it's just a little post game fun after wins gatekeeping that is dumb."
wildhockey,lxjlm8z,2024-11-16 23:07:17,I was under the impression that this was a live fish while I started to read it and I was very confused. They're upset about a stuffed salmon and they had to get indigenous approval for it? I'm all for getting everyone involved with hockey but that seems like pandering to me.
wildhockey,lxj3t9p,2024-11-16 21:07:06,Yeah I mean it’s not deep but it’s fun to start some banter and make fun of Twitter weirdos lol
wildhockey,lxiycoj,2024-11-16 20:32:20,Mediocre team needs something to feel special about I guess lol
wildhockey,lxszrfx,2024-11-18 14:34:33,"Most people don't even know there are different kinds of salmon it seems. The Kraken have used a different kind of salmon for the stuffed fish toss each season and there were people confused why it ""wasn't a salmon"" anymore."
wildhockey,lxjiziw,2024-11-16 22:48:34,average Seattle resident
wildhockey,lxj28tj,2024-11-16 20:56:54,Mention the name Camp Snoopy and this sub will riot
wildhockey,lxt0025,2024-11-18 14:35:47,Toss stuffed lakes.
wildhockey,lxj1tn4,2024-11-16 20:54:15,They are walleye
wildhockey,lxt0mru,2024-11-18 14:38:58,Personally as a Kraken fan I say welcome to the fish tossing community. I think I'd get being annoyed if we were rivals but even then gate keeping silly traditions seems ridiculous. Still throw an octopus on the ice and Detroit will want blood. Don't throw a catfish or Nashville will come for you. Fans are not always reasonable.
wildhockey,lxj3bu5,2024-11-16 21:03:58,Apparently Seattle has a tradition of tossing stuffed fish after games. The other night we had the 3 stars of the game sign and give stuffed fish out to kids in the crowd. They’re upset we copied them. This is one of the longer threads of them complaining that I found amusing
wildhockey,lxj3jar,2024-11-16 21:05:18,Kraken fans are triggered because we stole the “fish toss” because apparently Pike Place Market is the only place in the world to throw fish /s but seriously there isn’t context. It’s a team throwing stuff into the crowd after the game.
wildhockey,lxjj7n1,2024-11-16 22:50:06,wait until they find out other teams have been throwing marine animals on the ice for decades
wildhockey,lxiysy5,2024-11-16 20:35:10,They don't have playoffs to worry about. Guess a stuffed fish gives them something to care about.
wildhockey,lxjn84v,2024-11-16 23:19:12,When teams announce the three stars at the end of the game it is tradition that the 3 players throw something to fans in the stands. Often it is a stick sometimes a t-shirt or similar souvenir. Seattle wanted to do something different and developed stuffed fish to throw as a homage to the fish toss at Pikes Place Market and the general importance of fish to the area. Recently the Wild developed their own fish and some Seattle fans are upset/annoyed that the Wild appear to have copied the Kraken.
wildhockey,lxl9wv7,2024-11-17 08:39:19,I live in Pennsylvania and the Philly people drive me insane so this tracks
wildhockey,lxt1ucj,2024-11-18 14:45:05,There is a rich hockey culture in Seattle but this is not part of it. This is a silly fun post game tradition and if you all want to have fun with it too I think it's silly to be mad about that. If anything it's flattering I guess.
wildhockey,lxj0qgl,2024-11-16 20:47:16,I’m a Minnesota transplant in Seattle and the city is awesome. The Kraken fans though don’t really understand hockey and compound this by being confidently incorrect about their opinions
wildhockey,lxtxu9z,2024-11-18 17:28:23,I was honestly tempted to ask people's opinion in the Kraken sub but didn't want to overstep or cause fights.
wildhockey,lxj49x4,2024-11-16 21:10:11,Oh I'm agreeing with you that their reactions are deranged I can see where it initially rubbed them wrong though
wildhockey,lxjpx5v,2024-11-16 23:40:01,Let’s not just go throwing around the M word shall we?

wildhockey,lxj9ha9,2024-11-16 21:44:39,Mention the fact that it has been Nickelodeon Universe for a longer period of time than it was Camp Snoopy and anarchy might ensue.
wildhockey,lxj3vs0,2024-11-16 21:07:34,Well that tracks.
wildhockey,lxt27pk,2024-11-18 14:46:58,It's getting better but yeah there are still a lot of newer fans who after 3 years have just enough hockey knowledge to think they know more than they do. Of course the same could be said about a lot of hockey fans who have been fans a lot longer than that.
wildhockey,lxj99xc,2024-11-16 21:43:18,Norm

wildhockey,lxjmxsb,2024-11-16 23:17:03,It's where Killebrew hit the longest home run (522ft) in Metropolitan Stadium which used to stand where MoA was built. It goes along with the brass plate where home plate used to be.
wildhockey,lxizr4l,2024-11-16 20:41:05,Oh like an AHL reverse retro? Neat
wildhockey,lxjolt4,2024-11-16 23:29:45,Anyone else a little concerned with his season so far? Second to last in the AHL with a 4.26 GAA.https://theahl.com/stats/goalie-stats/all-teams/86?playertype=goalie&qualified=qualified&rookie=no&sort=gaa&statstype=standard&page=3&league=4

wildhockey,lxmk0od,2024-11-17 13:12:14,I miss the old whites where we used gold
wildhockey,lxtsfx1,2024-11-18 16:59:43,Do they make a Wyatt Johnston jersey?
wildhockey,lxp6o51,2024-11-17 22:08:26,As somebody who grew up in Houston going to Aeros games…I’m offended.
wildhockey,lxj03h6,2024-11-16 20:43:15,They’re all being auctioned at the end of the game.
wildhockey,lxj4g4i,2024-11-16 21:11:20,I think they did for their armed forces night or maybe just for the Veterans Day stuff.
wildhockey,lxjoyt5,2024-11-16 23:32:33,Yes.Tonight was a total meltdown. Wally broke a stick banging on the goal in frustration. I don’t know what’s going on but he’s gotta figure out how to not to let small things blow up into a total collapse.
wildhockey,lxlxqx6,2024-11-17 11:09:21,I think the coaching is terrible
wildhockey,lxn3kqn,2024-11-17 14:55:40,Not the jersey sadly but they do have some Aeros-themed merch available here: https://www.wildwear.com/heritage-collection-iowa-aeros/
wildhockey,lxj4klz,2024-11-16 21:12:08,They’ll be auctioned after the game through the Iowa Wild I believe. Sort of the the big club does with themed warmup jerseys throughout the year.
wildhockey,lxj15y1,2024-11-16 20:50:01,Dibs on shorseys
wildhockey,lxjpahb,2024-11-16 23:35:06,Tonight: Iowa had a great first period let Texas come back to tie went up one in the third then just fell apart in the last ten minutes. 5-4 turned into 5-8 in a complete meltdown.
wildhockey,lxj8vqe,2024-11-16 21:40:41,Yup - go sit in section 107.There probably will be a few online tomorrow
wildhockey,lxjqf21,2024-11-16 23:43:53,As far as Wallstedt tonight I’ll add one thing: there was a play in the second period where he made an incredible save sprawling to his left. He immediately went down and stayed down until the trainers came out. He did get back up and played the rest of the game but if he did something like pull a muscle / hamstring that could have led to that horrific third period performance.
wildhockey,lxivgdu,2024-11-16 20:14:03,Is that post-surgery? What did he have removed?
wildhockey,lxj2wda,2024-11-16 21:01:11,His balls were THAT heavy? My goodness
wildhockey,lxiywfg,2024-11-16 20:35:46,He is 5’7 or maybe even 5’6  I know this is about weight but still lol  very generous height there
wildhockey,lxjb50g,2024-11-16 21:55:41,Maybe they're listing his birth weight?
wildhockey,lxkdelc,2024-11-17 03:14:03,He hasn’t had second breakfast… positively wasting away
wildhockey,lxiy5nn,2024-11-16 20:31:06,Float like a butterfly sting like a bee and all that
wildhockey,lxk9asu,2024-11-17 02:29:57,He’s super skinny apparently and doesn’t have bones?
wildhockey,lxr0h6w,2024-11-18 08:05:36,Thats a tall ass baby
wildhockey,lxivnrp,2024-11-16 20:15:22,His everything?
wildhockey,lxiw1k8,2024-11-16 20:17:48,Everything except his balls apparently
wildhockey,lxjavnk,2024-11-16 21:53:57,legs arms torso a ball. just a head neck and his left nut now

wildhockey,lxixli6,2024-11-16 20:27:39,No they had to remove his balls this is how much he weighs now.
wildhockey,lxjs6xc,2024-11-16 23:57:22,He's Robo-Zucc now.

wildhockey,lxith65,2024-11-16 20:01:32,In a good way or bad
wildhockey,lxiym24,2024-11-16 20:33:59,"In an ""outside of our price range"" sort of way."
wildhockey,lxj2n8x,2024-11-16 20:59:30,Honestly club is my least favorite level. You can see better on the top level and the croud is better on the lower level. Either way enjoy the seats short lines and better food!
wildhockey,lxihobt,2024-11-16 18:48:51,I would like the retired numbers of the old North Stars players moved. I’m sure the folks in Dallas don’t care a bit about pre-1990 franchise history.
wildhockey,lxio53v,2024-11-16 19:28:35,Although I agree with the article it tries to push blame on the Gund brothers bad drafting in the 80s and that the arena was in the burbs.  Which I think is a wholly inaccurate take.In reality the real reasons we’re:- Norm got into a pissing contest with downtown Mpls and couldn’t come to an agreement on ad revenue for moving into target center.  He alternately tried get Bloomington to hook Met Center up to the MOA. But they kept pushing for him to move to Mpls.- He was facing sexual harassment charges.Yes the 80s sucked for that franchise but the team was doing well and selling out the arena the last couple of years when he moved the team.  Remember we made it to the Stanley Cup finals in ‘91. It’s not that Norm wasn’t making money he just wasn’t making as much money as he wanted.  That’s the real reason why they moved.That being said give us our logo name and retired numbers back.
wildhockey,lxiiebb,2024-11-16 18:53:18,Sorry Dallas the Gump Worsley photos are ours.
wildhockey,lxihoo9,2024-11-16 18:48:55,Damn thanks for sharing this! I love that the writer has both knowledge of the North Stars and the Dallas Stars. This was a powerful article. I’m not going to lie I teared up reading our history.
wildhockey,lxjldl3,2024-11-16 23:05:30,New Orleans NBA franchise gave Charlotte their Hornets name back after several years. That was a win-win for both fanbases.Edit: I didn’t finish my point… For NO’s good deed the franchise in Utah should give NO its damn name back because if there’s going to be a Utah Jazz there might as well be the Miami Eskimos or the Tampa Bay Polars.
wildhockey,lxilr40,2024-11-16 19:13:53,Numbers sure. But good god can we move on already. I don’t understand pining for this team that left you high and dry when the Wild were purely born out of love for Minnesota. They’re a love letter to Minnesota hockey. We can appreciate the past without shitting on the present. I’m so over this “change the colors bring back the north stars” bs. And then what? Have the Stars and North Stars in the same league? So derivative. Honor the history. Enjoy the past. But don’t change what I grew up with for your nostalgia sake.
wildhockey,lxime7z,2024-11-16 19:17:50,I'm almost 30 and I've never been anything but a Wild fan. Let the north stars be state hockey history but don't take away the identity of the Minnesota Wild as I and many many other fans know it
wildhockey,lxiiryt,2024-11-16 18:55:40,"I think we sort of already have. We sell merch with north stars logos we have alternate jerseys with the colors we've adopted the ""let's play hockey"" chant. We've taken back our history while also creating our own with the Wild. Perfect balance."
wildhockey,lxisf04,2024-11-16 19:54:55,I never like the name Wild and I hate the colors. The logo is nice but that is about it. I like the North Stars and the colors better. The city should keep the history when they move to a new place.
wildhockey,lxifnzt,2024-11-16 18:36:20,They're gone and never coming back. I do like the 78's as a third jersey though.
wildhockey,lxkc150,2024-11-17 02:59:12,The retired numbers are the only thing I want. Those are Minnesota history not Dallas’s. The rest can be a beloved memory that we honor with our alt jerseys and throwback sweaters.
wildhockey,lxlxarv,2024-11-17 11:06:53,I've always said that they f'd up and should have been the Dallas Lone Stars. ITS RIGHT THERE!
wildhockey,lxik7ih,2024-11-16 19:04:29,Let it friggin  go for chrissakes!!It’s like a middle-aged man still pining about his high-school girlfriend.
wildhockey,lxjd6pd,2024-11-16 22:09:24,It's time to move on. You have a generation of adult fans that were not alive during the North Star days. It's time to let it go.
wildhockey,lxijkcm,2024-11-16 19:00:30,"I'm a new fan and relatively recent (but hopefully long-term) resident of the state I love the current logo and colors BUT I can still understand older/established fans' attachment to the old logo and colors.     Side comment: since these franchises have only ever been the private property of some rich person/family/PE I don't/can't identify with a sense of ""ownership"" of or entitlement to a team's history. Maybe I'd feel different if the public had an ownership stake in the team (not just subsidies to upgrade arenas etc.)."
wildhockey,lxn7cim,2024-11-17 15:16:14,the north stars mean nothing to me why are we always trying to bring up history of a team that abandoned the state
wildhockey,lxije3j,2024-11-16 18:59:26,Or people can just let what is dead die. The North Stars have been gone as long as they were here and the Wild have had just as much success as the North Stars.Get over it already
wildhockey,lxpqn1r,2024-11-18 00:32:41,What will be harder to achieve getting the North Stars back.  Or winning a Cup?
wildhockey,lxq3dwr,2024-11-18 02:35:43,We also should get the Lakers name back no?
wildhockey,lxorqap,2024-11-17 20:35:31,I'm with Ralph on this.
wildhockey,lxp5sn6,2024-11-17 22:02:46,Clearly they have proven the stars colors work with the wild logo.  Both the RRs sold really well.  I don’t think the name needs to be changed or the logo needs to be changed but those stars colors look so sharp I would have no problem if they did a brand refresh.   Take down the number one fans banner for gods sake and put up the retired north stars player banners.  Winnipeg and the yotes did it with no issues.   I don’t think Dallas would really give a shit because they don’t know who any of those players were anyway.  Broten masterton and goldsworthy should all be up in the rafters.  It doesn’t hurt anything and give a nod to the history.   They can keep modano.
wildhockey,lxjimeo,2024-11-16 22:46:08,I wouldn’t mind if they just archived it all. Time to put it to rest.
wildhockey,lxiyfxw,2024-11-16 20:32:54,Fuck the North Stars. I’m a Wild fan
wildhockey,lxiqp3e,2024-11-16 19:44:19,Colors logo and numbers back yes. Records no. Whole heartedly agree. I’d love to have it as an alternate logo and switch to those colors if we aren’t going to use the red or wheat ever. Just give us back our history!
wildhockey,lxihsx1,2024-11-16 18:49:39,FWIW the logo & trademark belongs to the NHL as far as I know.
wildhockey,lxm805x,2024-11-17 12:05:52,This is all I pretty much want. Give the players that played here their proper respect.
wildhockey,lxmgo01,2024-11-17 12:53:58,I want those and the banners back. I go up to the HoF in Eveleth yearly and wish those hung in the rafters.
wildhockey,lxpuhcz,2024-11-18 01:07:02,Dallas has no right to our history. Period.
wildhockey,lxpf6eg,2024-11-17 23:05:42,You nailed it!  I took my four young children to a game just before Norm pulled the team. He stopped and gave all the kids Northstar pins and told them they would be watching the Northstars in Minnesota for years to come. A55hole
wildhockey,lxkqulx,2024-11-17 05:43:47,Hasek should get to publicly haymaker Brett Hull with his blocker on.  “We can change the rule tomorrow nobody will notice or care”
wildhockey,lxmrohn,2024-11-17 13:52:25,> He was facing sexual harassment charges.I'm gonna be real honest here and I'm sure it will ruffle feathers. But how much the move was based on the claims against Green I think is way way overblown. Like let's be real here - owners have done far worse shit before and since and over and over again we've seen A.) fans not give a shit and B.) the NHL not give a shit. Not to dismiss sexual harassment as a mundane thing it isn't but the NHL has seen owners and teams do shit like cover up rape and running pedophilia rings and it's never forced a move as a result - I mean shit Canada put Ballard into their HHoF for running that ring.The North Stars weren't making money and hadn't been for a long time. That's the long and short of it. There's a lot of minutiae in there sure. But end of the day if the team had been making a bunch of money none of those other things would have mattered and the team would have never moved. Fans cared more about the high school and college teams than the pro team. End of story.Also now I'm wondering - did Norm Green ever actually get charged with anything? I don't think he ever saw the inside of a court room. I'm definitely not saying he didn't do it (I absolutely believe the many women who came out against him) I'm just curious now.
wildhockey,lxn7poz,2024-11-17 15:18:14,Minnesota fans clinging to the stars is so cringe. You have a team now but you can’t enjoy them bc they have no history and can’t make any history bc they perennially blow. Clinging to the team that you stopped supporting and left town is like treating your ex so bad but then stalking them while they’ve found someone who treats them better.
wildhockey,lxptvd1,2024-11-18 01:01:24,Nice try Dallas but the Electric Stars stay with us
wildhockey,lxj0jb0,2024-11-16 20:46:01,That’s Ralph Strangis. Long time(1993-2015) Dallas Stars TV/radio play by play but started with the North Stars 3 years before they moved.Grew up listening to him and Razor in Texas before we moved up here.
wildhockey,lxipxnu,2024-11-16 19:39:39,"I agree with you Blakemore except I don't think Stars and North Stars being in the same league is a real issue. We've got Red Sox/White Sox in baseball and at least 3 ""United"" teams in MLS last I checked. They all seem to do alright."
wildhockey,lxiujsa,2024-11-16 20:08:21,"Blakemore this article is about ""honoring the history"" and ""enjoying the past"" (to use your words which you said was ok) and yet you're complaining anyways. Do we bag on other NHL teams for honoring their past? The Ottawa Senators have banners up for Cups won by a different franchise. The Jets wear throwbacks to their first iteration of a team. Do we tell the Rangers to ""move on already"" when they honor their '94 Cup team? I swear we're the only fanbase that can't compartmentalize the past and the present at all. Probably because neither franchise has had much success.We have 2 pro teams that have played here. That's just a fact. The Wild aren't changing the name or their colors (outside alt jerseys). They're the Wild. There's like an immense insecurity from young fans that feel their teams' place is tenuous or threatened or something? We can walk and chew gum. It'd be nice to have the old records back in MN. ""Getting the logo back"" doesn't mean ""wear the logo"" it can just mean they have the rights to it.    Changing the name or colors is a non-starter--it's not happening. Craig Leopold has no ties to MN before the Wild existed. The team had played almost as many seasons as the North Stars did. The Wild haven't even changed their logo once. They don't change their in-game ops much. They have some of the same traditions as they did in 2000. They're happy with where they're at. When can the North Stars be brough up and not immediately met with eye rolls and snarky ""let them die"" comments? It's getting old. We can talk about both thanks."
wildhockey,lxrq9uz,2024-11-18 10:43:45,Yesssss so sick of everyone saying they want us completely rebranded. Let it go. The 3rds are as far as it should go.
wildhockey,lxioz4v,2024-11-16 19:33:42,You didn't even grow up with a conference championship lol
wildhockey,lxioa87,2024-11-16 19:29:27,The name “Wild” is probably the lamest in all of pro sports. North Stare was infinitely better the logo is way better and there’s a history behind the team. If we could switch back to the North Stars you basically have 1967 til now of history with a 7-year gap. 
wildhockey,lxisydm,2024-11-16 19:58:14,This has no effect on the Wild identity.
wildhockey,lxj16z4,2024-11-16 20:50:11,100% with you. Northstars left when I was born. I don't give a single shit about it.The Wild jerseys logo and everything is 100% better.
wildhockey,lxij0d2,2024-11-16 18:57:06,Do you know how awesome it would be to have Neal Broten see his colors / number raised in the X?
wildhockey,lxjo61o,2024-11-16 23:26:23,The North Stars left Minnesota when I was 3 years old so effectively I'm part of the crowd that they are before my time. But I love hockey. I love Minnesota Hockey history. And the North Stars were a big part of that. They were taken from us so it's awesome that we are forceably taking those colors back as part of that history. The 78's look fantastic on the ice and Dallas has *never* adopted those colors so why shouldn't we honor that history? The Wild have *always* been about honoring Minnesota hockey history. We can retain our own identity while still acknowledging the past.
wildhockey,lxik292,2024-11-16 19:03:34,The North Stars went to the cup finals in the 80-81 season so success wise that just is not true.
wildhockey,lxik77t,2024-11-16 19:04:26,L take. North Stars history is Minnesota history. They made it to the cup final twice in their time skating in Bloomington the wild made it to a conference final and lost. I disagree that  we should let go of the history that our fathers and grandfathers watched.
wildhockey,lxiqbcz,2024-11-16 19:42:01,Wild haven’t come close to the success the North Stars had.  Fortunately they also haven’t had near the number of horrible seasons North Stars had.
wildhockey,lxqee4w,2024-11-18 04:38:29,the colors r ugly

wildhockey,lxikcwl,2024-11-16 19:05:24,You are fully correct.
wildhockey,lxo4lkj,2024-11-17 18:19:02,I think it was just another straw on the camels back. Was it the last straw?  I think it’s easy to see him saying fuck it and leaving when everything isn’t going your way.
wildhockey,lxojxra,2024-11-17 19:48:06,I read that his wife gave him an ultimatum. Move the team or get a divorce. I don’t have a source though.
wildhockey,lxpvj3g,2024-11-18 01:16:51,"Part of me wonders that so much time has passed that the Old Guard and Elder Statesmen among the hockey community here are forgetting all the bad while echoing only the rose-color-glasses perspective regarding the NS. We really only ever hear from the loud but vocal Gen-X/Boomer section of our community that really bring this stuff up. Many of them accepted the Wild but there's an even louder minority that refuse to follow the Wild and hold so much resentment.The Met was a dump just like the Dome was. The Met had a lot of issues and needed a major repair-job to it. The North Stars struggled to have a consistent product that remained competitive especially compared to their expansion sister franchises in St Louis Pitt and Philly. LAK sucked but they were able to get all time greats in Robitaille and Dionne eventually acquiring Wayne Gretzky a few years before the NS left for Dallas. Norm wanted this team elsewhere with a state of the art building and he wasn't really interested in MN because he wasn't going to get everything done his way.""How do you fail at making NHL hockey work in MN???"" by being a franchise mired in below average everything. You have to think if the NS kept guys like Dino Propp and drafted LaFontaine Yzerman Barrasso or Cam Neely do they make another run or see more success once Modano came into the fold? Maybe."
wildhockey,lxptoue,2024-11-18 00:59:43,Dallas Stars claiming they don't like us or care about us yet going out of their way to come into our sub and act like they have a pulse on the culture is cringey af my guy
wildhockey,lxnxgrs,2024-11-17 17:37:47,I mean I avoid my exes because I can because I'm not forced to see any them three or four times per year. So you know. That's a factor.

wildhockey,lxirkbd,2024-11-16 19:49:39,I mean all fair points. This one just feels different to me. It’d be like if the Utah team became the Utah Also Jets. I dunno it’s like a qualifier to the name. (What else is it exactly like?) it’s like if the White Sox were the Chicago Maroon Red Sox
wildhockey,lxixa13,2024-11-16 20:25:40,“Make the deal - make it right - give Minnesota their colors and mark back. There’s no reason not to anymore.” direct quote from the article. It’s about changing the colors and logo and name. You can shrug it off all you want (and I agree I don’t think Craig would ever change it) but there are people out there who actively shit on the Wild and refuse to get behind them. There are people that have replied to my original comment shitting on the Wild. The quality of the name is subjective but I have to believe some of the dissent for the name is that it simply isn’t north stars. We can’t walk and chew gum at the same time because there are real people who have stopped walking to continue chewing the same gum from 1991. Even in the new doc from Fox 9 they highlight fans that refuse to go to Wild games because it’s not the north stars. But the richest part of your comment is that OUR comments on enjoying the Wild is the tired conversation. Not the constant complaints and reluctance shown to a franchise that’s only reason for existence is to represent the State of Hockey (for 24 years). But now we’ve got a generation of Wild fans and suddenly OUR comments are tiresome. Despite this sentiment being a fairly recent phenomenon. Got it. My beef is not with people who as you say want to talk about both at the same time. My beef is with everyone who wants to change the history that the current generation of Minnesotans grew up with. And if you don’t think they’re out there just read the [tweets](https://x.com/br_openice/status/1800907974682292637?s=46&t=SucnhpAWkpCxGasTEWbTAQ) responding to the fake report that the Wild were rebranding.
wildhockey,lxirrw2,2024-11-16 19:50:57,Hang the banner! You’ll never sing that
wildhockey,lxir1zw,2024-11-16 19:46:30,The quality of the name is completely subjective but I completely disagree I absolutely love the Wild branding and name. And the Wild are like a year away from being here as long as the North Stars were. So sure you got to the SCF twice in those 20 some years. As far as I’m concerned both teams haven’t had much playoff success and the only history the north stars has on the Wild is just being older.
wildhockey,lxjl6km,2024-11-16 23:04:05,Read some history

wildhockey,lxiyu0h,2024-11-16 20:35:21,"My guy. It's the internet there is going to be every type of opinion out there. Do you truly know any fans in-person that won't watch the Wild because they're still heartbroken about the Stars leaving? I don't. That doc found the most diehard of Stars fans. Yeah there are maybe a handful that don't care for the Wild. They have that right.    Even an inncuous thread about a North Stars stat or history nugget is met with ""LET IT DIE!"" Everytime. So you're being disingenuous about this being one-sided. 98% of threads are about the Wild here.    I wasn't around for the North Stars. I'm a Wild fan. There's room for both. There's room for people to feel differently than you too. You don't need to have a beef with them. It's possible to just accept other people don't agree with you or are a different age or have a different view.  A lot of this is an exercise in empathy. Imagine the Wild change their name back to ""North Stars"" next year (they won't). 20 years from now kids won't know the Minnesota Wild. They'd be telling you to ""let that Wild name die."" Your feelings would be hurt. You'd question why the team you knew is getting dismissed anytime it's mentioned. The Wild's fanbase is bigger or stronger than the North Stars. So what if you see a couple comments pining for the name to come back? It'd be nice to get to a place where we can mention them and not have people bickering everytime. If you hate the mention of the team skip the thread and move on. You can do it I believe in you. There doesn't need to be a crucade to strike any mention of the North Stars nor a crucade to replace the Wild name either."
wildhockey,lxpuk39,2024-11-18 01:07:44,"The ""muh history"" narrative as if the North Stars are woven into Minnesota hockey history and need to be a scabbed to be a picked at is so blasé.As you said the Wild have been established here almost as long as the NS were. The Wild have been here long enough to actually harness some of that MN Hockey branding and inspire kids to grow up and wear the uniform when they reach the NHL. Parise Faber Prosser Goligoski Stalock just to name a few. The North Stars had the Brotens and Scott Bjugstad? Nanne and Reid are legends but were adopted sons. Modano is on a campaign to reject his Dallas affiliation and claim MN but he's a Michigan Man. Its just not the same."

wildhockey,lxjh3ux,2024-11-16 22:35:54,Honestly you gotta be proud of the boys. Fantastic effort all around kept it close and gave themselves a credible chance of going to OT in a game they had no business taking a point from. Not enough shots but they got some good ones. That pipe is still ringing.
wildhockey,lxjgf6h,2024-11-16 22:31:08,I love the effort right now. Even if we lose this. We should take comfort in knowing we pushed Dallas this hard without 3 regulars. The energy in the 3rd has felt like a playoff game

wildhockey,lxj8fx4,2024-11-16 21:37:45,Tough night for faber
wildhockey,lxj9qo8,2024-11-16 21:46:22,Gus keeping the boys in it could end up stealing this one still. Dallas has a ton of shots but they aren’t getting grade A after grade A by any means. The Wild had about 3 great looks that period. Mids Faber and Freddy all had great looks. Would imagine we see some sort of a blender to start the 3rd. All things considered this game is still winnable.

wildhockey,lxjgu43,2024-11-16 22:34:01,Gus played amazing this game and we did play a strong game. Proud of the boys with how short handed they were. This felt like a playoff game
wildhockey,lxjgvhu,2024-11-16 22:34:16,Unfortunate L. Boys were not sharp except Gus. First two periods wasted with Jojo dragging down the top line.

wildhockey,lxjejpb,2024-11-16 22:18:26,Im so over Kaprizovs unwillingness to drive the play and sometimes be selfish just pure refuseal to shoot. Its killing us when u have zero space in games like this. You need to create offense sometimes by yourself
wildhockey,lxjg3ap,2024-11-16 22:28:52,Boldy has been throwing blind passes ALL NIGHT LONG. So many turnovers
wildhockey,lxim32h,2024-11-16 19:15:55,This is always a big matchup but especially now. They’ve kicked our ass in recent playoffs. They took our discarded trash (Suter) and threw it in our face. NO MORE! Tonight we feast on Dallas hopes and dreams! WE ARE MN HOCKEY!
wildhockey,lxirutq,2024-11-16 19:51:27,Best team aside from the Jets they’re facing this season. Wish the Wild were healthy to get a good idea of the matchup

wildhockey,lxj8je9,2024-11-16 21:38:24,Why did this make me giggle so much?
wildhockey,lxj8n4o,2024-11-16 21:39:06,I just said to my wife “Kap needs to remember Zucc isn’t out there”
wildhockey,lxj9yp4,2024-11-16 21:47:51,Ek or Zucc definitely moves the needle a bit this game especially on the PP.
wildhockey,lxj9urv,2024-11-16 21:47:07,u right
wildhockey,lxjd3ph,2024-11-16 22:08:50,Well if we want to win we technically need 2 good things.
wildhockey,lxj0mtf,2024-11-16 20:46:38,You get to boo him next game!
wildhockey,lxj1kgj,2024-11-16 20:52:36,i don't like that this cat is judging me
wildhockey,lxizflm,2024-11-16 20:39:06,Congrats Grapes!
wildhockey,lxizjqw,2024-11-16 20:39:49,Go Grapes!
wildhockey,lxizrih,2024-11-16 20:41:09,One of those that at real speed you're never going to see it unless you're right where the camera (and the ref) was.Probably why Dumba fought so hard he likely felt he shouldn't have had to.  Whatever.  On with the game and I still like both players.  It's just hockey.

wildhockey,lxjg0az,2024-11-16 22:28:16,Just one of countless reasons. Scum of the Earth that guy is. Hate is a strong word and Benn comes  closer than anybody else I can think of to being worthy.

wildhockey,lxj7mrf,2024-11-16 21:32:22,Yes. Gus standing on his head. Wild have had a few good looks but Dallas has had more.
wildhockey,lxj7p0o,2024-11-16 21:32:47,The Bus is keeping it 1-0
wildhockey,lxjbcqg,2024-11-16 21:57:06,And fuck Norm Green
wildhockey,lxjddsz,2024-11-16 22:10:42,Wes is a joke. Loved Pants correcting the error like to think he got a kick outta it. At the same time Pants is a professional.
wildhockey,lxiwm0y,2024-11-16 20:21:24,Depends on the game usually. We had a few rockin ones a few quiet ones
wildhockey,lxiwsl5,2024-11-16 20:22:33,Early in the season and the critics have been kept pretty quiet. A three game losing streak and they’ll be vocal again
wildhockey,lxiztj7,2024-11-16 20:41:30,Won the first lost the second
wildhockey,lxj3bs6,2024-11-16 21:03:58,Fights and Dallas scoring
wildhockey,lxj3jrs,2024-11-16 21:05:23,2 fights 1/1PK..Wild sitting back too much the last 5mins Boldy with a grade A but flipped a backhand over the net. Gus sharp lost a questionable draw and they scored on a deflection.
wildhockey,lxitsps,2024-11-16 20:03:33,bringing back the late 90s/early 2000s. Gonna be in a boy band at the end of the year.
wildhockey,lxiuvlq,2024-11-16 20:10:23,Establish dominance.
wildhockey,lxiy8h6,2024-11-16 20:31:36,donated his balls to Zuc
wildhockey,lxiyfel,2024-11-16 20:32:48,Should be short term
wildhockey,lxj45q9,2024-11-16 21:09:25,I missed it. Did it end with Spurge introducing Benn to his 5 friends?
wildhockey,lxj8mhh,2024-11-16 21:38:58,You know in your heart that he's Freak4Freak!
wildhockey,lxjd7qc,2024-11-16 22:09:35,Hell I'd settle for an OTL at this point
wildhockey,lxj1stj,2024-11-16 20:54:06,I seem to remember him doing a little better at the very beginning of the season and I thought things would start looking up for him.But maybe I imagined the entire thing and he’s just been bad the entire time.
wildhockey,lxivj9o,2024-11-16 20:14:34,He’s still in goal but the arena got reeeeal quiet.
wildhockey,lxiwwka,2024-11-16 20:23:15,I unfortunately agree with this. There are tons of people who are literally silent until things go wrong.
wildhockey,lxj4bqe,2024-11-16 21:10:31,I fuckin wish
rangers,lxtpski,2024-11-18 16:46:19,It’s not looking like he’s going to make a quick return. Center depth in Hartford isn’t great. Realistically what (good) center options are out there for a trade?
rangers,lxts0hn,2024-11-18 16:57:33,#It’s Never too early to start drinking on a Monday
rangers,lxtx5xz,2024-11-18 17:24:46,Throwing Gus Nyquist out there as a rental from a very bad Preds team.
rangers,lxtr7fy,2024-11-18 16:53:27,Remember this name Yanni Gourde. It has to be him. No exceptions
rangers,lxu99kf,2024-11-18 18:32:19,Andreas Athanasiou Morgan Geekie or Yanni Gourde would be the 3 options i would like the Rangers to pursue if the Chytil new is worse than expected. I want to make sure we are talking about the human and just want the guy to stay healthy outside of hockey.
rangers,lxtuze3,2024-11-18 17:13:03,Thats also why I think he's better as a trade candidate than as an investment. Hope for the best.
rangers,lxtr08j,2024-11-18 16:52:27,All roads lead to greg mckeg
rangers,lxtswgl,2024-11-18 17:02:07,Definitely no to Zegras and HELL NO to Malkin(that’s for those who actually want him)
rangers,lxtybxg,2024-11-18 17:31:00,You gotta think they’ll turn it around at some point though right lol
rangers,lxtyhpg,2024-11-18 17:31:53,The Preds are my Western team. The team seems to have enough flashes of decent play to keep Trotz from completely blowing things up. The Preds center depth is also a mess. They’re going probably to want a C prospect or a decent pick back in return for Gus.
rangers,lxtrjey,2024-11-18 16:55:08,He’s a good option. He would also be a good mentor for Berard and Sykora. What does the trade package look like?
rangers,lxtt3ju,2024-11-18 17:03:09,This would require waiting until the deadline or putting Chytil on LTIR or offloading some salary.  I would offer:Ryan Lindgren Kaapo Kakko Brennan Othmann and 1st Round PickFor Yanni Gourde and Shane WrightChange of scenery for Kakko and Wright Othmann gets a chance right away with Seattle.
rangers,lxts3hg,2024-11-18 16:57:58,The Leg has returned
rangers,lxtxien,2024-11-18 17:26:37,Zegras isn’t that bad
rangers,lxtv52u,2024-11-18 17:13:54,Anyone actually saying Malkin must be new fans lol
rangers,lxu0yyp,2024-11-18 17:45:13,What did I miss? I don't think it'd ever happen anyways but why does everyone in here hate Malkin?
rangers,lxtzyb0,2024-11-18 17:39:43,Turn it around when the avs are in the process of turning it around and the top 3 teams in your division are the jets wild and stars really isn't possible.
rangers,lxtsjd5,2024-11-18 17:00:14,That idk. He’s a good option bc he’s a player that will bring snarl playoff goal scoring and Jam. Plus he gets to the middle of the net aka North/South.Also he’d fit that line with Cuylle and Kakko very well
rangers,lxtrnzu,2024-11-18 16:55:47,Matthew Robertson you are a Seattle kraken
rangers,lxtvad1,2024-11-18 17:14:41,The disrespect
rangers,lxtuvu4,2024-11-18 17:12:32,Lindy for all his flaws is a solid d-man when healthy. The Rangers don’t have that much depth on the left side. Trading him means that we need another solid LHD option.
rangers,lxtwc4v,2024-11-18 17:20:19,Trading Kakko would be stupid bc gourde would fit perfectly between Cuylle and Kakko
rangers,lxtwhqg,2024-11-18 17:21:09,what in the HFBoards is this trade proposal
rangers,lxu0ips,2024-11-18 17:42:46,Nuclear bad trade offer holy shit
rangers,lxu90fg,2024-11-18 18:30:50,The way he presents himself is divisive. A change of scenery might make things click for him. He trains with Kreider and Quick in the off season.
rangers,lxtw4fk,2024-11-18 17:19:10,Or fans that are want his “jersey in rangers colors” too lol
rangers,lxu32um,2024-11-18 17:56:48,Nobody is saying they hate him... he's 38
rangers,lxu35gl,2024-11-18 17:57:12,He’s old he’s a penguin and he’d cost way too much for his value. It’s bc people want “names” bc they were successful elsewhere
rangers,lxu0lcw,2024-11-18 17:43:10,They need to find another U2 concert to cancel. Happy and Juice are about the only players worth watching games for. Although last nights game was actually decent. Hopefully they didn’t rile the Canucks up too much.
rangers,lxts317,2024-11-18 16:57:54, I think it’s going to take more than just one (likely) career AHL d-man. He’s young but he doesn’t seem all that promising.
rangers,lxtvjjw,2024-11-18 17:16:02,This team needs a jolt not a minor move.  To win the Cup this team needs a lot more.
rangers,lxtya3i,2024-11-18 17:30:44,But they can get something for him instead of him walking as a UFA.
rangers,lxu3ila,2024-11-18 17:59:14,I think he needs to turn off his nhl 25 Gm mode
rangers,lxty4w3,2024-11-18 17:29:57,It’s my inner Bern speaking.
rangers,lxu3uoi,2024-11-18 18:01:08,Idk I've seen a few people on here calling him a POS and just seeming to dislike him I just thought i missed somethingEdit: [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/rangers/s/2RIwp3Eklf) is one I replied to so could find it quickly but there was definitely more and the upvotes lead me to believe others feel this way about him.
rangers,lxu3oby,2024-11-18 18:00:08,Not Josi? I mean… he’s a man rocket lol
rangers,lxtwk1q,2024-11-18 17:21:30,And that move is trading Kakko + for two centers who’s combined production is less than Kakkos despite each of them playing more games than him?
rangers,lxtz9xb,2024-11-18 17:36:06,We need defensive depth if we’re going to make a cup run. I’d take Lindy over Harpur any day even if it means he walks for free. It’s also clear how important he is to the locker room. He’s been a big part of the heart and sole of the team. Trading Lindgren mid-season needs to come with clear upside for the team.
rangers,lxu3xpk,2024-11-18 18:01:36,Josi and Skjei have struggled as a pairing (Josi is also being forced to play on his offside because of the lack of RHD). Josi is starting to get things going but it was painful for a while. For more context the coach apologized for the team collective lack of effort and the GM called them the “perimeter Preds” earlier in the season.
rangers,lxtxxku,2024-11-18 17:28:52,Kakko probably won’t be here next season for cap reasons.  Same thing with Lindgren.  With Shesterkin (hopefully) and Laf’s extensions kicking in next season Lindgren will not be back as well as Trouba probably at 50% retained.  Add in a Miller extension and this team will look quite different next season.  The only locks coming back are Zibanejad Panarin Trocheck Lafreniere Cuylle Chytil (if healthy) Vesey Edstrom Fox and Schneider.  Everyone else is a question mark.
rangers,lxu0ra0,2024-11-18 17:44:03,Victor Mancini.
rangers,lxtyrvr,2024-11-18 17:33:24,Even if you think it’s a good move its a horrific overpay
rangers,lxu95wz,2024-11-18 18:31:43,Didn't laf already sign a deal?
rangers,lxu12ux,2024-11-18 17:45:48,Is a righty and an untested rookie.
rangers,lxu172p,2024-11-18 17:46:26,Fine let’s keep Kakko and trade him in the offseason for a 2nd Rounder lose Lindgren as a UFA have Othmann in Hartford again and draft a center at pick 27 in the 1st Round next season who will help us 3 years from now.  Forgot to mention all of this happens after going out in the 1st Round this season to the Devils or Hurricanes after they mortgage some of their future to make a run in the playoffs.  Teams that have won the Cup have to give up their future.
rangers,lxt8i3r,2024-11-18 15:19:06,Remember when Colorado couldn’t win a game to start the season. Or Edmonton. They were just slumping which happens over a long season. That same phenomenon happened to us the past few weeks.  The overreacting on here and Twitter was unbearable. We are on pace for 118 points. We are a very good team.
rangers,lxteeng,2024-11-18 15:49:01,Moreover last night was one if our best ice time distributions of the year. The panarin line all got first line minutes while the zibby and Jonny Broadway lines each got a touch over third line minutes while our fourth line played 10/11 minutes. The monumental improvement is only troch played over 20 mins and Zibby played under 15!
rangers,lxtesvx,2024-11-18 15:50:58,[forward](https://hockeyviz.com/fixedImg/forwardCombos/2425/NYR/wrap) and [defense](https://hockeyviz.com/fixedImg/defenderCombos/2425/NYR/wrap) chemistry visualized
rangers,lxu6vpu,2024-11-18 18:18:31,Igor obviously the problem /s
rangers,lxt8q0x,2024-11-18 15:20:13,Admittedly those lines weren’t working. It’s a good thing it was changed back. 118 in a wild card is wild. Technically third in the division but we don’t have anything to prove until April
rangers,lxu42t6,2024-11-18 18:02:23,There’s a difference between losing because your goalie couldn’t stop a beach ball and losing because you have roughly 12-15 guys skating around like headless chickens. Neither are necessarily guaranteed to be consistent trends but one is based off results and the other is process-oriented. Results typically average out over time the process might not without some legwork or changes.We’re a good team for sure but we should be proactive about making sure the process is good rather than hoping for amazing goaltending or special teams all the time.
rangers,lxtgyo2,2024-11-18 16:01:46,That’s probably a function of no PP or PK time so they could just roll 4 lines.
rangers,lxtcv81,2024-11-18 15:41:17,Side note but related why have the devils played so many games? Like I understood the first 10 games or so since they had a 2 game head start but now only them and Pittsburgh have 20 or more games played
rangers,lxtl9tp,2024-11-18 16:23:25,It's a function of that plus the scoreboard. The thing that helped the most was lavy deciding to lean on the French Trost line while the game was close or tied instead of overplaying zibby's line Over the past year plus in similar situations lavy (and gallant before him) usually would choose to give the primary scoring minutes to zibby's line while sprinkling in panarin and trocheck and cutting everyone else's minutes. This is very much how lavy managed through the playoffs last year if you recall. The momentous thing is this year lavy is showing recognition that the core of the team has shifted away from krieder and zibby and to bread-troch-laffy and that krieder and zibby play way tf better in all 3 zones with more limited ice time. NB: Mathematically rolling 4 lines equates to about 15 mins of ice time per forward. So we can see that zibby's and Jonny's lines approximate this level of usage while the Carrick line got about 10.5 mins on rough average so it's pretty clear that troch's line getting about 19 mins on rough average was slightly less than double shifted through out the game. Since the vast majority of the game was played at evens the only explanation left for such an icetime distribution is coaching strategy.
rangers,lxte4m0,2024-11-18 15:47:37,Just the way it goes with the league's awful scheduling. Feels like we play once a week
rangers,lxsnyeh,2024-11-18 13:35:28,I fully agree with the article. Some team’s structure and identity doesn’t require lights out goaltending. Seems we always have a team that *does* need it.
rangers,lxsp7rc,2024-11-18 13:41:49,I’m okay with 11.641
rangers,lxsz0bh,2024-11-18 14:30:46,Igor is gonna get shelled night in and night out when he takes too much cap away from building a quality team around him
rangers,lxt5c4v,2024-11-18 15:02:45,Hat to bring up Brodeur because I dislike him and those Devils teams but he pissed a lot of goalies off taking team friendly deals to ensure they won above all else. I’d love for Igor to get as much money as he can and I don’t care about spending Dolan’s money but if winning is the goal his contract shouldn’t prevent the team from doing so. I’m just so torn on this topic. We also saw Hank never win a cup sooo…
rangers,lxt0vjd,2024-11-18 14:40:12,Without Shesty it’s a whole different ballgame. We are likely moving on from Trouba and Lindgren but unless we are getting at least 1 more top pair defenseman another quality top 4 defenseman and a solid two-way Center to help out upfront we’ll regress. Shesterkin and Lundqvist before him covered up a lot of the teams flaws through their netminding. Also we can’t expect Quick to replicate his play as he continues to get older. Our best bet would be to find a quality goaltender but that’s a lot easier said than done. Honestly I’m in the camp of pay Shesty around $11.5m and revamp the D in the offseason. If we can’t come to an agreement then I can see us doing a retool over the next few years.
rangers,lxti3qs,2024-11-18 16:07:32,I’m jaded and have been disappointed too much by this team but I don’t think we win a cup paying him 12 million a year. We probably don’t without him either but it gives us the chance of finding another good cheaper goalie and building a better team.
rangers,lxsp1is,2024-11-18 13:40:57,Remember what happened with DiPietro? These multi year deals suck even if they do get bought out
rangers,lxtngcn,2024-11-18 16:34:29,If your “team structure” REQUIRES high end goaltending to “be competitive” the actual take away is that your team is not actually good enough.  If your goal is to make the playoffs every year sure pay Igor. No doubt that’s good enough for Dolan.
rangers,lxtuh2f,2024-11-18 17:10:22,Honestly for me I’d 100% take 12x5 particularly because of Laf signing for a massive discount now we don’t need to worry about his extension.
rangers,lxu1vtu,2024-11-18 17:50:11,I'm only okay with paying him 9.5 Mil anything higher is too much imo
rangers,lxsxvy3,2024-11-18 14:25:08,Let's say the Rangers hold firm at $11.5mil AAV and Shesty goes to free agency and signs for more money with Anaheim (or some other team flush with cap space) where does that leave the Rangers?There are decent goalies available in free agency (or there's the off chance Garand is ready to be 1B to a re-signed Quick's 1A) plus who knows who is available in a trade but how much of a drop off will that be and can the Rangers overcome it? They'll have a lot more cap space available and could afford a solid LHD to replace Lindgren but is replacing Lindgren and possibly Trouba enough fix our defensive issues and tendency to get shelled in games we play forcheck heavy teams? Barring any other moves there are two more roster spots the team needs to address a middle six wing to replace Smith and a 4th line wing to replace Vesey. When the thought was that Shesty was coming back letting young guys (Berard/Othmann/Perreault and Rempe/Sykora) battle for the spots made sense because we needed cheap roster players. But without a huge Shesty cap hit does Drury still go that route or does he instead bring in higher priced free agents because there is more of a reluctance to rely on rookies and their growing pains without Shesty back there?I don't know the answers and I don't get paid anything to figure them out but this seems like a big make or break off-season for Drury.
rangers,lxt4gvw,2024-11-18 14:58:22,I think the team should be built around Igor in its upcoming structure cycle
rangers,lxtpy82,2024-11-18 16:47:06,James Dolan has the money Igor Shesterkin is worth the money pay the man. What else is there to it? The cap structure is significant but then it requires finding a goalie that will shake loose to be paid less for equal play. Also an apples to oranges comparison but if the Dodgers can use some funny financing to reduce the cap hit for Ohtani then the Rangers should be able to find a workout for Igor. Again pay the man finish this silly saga that is likely to end with him getting paid anyway and lets move on with the season.
rangers,lxspasd,2024-11-18 13:42:15,Lol fair enough
rangers,lxt7s0j,2024-11-18 15:15:21,The issue is that he’s already getting shelled. The Rangers are in the bottom 5 in the league in expected goals against yet their actual goals against is top 5 in the league. That dichotomy is because of horrendous team defense but incredible goaltending (Quick included). If the Rangers were simply getting NHL average goaltending this season with all else being equal they would likely have a win/loss record in the bottom 1/3 of the league and would be outside the playoff bubble.  If I’m Igor I’m thinking to myself that paying me $11+ mil a year locks down money that would otherwise go to the Lindgrens Troubas and Zibanejads of the world. This would be a good thing. Having money to spend under the cap is only positive when it’s spent right. Drury like all NHL GMs has been far from flawless in the large money contracts he’s given out.
rangers,lxtjn52,2024-11-18 16:15:14,The team with the highest goalie cap hit in the league just won the Cup.
rangers,lxt9e47,2024-11-18 15:23:36,He’s making what 5M right now? I’d argue he already gets shelled night in and night out….so is he to believe if he just takes another cheap deal that’ll stop happening?
rangers,lxt80sc,2024-11-18 15:16:36,On the flip side Benoit Allaire has taken a reduced role with the team. So goalie depth isn’t as much of a sure thing anymore. The amount of mistakes our defensive corp makes right now I can’t even imagine how bad we’d get lit up without him. The Rangers are painted into a corner so unless they got a good plan for retooling our defense with the cap space (and fast) Igor has to get paid.
rangers,lxt52u8,2024-11-18 15:01:25,And if he wants that money hes gonna have to understand that. He better get his work’s worth
rangers,lxt2ls7,2024-11-18 14:48:57,True there’s a balance to it
rangers,lxtzjx1,2024-11-18 17:37:34,I'm sure Dolans pockets run deeper than the salary cap so I don't really think anyone else cares about spending his money either. It's really about being able to dress a decent team in front of him
rangers,lxt2g5d,2024-11-18 14:48:09,Quick has been great so far this season but I agree he’s not going to be what Igor would be down the road. And I dunno what goalie we could get to do it if one’s available they’ll cost major $ too. We honestly need to rework defense either way so I guess the question is can we do it without Igor or without the $.
rangers,lxtzo5b,2024-11-18 17:38:12,We don’t win a Cup now paying Mika $8.5 million to score 3 goals so far this season. Igor will get paid. Whether it’s the Rangers or some other team he is elite. I am a fan of his and the Team but part of me wonders if he prioritizes winning if he’s better off just leaving. Hank2.0 may sound nice to Igor’s wallet but if winning the Cup is a priority gotta say it doesn’t look good for the Rangers winning it even if he signs for $5 million.
rangers,lxsr384,2024-11-18 13:51:11,One of these things is not like the other.
rangers,lxt0zzi,2024-11-18 14:40:50,Yea I could see the argument for letting Igor go and using the $ to invest in a defense less reliant on above and beyond goaltending. The growing pains from that could be rough on the other hand there’s been times trying to develop the young cheap players to keep Igor $ available has been rough too. No idea how they’ll make that judgement call behind the scenes but seems like we’ll have to pick because losing Igor and otherwise keeping course will not work.
rangers,lxtkj1o,2024-11-18 16:19:41,Not a good idea - it's a single point of failure. What happens if Igor get's injured? You have a lot more to work with if you build by balancing the cap around the team rather than going all in on the goalie.
rangers,lxt90ph,2024-11-18 15:21:42,Great take on it all. Though I think Drury does deserve a lot of credit on the good signings as well.
rangers,lxtb4j2,2024-11-18 15:32:27,There's no guarantee that it will get better with a more team friendly deal. But there is an almost certainty that taking a non-team friendly deal will make things worse
rangers,lxt36cl,2024-11-18 14:51:49,I don’t think it’s impossible but Igor is a proven commodity and I really don’t trust the FO’s talent assessment for defenseman. We’ve gone from Staal Girardi Boyle Yandle to Shattenkirk Trouba and Lindgren. Fox fell into our lap and Miller might be topping as a top 4 D. Even Schneider and Mancini have the same attributes (big strong D that aren’t great at moving the puck out). Rangers continue to prioritize tough physical D that are unable to move the puck or actually limit chances. Until the FO can better evaluate Defenseman then might as well stick with what works
rangers,lxsujv0,2024-11-18 14:08:28,It’s a comment about value not the player. Value is based on what you get today and what you get tomorrow. Discount tomorrow’s value by risk (of injury and/or degraded performance). There’s a tipping point where you’re overpaying both for risk and tying up capital that might be necessary in the future given a budget constrained system
rangers,lxttdvs,2024-11-18 17:04:39,But the same can be said with any superstar on a team. A lot of cap opens in the near future thankfully plus the overhead extensions of NHL cap over the next few years. Big money opens up and then there’s still a fair bit left over to build the best team out of the money left over (which FO will find a way to get done because they actually have brains vs some other teams lol). 5M opens up from Igor’s contract termination so the difference is whats needed to look at. My philosophy is that having a goaltending issue is more frustrating than not having a goaltending issue. And the big money spent on any player is always going to have that risk. And also not to dig extra but Igor shows up far more than the big skater contracts that are dealt out (Trouba Mika (as a current callout)). Id dig Panarin also because he’s a big name that can more often disappear in the playoffs (something Igor performs well in)….but Panarin is still one of the most fierce players in the NHL with his high point seasons so I like him more.
rangers,lxu02l4,2024-11-18 17:40:21,Isn’t Mika at 8.5 mil a single point of failure currently for the rangers icing a competent 1C capable of leading a team to a Cup win?
rangers,lxsy517,2024-11-18 14:26:24,I think the point they were trying to make is DiPietro got signed to an INSANE deal (much much longer than we can even sign Igor to under the current CBA) and he was not a proven performer when they signed him. Igor has already accomplished more than DiPietro ever did and has more than proven himself.
rangers,lxtsyjw,2024-11-18 17:02:25,That’s fair (and a better reply if we actually wanted to exchange ideas). The calculus I’m trying to do is at what price point is this dude just not worth dollars. There’s a lot of players who fall off after securing the bag
rangers,lxsd1kn,2024-11-18 12:40:47,Jonathan Quick is falling into the Living Legend category when it comes to goaltenders. We have been very fortunate with our goalie tandems recently.
rangers,lxsfrn9,2024-11-18 12:54:19,He’s really fun to watch play. I love the way he moves side to side to watch the puck. What a great signing he turned out to be. His teammates really seem to like him too.
rangers,lxsp2w1,2024-11-18 13:41:08,this is made so much sweeter by the fact that he grew up a Rangers fan.
rangers,lxsnulg,2024-11-18 13:34:57,If MAF did this it would be all over r/hockey. They just love that guy over there for whatever reason. Congrats quick! I can’t believe I’m rooting for you lmao.

rangers,lxrt5je,2024-11-18 10:59:02,I said earlier this year how he was playing with so much swagger now that he doesn't have to worry about being scratched and then he was immediately scratched. So I have nothing to say about this excellent defenseman who plays for the New York Rangers.
rangers,lxrneh0,2024-11-18 10:28:09,I love Lindgren. But it’s time to move off. Even if it’s just IR him until he’s 100% and then see where we stand on injuries.
rangers,lxs6acq,2024-11-18 12:06:49,Let’s all be happy that Zac Jones looks here to stay and that we got him. He’s exactly the lightning rod we need right now. We look so much better with another offensive dynamo on the blue line.

rangers,lxruk1g,2024-11-18 11:06:30,He's basically among the top 14% of defensemen in the NHL according to Hockey Stat Cards. I haven't been a fan of the new way HSC has conducted their metrics this season because (in layman's terms) they added a bunch of weight adjustments to their game score model which I don't think makes sense to do on an individual game basisBut either way he's good #JonesIsGood
rangers,lxs7y8z,2024-11-18 12:15:17,He’s good.
rangers,lxrpt4s,2024-11-18 10:41:15,Dom Luszcsyszyn calculated expected goals for and against while Jones was on ice & compared that to other players around the league likely with some tweaking for quality of teammates & quality of competition. Jones is well above average in both. This comparison may also include Game Score.Expected goals (xG) is a stat calculated from number of shots combined with shot location. It's not a perfect stat but it does have value.I'm not 100% sure what Game Score is - I think it includes xG but also incorporates actual scoring.This card is a way of showing that NYR did more good things than bad with Jones on the ice.They should leave him in the lineup.
rangers,lxrvq0h,2024-11-18 11:12:40,Even when he can’t connect and the puck is iced it’s still such a fast transition Puck head up pass. Not some waiting and waiting
rangers,lxrnyul,2024-11-18 10:31:15,This is the best take. Besides Lavi being stubborn there's no reason to not long term Lindgren and let him actually heal up and get back to 100%.
rangers,lxrpu5w,2024-11-18 10:41:24,I actually don’t fully mind him paired with Trouba—they played pretty well last night (and I was fairly critical of them against San Jose). Sure they’re not the best at moving the puck out of the zone but I actually think in some bizarre turn of events Lindgren is a better partner for Trouba than Miller and Miller is a better partner for Fox than Lindgren. Lindgren gives Trouba a D partner who is rarely caught out of position while Miller somehow allows Fox to play more aggressively (I haven’t been able to figure this one out yet).
rangers,lxroou8,2024-11-18 10:35:12,Lindgren Trouba is actually a net positive pair for the admittedly very small sample size. Let’s run those two for a bit and see how it goes. I’m willing to give them a leash if they continue to look halfway effective since we do need guys to take some abuse in the playoffs
rangers,lxs6xjc,2024-11-18 12:10:07,I'm happy he's playing. I was really annoyed when they benched him. He was never the problem always the scapegoat. This team doesn't know how to evaluate defensemen.
rangers,lxttfe6,2024-11-18 17:04:51,He won’t be buried in Hartford. He would have to pass through waivers which he definitely wouldn’t clear.
rangers,lxtaz5y,2024-11-18 15:31:42,Infuriating that he rode the bench during last year's playoffs
rangers,lxrwy4z,2024-11-18 11:19:06,![gif](giphy|2SfiEwabLGEQDCz8Hu)
rangers,lxu63sm,2024-11-18 18:14:01,But also Gauthier is good and DeAngelo is good. And we all know those two aren’t in the NHL anymore. xG does not always land you in the NHL actual impact does. This is only an xG metric.
rangers,lxs3dgc,2024-11-18 11:51:59,that's partially because he's been dragged down by Lindgren the past season. Lindgren was pretty bad last year.
rangers,lxrprjt,2024-11-18 10:41:00,Just copied this reply from a different thread but absolutely relevant here:Tbh he looked like our best defenseman last year down the stretch when he was in daily. He 100% should’ve been in for Miller during the playoffs. Miller was fucking horrific and Zac Jones was just WAY TOO GOOD for him not to even play one game. Lindy Trouba and Miller all could’ve been healthy scratched on any given day. Idgaf who you are come playoff time nobody should be safe.Jones in that lineup helps us win the Carolina series faster and probably helps us win at least 1 more game against Florida.That’s how good he was. That’s how bad miller was.
rangers,lxsuty2,2024-11-18 14:09:51,I was fucking furious he didn’t play in the post season. It was so goddamn obvious
rangers,lxs4j1q,2024-11-18 11:57:50,Not probably definitely should have been but something something loyalty to the vets vs loyalty to winning.
rangers,lxts7o0,2024-11-18 16:58:34,There’s 192 top 6 defenseman so that would mean Jones is 27th best overall or playing at a top 1D level.
rangers,lxsqmra,2024-11-18 13:48:56,Neat thank you!
rangers,lxsgznj,2024-11-18 13:00:23,Is don LeShits dad?
rangers,lxrok8b,2024-11-18 10:34:31,I agree he shouldn’t be playing but putting him on LTIR will have an effect on how much cap space the team can clear up before the trade deadline.
rangers,lxrumen,2024-11-18 11:06:50,Maybe miller has better speed and reach to effectively backtrack better than lindgreen so fox feels more comfortable pressing. Thats all i can think of.
rangers,lxroyz5,2024-11-18 10:36:44,I’d rather get both Mancini and Jones playing time while also getting Lindgren 100% healthy. Then you can really see what you have. And also look to the future
rangers,lxu6knn,2024-11-18 18:16:45,Sure but in this case he’s right on the money. Jones has deserved to be a full timer since last year. Also if Tony D wasn’t such a piece of shit I guarantee he would still be in the league somewhere.
rangers,lxu6ffi,2024-11-18 18:15:53,These numbers are only for this season where Fox has played the vast majority with Miller.
rangers,lxrtwap,2024-11-18 11:02:59,Lindgren was much much much worse
rangers,lxru9zk,2024-11-18 11:05:01,Lingren is by far the worst defenseman/player on the team.  Has been true for a while.  I would also argue that Miller was way better than Trouba last playoffs.
rangers,lxrr6kc,2024-11-18 10:48:35,Jones is our best LHD.
rangers,lxs75gw,2024-11-18 12:11:15,Biggest problem last spring was Trouba not Miller.
rangers,lxsvjx2,2024-11-18 14:13:27,Even if they didn’t want to take a vet out of the lineup Jones could have made more of an impact as a 7th D than giving Rempe 3 minutes a night.
rangers,lxroro1,2024-11-18 10:35:38,Wouldn’t it only help us to do that?
rangers,lxryxa5,2024-11-18 11:29:21,Yeah I had a similar thought. Lindgren is the more positionally sound player but Miller has the better tools in the toolbox. Miller is also better at walking the blue line and keeping plays alive in the offensive zone which helps Fox too.
rangers,lxrpgbf,2024-11-18 10:39:20,Mancini getting a full season in the ahl is a net positive here. We have him down he probably will get more games with rest/injuries. I’d like him to work on adding more offense to his game and really work on stretch passes.
rangers,lxsmff6,2024-11-18 13:27:49,If you’re looking to the future better to play Lindy with Trouba since they will probably both be gone next season after Igor gets his new contract.
rangers,lxu7o8r,2024-11-18 18:23:06,A broken clock I guess? Jones is good. The rest of his analysis lives in a vacuum of individual player impact to shots and not their team contribution. My favorite is his take that 93/55/8 on the ice is 0-14 in goals. Meanwhile 93/23/79 is almost exactly the same because Zibanejad is the black hole and the games he is looking at 23/55 were paired and 79/8 were paired. It’s cherry picking to drive the wrong narrative.Jones is good. Lindgren isn’t a top line defenseman. Miller is underdeveloped. And xGs don’t show up on the score sheet. Especially when Miller is more likely to screen Igor than block a shot leading to more of his xGA being converted to actual goals against. Or his turnovers leading to more opportunities against than he creates. He picks the weird obsessions when there is so much happening all around him.
rangers,lxrwu1b,2024-11-18 11:18:30,Miller and trouba just doesn't work.Without trouba miller is a great d man.Without miller trouba isn't that bad tbh. Not great but his injury slowed him down. Lindy is sad because the guy was the heart and soul of this teams defensive style in 22-23 but it's probably over for him.
rangers,lxt9qta,2024-11-18 15:25:26,Lindgren's ranks among 43 D men with at least 150:00 5v5 minutes in the playoffs last year:42% shot attempt differential: 41st    37% shot differential: 41st    39% scoring chance differential: 41st    32% high-danger chance differential: 43rd (dead last)    34% xGF%: 43rd (dead last)    he was statistically the worst defenseman in the playoffs last year and the only reason he was a -1 instead of significantly worse is because Igor had a 94% 5v5 save% with him on the ice and NYR was shooting 9.20% on the other end of the ice
rangers,lxse6hi,2024-11-18 12:46:25,Yup. Jones-Fox Miller-SchneiderLindgren-Trouba just eating minutes
rangers,lxs817n,2024-11-18 12:15:41,By far.
rangers,lxsifqw,2024-11-18 13:07:44,Both were at fault. Equally shit.
rangers,lxrq83c,2024-11-18 10:43:29,No. Unused cap space banks up over time as long as you are not using LTIR relief. It’s better to not have players on LTIR so that your extra cap space accrues over time. Then you’ll have more room at the deadline to make additions.
rangers,lxsid5p,2024-11-18 13:07:22,False. Miller paired with anyone. He’s still just straight up not good. Hockey IQ and brain is nil.
rangers,lxu8w9o,2024-11-18 18:30:10,I'm still pissed they wasted the run by not even trying Jones.
rangers,lxsnhm6,2024-11-18 13:33:07,Huh TIL. Thanks!
rangers,lxsm0ep,2024-11-18 13:25:44,False. Miller paired with Fox is straight up good. They complement each others' playing style very nicely.
rangers,lxu987d,2024-11-18 18:32:05,I've mentioned it a million times because it's worth mentioning over and over againNYR beat FLA 1 time in the regular season last year and it happened when neither Trouba nor Lindgren played but Jones did and Jones had a team best 70% xGF% and the primary assist on the GWG. But the team doesn't trust him because size even though he went up against FLA's big and gritty 4th line and totally eviscerated them
rangers,lxss57o,2024-11-18 13:56:24,Miller without fox looks like zadorov. With fox he looks like cale makar +4 inches in height and 50lbs of muscle.
rangers,lxsuj40,2024-11-18 14:08:21,Lol keep the blinders on it’s okay
rangers,lxrm1lc,2024-11-18 10:20:43,Personally no but I hope you enjoy! Here in ny the game is at 10pm on a Tuesday so you could image how that’ll go for us. Might have to call it a night after the first

rangers,lxpv83d,2024-11-18 01:14:02,It's actually insane what we are witnessing right now. Quick is an all-time legend.
rangers,lxqvtur,2024-11-18 07:30:23,Wish we'd had him in 2014. Especially since then the opposing net would be empty in the SCF.

rangers,lxru389,2024-11-18 11:04:01,I’m sure 1 at least. Quick isn’t 5hole Hank
rangers,lxsum0f,2024-11-18 14:08:45,Maybe with quick as the goalie back then and not handcuffed by hanks contract.  They could have added more scoring depth.

rangers,lxpss1a,2024-11-18 00:51:25,I was at the game tonight. Impressions:Panarin was easily the best player on the ice. World class. Dangerous on every shift. Fox is so smooth and smart. Rookies Jones and Edstrom looked great. D was strong overall aside from a few bad giveaways. Quick was perfect and looked it. Fun game to watch live. Climate Pledge Arena is awesome (but no MSG)
rangers,lxpifaf,2024-11-17 23:28:56,It’s 2024 Jonathan Quick is a Ranger and he has two straight shutouts. Try telling that to somebody ten years ago. You absolutely love to see it.
rangers,lxpnbfs,2024-11-18 00:05:18,I don't know who said what but it worked. Tonight's play style was the exact way the Panthers beat them last season. Unpredictable and heavy pressure in the offensive zone while the defensive team has control of the puck. Force mistakes and open up your own opportunities. I loved watching it. I've been waiting for it for so long
rangers,lxpr9nt,2024-11-18 00:38:04,While obviously not as good a skater and play driver I thought Johnny B played well slotting immediately into that 3C spot.  That line still did a lot of work
rangers,lxpvy2z,2024-11-18 01:20:47,Was at the game. Shout out to the fellow Ranger fans near section 6 chanting Let's go Rangers. We're louder than the Seattle fans
rangers,lxqufso,2024-11-18 07:19:02,Pretty wild that Quick has actually *lowered* his career GAA since joining the Rangers. He’s in his late 30s!
rangers,lxpnrb7,2024-11-18 00:08:48,mika's line is definitely starting to warm up. smith is actually becoming a bit of play driver and they'll see results 5v5 soon
rangers,lxpuipu,2024-11-18 01:07:23,Edstrom played great. Big man with wheels!!!
rangers,lxpicc1,2024-11-17 23:28:19,sam as soon as the buzzer goes off: SHUTOUT
rangers,lxpid36,2024-11-17 23:28:28,Actually a solid 60 mins for the bois tonight. Never doubted it Giannone!
rangers,lxpirjf,2024-11-17 23:31:27,Edstrom is such a weapon on the 4th line
rangers,lxpij5n,2024-11-17 23:29:44,Babe wake up Quick got another shutout
rangers,lxpizq1,2024-11-17 23:33:08,Definitely felt Chytil’s absence on that third line but a very solid performance by the guys all around.
rangers,lxpj6g5,2024-11-17 23:34:33,It's an absolute treat to get to witness a J Quick masterclass in goal. That's America's goalie.
rangers,lxpjfj6,2024-11-17 23:36:23,I have a pretty good feeling about this road trip. We’ll look back at it as the “turning point” of the season.
rangers,lxpk7kk,2024-11-17 23:41:53,Best Ranger skater tonight? Alexei Lafreniere gets my vote. Full skillset was on display to see. Kid is going places. It’s crazy how that line was able to flip momentum with some slick passing d and neutral zone passing time and again. Especially in the 2nd where the kraken were dominating
rangers,lxpkk1v,2024-11-17 23:44:23,I think Jones has used every hockey player cliche answer in that interview
rangers,lxplwta,2024-11-17 23:54:29,I want to win the cup just to see if Lavi might smile

rangers,lxpii07,2024-11-17 23:29:29,Jonathan Quick in 2011 form. What else can you ask for?I would say throw the bag at him when his contract is up but he’s so humble and loves being a Ranger that he wouldn’t even want that. The Rangers should keep re-signing him until he’s ready to hang his skates up. I don’t care if he plays until he’s 50. He’s amazing and deserves to retire a Ranger hopefully with another Cup or more. And I wish Laviolette would start playing the goalies as more of an equal tandem. At the very least Quick needs more starts. He’s proven himself to be the Greatest American Goalie Of All Time and hasn’t lost a step.
rangers,lxpighi,2024-11-17 23:29:11,jonathan quick just said “nuh-uh” to father time bro INSANE how hes still this good
rangers,lxpihpb,2024-11-17 23:29:25,I love playing the kraken. Entertaining team good speed usually not crazy or fight heavy but always good to watch and most of the time we beat them lmfao. Quickie shutout legend has been absolutely unreal Jones continuing to make Lavi look like an idiot for scratching him for so long. Still holding out and hoping for good news on chytil.
rangers,lxpiqq9,2024-11-17 23:31:17,Quick wants 400.
rangers,lxpiyb1,2024-11-17 23:32:51,When it is time for Quick to retire I would like to see him and Lundqvist together on the MSG Broadcast. Maybe John Giannone will be the color commentator by then and the Post Game Crew can be Valiquette Lundqvist and Quick. It would be a nice full circle moment from 2014.
rangers,lxpj3g2,2024-11-17 23:33:55,We played D tonight! Quick was great when he needed to be. Was sitting behind the net where the kraken shot twice and I think I saw Jones make the sickest outlet pass I’ve ever seen. Didn’t result in a goal but he’s out second best defenseman by a long shot right now.
rangers,lxplv5z,2024-11-17 23:54:08,Yo do JQ and Igor have a shot at the Jennings this year?
rangers,lxpljgj,2024-11-17 23:51:38,So I love Quick and what an honor to watch him play in personThat is all
rangers,lxpila2,2024-11-17 23:30:10,Nice to have a Jones on our team who knows how to score on Sundays!

rangers,lxpikfg,2024-11-17 23:29:59,Not a bad game from Mika. Felt like his line held serve throughout and they looked engaged. Bigger pictures I think this team can win with any of our dmen in isolation but we only have two dependable puck movers. We need one on each pair. Trouba Lindgren does not work. 
rangers,lxpj1ic,2024-11-17 23:33:31,We were defending! We were generating offense! Quickie was shutting them out! A little meh in the first half of the 2nd period but overall good.  So glad the lines were reunited! Good things happen.  This is what I want to see.  Great start to our road trip.  Keep it up! Onto Vancouver! See ya Tuesday!!
rangers,lxpja3j,2024-11-17 23:35:19,As good as the starting goalies have been the last few decades this org’s backups have been well above league average. Quick fantastic again. What a performance!

rangers,lxppows,2024-11-18 00:24:38,"A perfect start to the road trip. As the Rangers behind the 2nd straight shutout by the Greatest American Goalie Jonathan Quick blanked the Seattle Kraken 2-0. They played the Kraken Sam Carrick was Sam Krakenand Will Cuylle was smackin' with the hits. This episode of Rangers Hockey **Rangers After Dark:** ***Ranging the Sound*** the Rangers played Brought their Jam and got the win. And now the review of **Rangers After Dark.**1st Period: Lav said it during the postgame and that this game was a low shot type of game. Defensively the Rangers had some breakdowns but JQ was on his game. The pace to the game was good for both sides Brodz and Kakko almost had some shots. Rangers PK was them again. Sam called Sam Carrick ""Sam Kraken"" he got confused about who had the puck behind the net and Joe had some quotes that fit perfectly for **Rangers After Dark.** However the Rangers didn't have zone exits and breakouts in this period.2nd Period: Same thing happened again. Little to no breakouts and zone exits. However I did like the o zone time. 4th Line cooked tonight. Bread made some nice passes which eventually led to the Rangers GWG by Laf. What a fucking pass from Bread to Laf on the doorstep as the Rangers got the first goal. Key had also a great defensive recovery on Tanev and JQ decided to mount Tanev in the process. What?! It's **Rangers After Dark** crazy shit happens then. 3rd Period: Rangers got that o zone time going again. which eventually led to the 2nd goal by Zac Jones. A goal that sent this sub and the GT wild. A brilliant pass from Cuylle to Kakko and Zac Jones buried it backhand top shelf where mama hides the cookies. From there the Rangers were dialed in. O zone time was playing defense(by forechecking in the Kraken) zone. And besides that nothing came about after that. Oh Eddie had a power move. Overall Rangers played well. It was well executed game that the Rangers needed. Low shot game. Rangers Brought Jam and that's what was also necessary to win this one. Great Win! Onto the Canucks.Rangers Oppie just sent a late telegram only to say one thing ""Take in the Sheets. 2 points in the bag""Great win tonight. Onto the Canucks. God Save the King. Back afta dis."

rangers,lxpkv3o,2024-11-17 23:46:41,Quick for starter tbh
rangers,lxpk0dc,2024-11-17 23:40:25,We need to sign him long term immediately.
rangers,lxpj9jj,2024-11-17 23:35:12,This!!!!

rangers,lxrcwtr,2024-11-18 09:27:23,Cuylle Brodz Kakko was the best 3rd line we had last season
rangers,lxq0i1b,2024-11-18 02:05:28,I wonder if it could be heard through the broadcast. I was thinking whether I'm crazy hearing *let's go Rangers*
rangers,lxq5xvv,2024-11-18 03:03:23,I tried to be loud in 226.
rangers,lxq411j,2024-11-18 02:42:37,We were feeling pretty rowdy up in 204 as well! 
rangers,lxtn6ug,2024-11-18 16:33:07,My wife and I were all the way up at the top of 201. Somehow we were the most vocal people in the whole section despite a small smattering of Rangers fans there.Kudos to the Kraken fan couple seats to my left who actually bantered with me even while holding their baby. She helped make things fun when most others didn't want to chirp back.Also there was a young boy in front of me but couldn't hold back from yelling FUCK HIM UP TROCHECK during that small scrum he had. Sorry!
rangers,lxpqdk3,2024-11-18 00:30:27,Was at the game tonight and thought Mika looked good. Got a lot of tips in front of the net. Too bad none went in but he seemed to be in the right place most of the night.
rangers,lxpj04p,2024-11-17 23:33:13,Yup they moved the puck really well. russ passing and way better flow up and and down the ice You can not break up the French Bread Pizza line you just can’t
rangers,lxpmrru,2024-11-18 00:01:00,Holy shit that one shift late in the third period He nailed a massive hit (reverse hit? Couldn’t see) in the d zone and then takes the puck to the other side of the ice and creates danger this guy is amazing
rangers,lxplh0h,2024-11-17 23:51:06,Same lol
rangers,lxrur4r,2024-11-18 11:07:32,Brodzinski couldn't hold Chytil's jock strap. He will be ok for a few games or weeks but not long term. Get well Fil.
rangers,lxpm2kv,2024-11-17 23:55:40,I’m using that quote for my flair. He is America’s goalie.
rangers,lxpl1ik,2024-11-17 23:47:55,Just like last year! ( hopefully)
rangers,lxpore0,2024-11-18 00:16:54,Hehe he was top 5 for us tnZac was our best :) and Braden second
rangers,lxqoxv5,2024-11-18 06:30:13,Which ones
rangers,lxptqxl,2024-11-18 01:00:16,Do you think Zac Jones is going to go out to dinner with Daniel Jones?  I'll hang up and listen.
rangers,lxpq8y8,2024-11-18 00:29:22,He's probably a better QB
rangers,lxpjcwi,2024-11-17 23:35:54,same 
rangers,lxpkxu8,2024-11-17 23:47:13,I'm so glad I pulled the trigger on the Laf RR 2.0
rangers,lxpn953,2024-11-18 00:04:47,Igor was so happy and pretty on that bench  you don't see him half as content even after he gets the Broadway hat
rangers,lxpmzze,2024-11-18 00:02:47,And Tanev didn't mind that attention from Quickie 
rangers,lxplyus,2024-11-17 23:54:54,>Quick covering Tanev~~NSFW~~ nah It's **Rangers After Dark**
rangers,lxpkhtg,2024-11-17 23:43:56,Thank you!
rangers,lxpitq0,2024-11-17 23:31:54,Imagining it’s some type of magic where he gets better and better with age and we have a vezina 60 year old goaltender
rangers,lxqzctq,2024-11-18 07:57:24,The Jones thing is a big takeaway for me too. The way he’s playing makes our coaching staff look like complete dolts.
rangers,lxrzjor,2024-11-18 11:32:36,The only thing that could make sense on the Jones scratching is Drury trying to keep his next contract low. I don’t understand why they would ever scratch him otherwise
rangers,lxpkufg,2024-11-17 23:46:33,If he continues to roll at .973 or whatever save percentage he's going to have no trouble.
rangers,lxpkp9s,2024-11-17 23:45:29,goalie roundtable
rangers,lxpix0g,2024-11-17 23:32:35,Him and Schneider have been playing well.
rangers,lxpmjtw,2024-11-17 23:59:19,with no power plays they basically had no choice
rangers,lxpof2h,2024-11-18 00:14:07,Our 5v5 is rlly good this year (except on defense lol)
rangers,lxpk6pr,2024-11-17 23:41:42,Right?  Hard to believe
rangers,lxpjfbd,2024-11-17 23:36:21,I will never understand the appeal of American Football. Dull. As. Shit.
rangers,lxpjxbw,2024-11-17 23:39:48,with the current roster to get a puck mover on each pair requires putting an anchor on each pair and the opposition will just target that anchor on every entry/dump-in and wipe out the value of that puck moverthis is why 55/23 is a pair that's underwater even though the best defenseman in the league is on it
rangers,lxq1gp9,2024-11-18 02:15:26,Honestly how can anyone still hold a grudge against him? He is not the reason we lost that cup. Hank carried that team.
rangers,lxpk5v1,2024-11-17 23:41:32,If we win a cup yes
rangers,lxr5vmb,2024-11-18 08:42:37,100% - you can't hate him as a human being or as a goalie. Our defense lost us that cup.
rangers,lxplrs8,2024-11-17 23:53:26,Another banger
rangers,lxpq709,2024-11-18 00:28:54,Were u building SkyNet to take on our eventual AI overlords?  If so then u are excused.
rangers,lxpkz7z,2024-11-17 23:47:28,I love the kid but his blown empty net early in the first was horrific
rangers,lxpispy,2024-11-17 23:31:42,They're in 2nd place 2 goals behind Dallas.  I think they hovered around 1-5th for Jennings all last season too
rangers,lxpm5uf,2024-11-17 23:56:20,Quickie is old. You can't start him every game. He already did his share now he's the best backup ever but cannot be more
rangers,lxpn5vd,2024-11-18 00:04:04,Quick is 38. It's a marvel he can perform like this at his age but still.
rangers,lxplqly,2024-11-17 23:53:11,You’re being downvoted but this shouldn’t even be a hot take. He needs more starts. Igor while great in the playoffs is much more streaky than him in the regular season. If we’re talking solely regular season play he’s outplayed Igor since we signed him. Laviolette should be playing them more like an equal tandem. It’ll bring Igor’s next AAV down too.
rangers,lxpjwk9,2024-11-17 23:39:39,He was about to say something about Quick's shutout streak.
rangers,lxrae2i,2024-11-18 09:11:44,I will say this: I could hear it through the broadcast and the commentators said it was the kraken army lol

rangers,lxpnv91,2024-11-18 00:09:42,He usually gets it after being shelled for the entire game.
rangers,lxpnp9d,2024-11-18 00:08:21,Lindgren tried to hug Gourde in the first. Gourde didn’t seem to like it.
rangers,lxt15i1,2024-11-18 14:41:37,I get that and I get wanting to play the other guys but jones is one of our best performers right now and defense has been a huge struggle. I’m already thinking ahead to spring and the trade deadline and good defense is gonna be one of our biggest pieces.
rangers,lxpqpx2,2024-11-18 00:33:22,One of the best chances early was shorthanded too
rangers,lxpk2nd,2024-11-17 23:40:52,Completely propped up by gambling and fantasy the past few years. NHL seems to be thankfully growing finally
rangers,lxpjy1n,2024-11-17 23:39:56,TV timeouts with some football sprinkled in
rangers,lxptyhe,2024-11-18 01:02:11,Honestly today’s NFL is so hard to watch (especially as a giants fan). The amount of tv timeouts along with the amount of flags horrifically thrown that completely change the outcome of a game have turned me from someone that routinely watched football all day regardless of the teams to someone who doesn’t care if I miss the giants game.
rangers,lxpjwja,2024-11-17 23:39:38,I like it if I’m invested somehow or it’s a big CFB matchup also my family on both my parents sides are big football fans so I watched a ton growing up but the commercials are out of control for sure it makes it nearly unwatchablenot as bad as the last few min of an NBA game tho that I cannot handle
rangers,lxrmks4,2024-11-18 10:23:41,What i dont get is how baseball is seen as having no action when in actuality the ball is in play more than football.
rangers,lxpk3zn,2024-11-17 23:41:09,College football is a lot more interesting than the NFL
rangers,lxpwpi5,2024-11-18 01:28:01,The ageless wonder
rangers,lxpmcph,2024-11-17 23:57:47,Quickie is old. You can't start him every game. He already did his share now he's the best backup ever but cannot be more. He have cups and kids and age he needs to mind his health first.
rangers,lxpluh1,2024-11-17 23:54:00,That’s just gonna make him want to leave lol
rangers,lxqthsl,2024-11-18 07:11:05,Lol he sounds exactly like this.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itaP9\_Vltfk&ab\_channel=LetterkennyProblems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itaP9_Vltfk&ab_channel=LetterkennyProblems)
rangers,lxplxe8,2024-11-17 23:54:36,I still have a blank but waiting to see how Rempe works out lol
rangers,lxpo0wn,2024-11-18 00:10:58,Aye good point
rangers,lxplzh2,2024-11-17 23:55:01,Well then that’s really selfish and not showing consideration for the team or Quick. Quick is the Greatest American Goalie Of All Time and he shouldn’t take offense to Quick being treated with respect.
rangers,lxpm4h7,2024-11-17 23:56:03,The best goalie in the league leaving his team over splitting starts evenly with a 38 year old backup goalie (as good as that 38 year old backup goalie is) would not be selfish or weird in the slightest lol
rangers,lxpgu2a,2024-11-17 23:17:34,this kid is fast moves the puck up the ice alot like Anton Stralman
rangers,lxphfpi,2024-11-17 23:21:52,Love his game!!! What a difference a year makes

rangers,lxpvvg6,2024-11-18 01:20:05,Been saying for years that this kid is lefty version of Fox. baffles me that he hasnt been a regular in the lineup for longer
rangers,lxqkbh5,2024-11-18 05:43:19,What an outstanding play from zone to zone. Sick finish too.
rangers,lxpz4qp,2024-11-18 01:51:41,Thanks Grubauer lol

rangers,lxpvdvr,2024-11-18 01:15:31,It was great to see how happy he was on the bench after he scored. Definitely deserved it!
rangers,lxrpbvr,2024-11-18 10:38:40,Tbh he looked like our best defenseman last year down the stretch when he was in daily. He 100% should’ve been in for Miller during the playoffs. Miller was fucking horrific and Zac Jones was just WAY TOO GOOD for him not to even play one game. Lindy Trouba and Miller all could’ve been healthy scratched on any given day. Idgaf who you are come playoff time nobody should be safe. Jones in that lineup helps us win the Carolina series faster and probably helps us win at least 1 more game against Florida. That’s how good he was. That’s how bad miller was.
rangers,lxpkrif,2024-11-17 23:45:57,ZAC JONES! 631-330-8 zero zero fo

rangers,lxrugzb,2024-11-18 11:06:03,Miller is horrible! I call him Mr. Softie because he has yet to hit anyone with a body check in 3 years! Fighting! Never seen him get nasty ! He’s always a step behind the play ! Love Jones playing!!! Reminds me of Fox ! Knows when to get involved in the offense and passing skills off the charts

rangers,lxn5vk8,2024-11-17 15:08:15,Anyone stopping for drinks in Seattle before the game? My wife and I were thinking about either Buckley's in Belltown or just hitting up the Armory.
rangers,lxorabp,2024-11-17 20:32:47,will attempt to stay up for at least part of this one.  On another note Kracken is the coolest name for a hockey team and i love the whole creepy red eyed giant squid situation. Regardless..  LGR!
rangers,lxoszj3,2024-11-17 20:43:15,[Both Jake Leschyshyn and Jimmy Vesey are on the ice for warmups](https://x.com/MollieeWalkerr/status/1858322044338987104)Also it was overshadowed with other news yesterday: Lindgren is bubble free.
rangers,lxow0q9,2024-11-17 21:01:52,I want Henrik to help me navigate my whole life.
rangers,lxowjj6,2024-11-17 21:05:08,Mika Fox and Trocheck all benefited by the reunited lines. Feeling good about tonight. LGR

rangers,lxoyp50,2024-11-17 21:18:29,I was about to say I’m liking our defense right now.  Just keep it up 
rangers,lxoyrdm,2024-11-17 21:18:52,good pace so far.
rangers,lxoyyux,2024-11-17 21:20:11,We look good right now friends
rangers,lxoz3ll,2024-11-17 21:20:59,Poor Paco Taco. He is snakebitten.
rangers,lxozex1,2024-11-17 21:22:56,As much as we've sandbagged Lindgrens play since the injury we also have to remember that he's a solid if unexceptional top 4 D when healthy. If he's back to old Lindgren and Trouba doesn't implode we'd have a solid D corp. We already know Miller Fox is good.
rangers,lxoznih,2024-11-17 21:24:24,Much more pace and a good forecheck to start. One of the better starts to the season in those aspects.
rangers,lxp0akn,2024-11-17 21:28:24,Jesus Fucking Christ

rangers,lxp60ub,2024-11-17 22:04:14,Why did quick have to do all that by himself
rangers,lxp6k9u,2024-11-17 22:07:44,Rangers just can’t resist making a pass even when there are 5 Kraken surrounding the recipient
rangers,lxp6z9c,2024-11-17 22:10:24,JARNATHAN
rangers,lxp6zbf,2024-11-17 22:10:25,Thank god Lindgren was there to recover the fast break
rangers,lxp7366,2024-11-17 22:11:06,Need to do more than hope Trouba slaps go in... actually try to pry apart the Kraken defense else it's a night of frustration ahead.
rangers,lxp737k,2024-11-17 22:11:06,I’m just gonna assume it’s really hard to score if you have no shots on goal
rangers,lxp775s,2024-11-17 22:11:49,I hate that no look pass around the boards to no one that they constantly do
rangers,lxp88om,2024-11-17 22:18:35,the o zone time is good. however the zone exits/breakouts have been mia. gotta fix that
rangers,lxp8gts,2024-11-17 22:20:04,We’re playing this 2nd like we had the back-to-back instead.
rangers,lxp8iua,2024-11-17 22:20:26,Quick needs his ahh ate
rangers,lxp8jq0,2024-11-17 22:20:36,Not sure where we get a goal tonight outside of the Bread line or a greasy 4th line goal.
rangers,lxp8wlo,2024-11-17 22:22:58,we have to win this because my mom sent my dog treats and a festive how the grinch stole christmas bandana [(bad angle to see the bandana but cutest angle of my dog)](https://imgur.com/gallery/festivity-aIIsHqG)and it’s the first game we’ve watched with the bandana and I can’t have it end up being bad luck

rangers,lxpao2f,2024-11-17 22:34:41,Pay Quick $11.5m a year
rangers,lxpb6zh,2024-11-17 22:38:15,Kinda crazy that 16 games in Fox doesn't have a goal. Even crazier that 16 games in Kreider doesn't have an assist
rangers,lxpbjex,2024-11-17 22:40:37,also loved vinny on the goal.  first on the boards then creating havoc at net.  the latter made the pass a bit easier to land…

rangers,lxpihae,2024-11-17 23:29:20,Solid W .. that reminded me of how we played last November when I thought we were the most solid team in the league
rangers,lxp8ttm,2024-11-17 22:22:26,For fucks sake fellas.Stop with the fucking passes through traffic. They're not letting them through

rangers,lxnyl0g,2024-11-17 17:44:13,As a west coast fan Loving that I can watch every game this week at home not having to start and hide it at work. But as someone who lives in the Seattle region for hockey gonna need someone to point me in the right direction to sail the high seas.
rangers,lxo14es,2024-11-17 17:58:46,Kraken won 4 in a row damn

rangers,lxp1ycc,2024-11-17 21:38:44,Generally solid period defensively. I can easily see bread line producing something today. 
rangers,lxp23i4,2024-11-17 21:39:37,These guys need better and faster decision making with the puck especially with zone exits. Too many times they fail to clear because they were a second too slow/ late
rangers,lxp2ew1,2024-11-17 21:41:34,Nice paced 1st period.  Defense showed up. We had offense.  Got a little loosey goosey for a bit but overall solid and nice PK. Now let’s keep that up and have a goal producing 2nd.
rangers,lxp30vj,2024-11-17 21:45:20,Time for the Rangers to wake up and put a couple on the board.
rangers,lxp5kaw,2024-11-17 22:01:16,Broadcast looks a little dark
rangers,lxp5zyf,2024-11-17 22:04:05,This team needs to help Quick out and get some offense going
rangers,lxp64s0,2024-11-17 22:04:56,Thank you quick!
rangers,lxp68cx,2024-11-17 22:05:35,This is Seattle's backup goalie?
rangers,lxp6kog,2024-11-17 22:07:49,4th line cooks
rangers,lxp6nse,2024-11-17 22:08:22,Rough when the best offense is generated by the 4th line. Give them more TOI please
rangers,lxp6vvc,2024-11-17 22:09:48,Been happy with Vesey play since his return.
rangers,lxp7yro,2024-11-17 22:16:49,They are running us ragged.
rangers,lxp80nq,2024-11-17 22:17:09,We need some more special teams so we can do what we do best

rangers,lxp9otq,2024-11-17 22:28:07,I didn’t think it was possible tonight. I’m being serious lol
rangers,lxp9s9x,2024-11-17 22:28:45,Now get one more so quick can stop having heart attack saves back there
rangers,lxpa59m,2024-11-17 22:31:10,Hard plays look easy and easy plays look hard. Really hope miller can dial in because we need him to get the cup
rangers,lxpaild,2024-11-17 22:33:39,Seen enough just give the first star to Quick during this intermission 
rangers,lxpb8er,2024-11-17 22:38:32,Seriously what would it take to get Yanni Gourde or possibly Daniel Sprong to be on the Rangers come trade deadline?
rangers,lxpco2r,2024-11-17 22:48:15,tro mobbing that guy in front of the net on the laf goal rules he deserves an assist
rangers,lxpczjr,2024-11-17 22:50:27,Being Patient and having longer shifts in this period. I agree with Vally and Hank on that. For the Final 20 the Rangers need to force the Kraken to blow their coverage in the o zone. JQ is dialed in. However what I want to see for the Rangers is simple better zone exits/breakouts. They need to do that. But more importantly put the Kraken away here. If the Rangers can play smart here in the final 20 especially in the d zone and also have good crisp passing in the o zone to tire out the Kraken good things will happen. Backcheck Forecheck Trocheck.
rangers,lxpdi3y,2024-11-17 22:54:01,excellent shift indeed joe
rangers,lxpdvvm,2024-11-17 22:56:39,Jones! what a beast
rangers,lxpflro,2024-11-17 23:08:47,I don’t think it’s even a question that we got the two most frustrating goalies to play against.
rangers,lxpfzpk,2024-11-17 23:11:34,Stan Fischler with a 3am tweet is a hard lock
rangers,lxph90t,2024-11-17 23:20:35,Ooh EN! Let’s go
rangers,lxphfbg,2024-11-17 23:21:48,get kakko the puck (I’d say quick but I don’t want igor to be hella bummed lol)
rangers,lxphkj1,2024-11-17 23:22:48,We are willing to ice the puck when breaking out for 58 mins then everyone is scared to take the shot with the goalie pulled don't get it
rangers,lxpi4sr,2024-11-17 23:26:48,Good W
rangers,lxpk7wb,2024-11-17 23:41:57,Rangers have had the best backup goalies in the last 10+ years Quickie Raanta Biron Talbot and Georgiev.
rangers,lxp6gqu,2024-11-17 22:07:07,Edstrom is the shohei ohtani of 4th line wingers
rangers,lxpb2gp,2024-11-17 22:37:23,Laf is the next captain.
rangers,lxp8fsx,2024-11-17 22:19:53,If I had a dollar for every time Joe called them out for overpassing I’d have a lot of dollars.
rangers,lxpgfjm,2024-11-17 23:14:44,holy shit that pass by Jones to lead Edstrom on a breakawaythe whole game is zone exitsfail them and you're screwed convert on them and you create offense
rangers,lxpfk8z,2024-11-17 23:08:29,Quick is unbelievable … nights like these just reinforce how much I don’t want to pay Igor 12ish over 8.
rangers,lxoicw2,2024-11-17 19:38:44,After my escapades last night I’d be surprised if I make it through the first period. Nevertheless LFGR
rangers,lxoqwx4,2024-11-17 20:30:31,Love these late games. They make my night at work feel shorter.
rangers,lxoum7j,2024-11-17 20:53:14,laf better be on fuckin pp1 so help me god
rangers,lxouof7,2024-11-17 20:53:37,I got a massage earlier this evening I feel great (altho very sleepy and might not make it long into the game) and I just really hope the rangers don’t undo my relaxed vibes it was expensive
rangers,lxovct9,2024-11-17 20:57:47,Let's hope this trip gets them going like it did for them last year.
rangers,lxow3w2,2024-11-17 21:02:25,I forgot about that road trip last year that absolutely ruled and was worth the gamble do I stay up late every game
rangers,lxowitr,2024-11-17 21:05:01,seattle jerseys/overall color scheme one of my favorites in the league an expansion team done right (cough cough looking at you vegas and those chrome gold helmet options)
rangers,lxox06g,2024-11-17 21:07:59,Still so sad about Fil. Will be until he •hopefully• returns
rangers,lxoy8g5,2024-11-17 21:15:38,i thought kakko scored
rangers,lxoyf45,2024-11-17 21:16:45,Not gonna lie Lindgren looks like he has a little more zip since getting his cage taken off. Hopefully he's healed enough to go back to eating solid foods and can breathe again.
rangers,lxoyfb6,2024-11-17 21:16:47,Yes Sam.  Very good pace
rangers,lxoz3mc,2024-11-17 21:20:59,I'm gonna be furious if they show the replay and that was on
rangers,lxoznw2,2024-11-17 21:24:28,For those MSG access challenged trivia QWho was the first Ranger to score 40 goals in a season?
rangers,lxozy40,2024-11-17 21:26:12,Is this camera guy drunk?

rangers,lxp297l,2024-11-17 21:40:35,Jonathan Quick should play more. Bro has 3 Stanley cups.
rangers,lxp2a0f,2024-11-17 21:40:44,Need to really quit it with launching the puck into the air in a poor excuse for a zone exit... just ends up on the stick of the other team and back into their zone again.
rangers,lxp2ab4,2024-11-17 21:40:47,I know nothing about hockey fundamentals/skills/etc. but it seems like brodz has a really good shot. like better than most 3rd liners ive seen
rangers,lxp2j7l,2024-11-17 21:42:19,Thought the game was at 10pm seems I didn't miss much other than Quick.
rangers,lxp69l6,2024-11-17 22:05:48,Let’s get something going here.
rangers,lxp6abz,2024-11-17 22:05:56,3 on 3 across the blue line Jones' gap control forces the puck into the half wall and Seattle throws it out of their own zonethat is defense
rangers,lxp6si2,2024-11-17 22:09:13,That picture lol
rangers,lxp6t0j,2024-11-17 22:09:19,The 4th line doing well as usual.
rangers,lxp70m5,2024-11-17 22:10:39,Still no SOG for us? Darn I thought we had 1. Thank goodness for Quick.
rangers,lxp7e9w,2024-11-17 22:13:07,Not liking the vibe although I do like us playing more physical
rangers,lxp7ezw,2024-11-17 22:13:15,small play but Carrick icing that puck when he was standing right by the red line was quite badhope it doesn't bite them on this ensuing faceoff
rangers,lxp7u6k,2024-11-17 22:16:00,It's amazing how our 3rd and 4th line are more consistent and better in both ends than our supposed first line
rangers,lxp8lfa,2024-11-17 22:20:55,Quickie! 
rangers,lxp8n64,2024-11-17 22:21:13,Quick has been unreal this year

rangers,lxpa9cj,2024-11-17 22:31:56,Jones/Schneider btw now have a 7-1 5v5 goal differential in under 90 min of 5v5 TOIthat is absolutely ridiculous. sustainable? no. but they have a 63% xGF% and they're deserving of being on the plus side
rangers,lxp5v0f,2024-11-17 22:03:12,I think we left our O in the locker room
rangers,lxpihtr,2024-11-17 23:29:27,do the rangers have a starting goalie controversy?
rangers,lxp0zjy,2024-11-17 21:32:45,I am so tired of Miller. Yea I know we all like to complain about Trouba and Lindy but Miller is just so fucking bad way too fucking often.

rangers,lxp0mqm,2024-11-17 21:30:30,They signed a 30 year old Chandler Stephenson to a 7 year deal??
rangers,lxp5a0b,2024-11-17 21:59:27,Schneider breaks his stick on the attempted zone exit and Seattle immediately turns that into the most dangerous chance of the gamenot his fault at all but that's how quickly things can hit the fan when you fail zone exits
rangers,lxpbft1,2024-11-17 22:39:55,With Chytil out Quick is the best player on the roster by a country mile. We are lucky to have him.

rangers,lxofnos,2024-11-17 19:23:19,Bit worried about this one. All stats show rangers should win but they have gotten used to playing the bottom teams and got beat by the last good team. Idk
rangers,lxos3wj,2024-11-17 20:37:50,Watched the Kraken play the Islanders last night (on MSG) what I noticed is that the Kraken will have net front presence in front of the goal especially Yanni Gourde a guy who I think the Rangers should actively look into trading for. that's my pre game take right now.
rangers,lxos7vo,2024-11-17 20:38:29,is this the first time this season they've all been in the studio together instead of in different places?

rangers,lxmik4k,2024-11-17 13:04:19,I want to see them tighten up defensively and play with more physicality. They play like something is missing some strength of leadership some inner drive. Something is not quite right. We are not even one-fifth of the way into the schedule so there is loads of time to work it out but a more up tempo performace would be a good start.
rangers,lxp1tjc,2024-11-17 21:37:56,Just wait until he talks about the soft hands on the shaft

rangers,lxphw79,2024-11-17 23:25:07,If Quick can win a Stanley Cup with the Rangers 1. How many goalies or players in general have won 3 on 3 different teams?2. Does that make him the best goalie ever?

rangers,lxoawex,2024-11-17 18:55:59,This is great optimism! I've been grumbling annoyed the game will be starting when I'm usually in bed.
rangers,lxole6s,2024-11-17 19:56:50,Was bummed about the late start but this perspective is refreshing. Although I usually watch their games with my 13yo I'm looking forward to a night alone in bed watching them uninterrupted while the kids are at their Mom's place

rangers,lxpc2np,2024-11-17 22:44:11,well when he called out DeAngelo in the MSG 150 that was one of the most brutal snarks he pulled off
rangers,lxn5tw6,2024-11-17 15:07:59,Should have been a two minute minor for delay of game for the Kraken.

rangers,lxozx2w,2024-11-17 21:26:01,To be fair feels like first time in a while they haven't conceded a goal in the first minute of play...

rangers,lxph7tq,2024-11-17 23:20:20,Yes
rangers,lxph8aa,2024-11-17 23:20:26,Yes
rangers,lxpf5dh,2024-11-17 23:05:30,He just needed to make Chytil a blood sacrifice.
rangers,lxp5t11,2024-11-17 22:02:50,I think it’s just Seattles arena tbh. They’re always having lighting issues
rangers,lxp8506,2024-11-17 22:17:56,Yeah and they played yesterday.  kraken should be getting tired not playing better
rangers,lxoyelz,2024-11-17 21:16:40,Hockey gods are still against him
rangers,lxp2j7w,2024-11-17 21:42:19,he's also nearly 40. sure he's playing well but he's playing well in a low-volume of games
rangers,lxp2kuw,2024-11-17 21:42:35,He’s also 38.
rangers,lxp41dd,2024-11-17 21:51:34,Johnny Broadsides is good at hockey and the fact that he isn't a mainstay on this team is a crime
rangers,lxpedh1,2024-11-17 23:00:07,pizza
rangers,lxpf69k,2024-11-17 23:05:41,Definitely Quick but I won't say it until the game is over
rangers,lxpf9g5,2024-11-17 23:06:19,Quick deserves it more but I think he had it in the last game he played so Jones.
rangers,lxpybzi,2024-11-18 01:43:48,quick is 38it's reasonable to assume that he would start to break down with a more stressful workload
rangers,lxpjroe,2024-11-17 23:38:43,Well w/ 2 straight shutouts I'd give Quickie at least another start on this trip even tho there are no back to back games.
rangers,lxp1dzk,2024-11-17 21:35:15,He makes simple plays look hard and hard plays look easy 
rangers,lxp12rm,2024-11-17 21:33:19,I mean the Preds gave Stamkos and Marchessault lots of money and years. and look at how that's panned out so far.
rangers,lxn9jzo,2024-11-17 15:28:02,Hopefully it’s nothing too major. I just hope we don’t get a report like the Penguins yesterday:>Coach Sullivan confirms that Kris Letang will not play tonight (illness) and the remainder of the roster is a game-time decision.

rangers,lxo00pj,2024-11-17 17:52:24,yup because we have been getting the number 1 then they get the back up they are paper tigers
rangers,lxmc3mg,2024-11-17 12:28:42,Its more theyve had a normal schedule and back to back nights since returning than the 2 game global series. They had their home opener the day after our season opener.
rangers,lxmbs5i,2024-11-17 12:26:54,That was 2 games
rangers,lxnaoc3,2024-11-17 15:34:09,I hope so too. Being forced to ride across Canada while feeling sick is one of the definitions of hell known to men.

rangers,lxmcanc,2024-11-17 12:29:47,See ya at CPA fellow Rangers fans in Seattle! Wonder if it's Igor or Quick tonight? Hoping it's a game as good as or better than last year's. Except without Buoy distracting me from the go ahead Rangers goal...
rangers,lxmeh0z,2024-11-17 12:41:52,YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I'M AWAKE BUT I WILL SOON BE TAKING A NAP TO PREPARE FOR THIS GAME! Im here. But this game might be something great. So. On this episode of Rangers Hockey Season 99 Episode 16 and the season premier of **Rangers After Dark:** ***Ranging the Sound.*** As our heroes head to the Pacific Northwest and take on the Kraken team. Who have won four in a row but they have been streaky. Now I did watch their game yesterday against the Islanders. While yes its the Islanders but I noticed one thing that could be a problem for the Rangers and that is net front battles. Which now leads to my question I ask and that is What Will the Rangers do in this game? Well as I stated the Rangers need to protect the blue paint area. Two of the Kraken's goals (although the gwg in the game last night was sus) were net front battles. the Rangers need to that. Especially watch out for Yanni Gourde a guy who I think(should Chytil be out for a long period and the Kraken fall out of the playoff race) should look into trading for. Rangers need to win the battles on the defensive zone and o zone as well. Next try not to turn this game into a run and gun type of game aka Instagram Hockey. Kraken did that last night. Rangers need to not make it a game like that spend more time in the o zone. Rangers did that against the Sharks the need to continue to play smart with the puck as well. And finally THE MOST important one and that is PLAY A 60 MINUTE GAME OF HOCKEY. Start on time the Rangers gave up the first goal in their past few games. The need to get the first one in this game to set the tone.My Spidey Senses are tingling that Kreids will use his net front presence to get a goal in his office. Kakko will get one just like the last time these two teams met in Seattle(which also caused the building lights to go out). He will get a goal for The Fun Line as well as for Fil. Fox will bake some apples. And finally a fourth line goal will get one. Probably That Sick Individual.A late night game folks. Be ready for it. It's gonna be a road trip. 2 points on the line here. Bring those positive vibes.Bring some Jamlgr
rangers,lxnehzc,2024-11-17 15:54:22,As a west coast fan I love these game times.

rangers,lxmlmef,2024-11-17 13:20:46,I'm not sure if you ever heard of the NFL. But that may have something to do with it.
rangers,lxmwrkn,2024-11-17 14:18:50,Tbh a 9pm EST start *is* early. 10 and 10:30 pm EST used to be the standard west coast start times.
rangers,lxmtigl,2024-11-17 14:01:54,If you're planning on taking public transit get the Kraken/CPA app. You can link your ticketmaster account and get a free transit pass. I just found out about this when I went to the Blackhawks/Kraken game
rangers,lxp08k1,2024-11-17 21:28:02,No the nhl is run by fucking morons and the schedule is shit every year. How many games were on election day and they were the only league playing. How bout those stupid staggered start times with every team playing what was that on a Tuesday. And what was it like 3 weeks ago half the teams played at like 1pm on a Sunday. So no I do not think the nhl is cognisent of anything the NFL does
rangers,lxmprgz,2024-11-17 13:42:23,It wouldn’t matter
rangers,lxmt8q1,2024-11-17 14:00:30,The Seahawks play at 1 and who cares about the Giants. The game could start at 4
rangers,lxmzr5x,2024-11-17 14:34:47,Just blows my mind why you wouldn’t do a 5 o’clock start on weekend on west coast 8 here and than you get good ratings for both teams . Like I would never understand why they wouldn’t wanna peek viewer ship
rangers,lxmtqd1,2024-11-17 14:03:03,Thank you but I fortunately live walking distance to the Seattle Center area. This is definitely still a great tip!
rangers,lxpbu4o,2024-11-17 22:42:36,Giants are on BYE
rangers,lxsbocl,2024-11-18 12:33:58,Ratings aren’t really a thing anymore NHL viewership has been declining ticket sales have been declining but they’re boasting record profits. Thats from sponsors advertisers I’m sure it helps when you have guys like Bill Foley and Vince Viola in a super PAC funneling money into their rich friends and vice versa
rangers,lxpc3eo,2024-11-17 22:44:19,An even better reason to start the game early
rangers,lxt431y,2024-11-18 14:56:25,I mean look at the prices of a ticket forMSG compare to five years ago .. it’s easy to post record profits when your going up 100 a year on tickets

rangers,lxlacv9,2024-11-17 08:42:34,I liked Pirozhky Pirozhky and Pike’s Place Chowder last time I was there. The seafood is legit in town ↕
rangers,lxlnd5v,2024-11-17 10:09:13,While you're at Pike Place hit up Mee Sum Pastry. they have some of the best hum bao I've ever had in my life. Go to Volunteer Park and check out Bruce and Brandon Lee's grave site. There a bar on Capitol Hill called The Pine Box it used to be a funeral home and Bruce Lee's funeral was held there. There's also Discovery Park there's a couple of different trails you can take but I usually just do the loop and take a break at the bluffs overlooking the Puget Sound. As others have said Dicks Burgers is a must. Make sure you have a Rainier while you're in town.Edit: Take the Monorail from Westlake station to CPA. Its free with your ticket. Its a short ride but how often do you get to ride a monorail from The World's Fair?Edit 2: KEXP the greatest radio station in the world is based in Seattle Center right next to Climate Pledge.

rangers,lxoudyw,2024-11-17 20:51:51,Seconding this. I also really enjoyed visiting gasworks park when I lived there although mainly on gorgeous summer days that’s when it really shines with everyone flying kites and people doing stuff out on the lake

rangers,lxk2ml9,2024-11-17 01:25:17,Put him on PP1 circle high. We've obviously been misusing him
rangers,lxoa84y,2024-11-17 18:52:02,That's a good shot he needs to work on certain aspects but if he was given an actual shot I think he can be a solid bottom six guy

rangers,lxocji1,2024-11-17 19:05:28,He’s also become effective on the PK. He’s generating some good scoring chances short handed.
rangers,lxkxzn5,2024-11-17 06:59:36,I don't watch AHL games and perhaps the stats are deceiving but he has 2 points in 7 games there and is a minus 5. Those numbers don't suggest he'd be helpful in the NHL.Nice snipe though don't expect a goal like that from him when I clicked on the clip.

devils,lxtwp2u,2024-11-18 17:22:15,Feels like it’s now or never for Foote. He’s healthy he’s had time to marinate a bit and now he gets the opportunity for regular playing time in a non-Lindy system where his below average foot speed shouldn’t hurt him as much (theoretically). If he’s ever going to make an impact with the big club the time is now.
devils,lxtx5fu,2024-11-18 17:24:41,Lazar going on IR instead of LTIR is hopefully a sign that he’s not as far away as it’s been discussed. With us now going into LTIR with Nate it’s no longer about saving money for the Cap.
devils,lxtwipw,2024-11-18 17:21:18,So much for hoping Bastian would make a comeback after this breakTop Cop Shane Bowers is on the case
devils,lxtytt0,2024-11-18 17:33:41,I like them giving Foote a shot but why call up Bowers? What am I missing with this guy? He was a 1st rd pick in 2017 and has never put up any numbers in the AHL and even when he has gotten a few NHL games he's really shown nothing. I'd rather see Halonen at this point.
devils,lxtxh7f,2024-11-18 17:26:26,Excited to see if Foote can stick still feel he can be a good 4th liner if he can stay healthy 
devils,lxtzgta,2024-11-18 17:37:08,Wow Bastian on LTIR I thought he would be back sooner than Lazar.
devils,lxu5xya,2024-11-18 18:13:05,The IR situation is the complete reverse of what I’d thought would happen. Wasn’t it reported that Lazar’s injury could take a couple months to recover while Bastian’s timeline was a couple weeks?
devils,lxu6eat,2024-11-18 18:15:42,Bastian being put on LTIR can be retroactive to the game he went out in Calgary. So I think it’s been 8 games since then so technically he could still come back as soon as the next two games are played.
devils,lxtxp69,2024-11-18 17:27:36,I know it’s not a lot of ltir space but I hope Fitz can make some magic out of the negative here

devils,lxu59wk,2024-11-18 18:09:15,Because he's better than both Mac and Dowling and we're trying to win hockey games.  If Bastian's out for awhile we want the best guys we can have filling in our roster.
devils,lxu5jt1,2024-11-18 18:10:51,Could potentially be a move to get him tape for a potential trade

devils,lxt4872,2024-11-18 14:57:10,It's pretty clear that Keefe wanted the team to lock down their defensive play before changing anything else. Now that there's some coherence in the d-zone I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing a little more neutral zone offensive plays.
devils,lxt0x73,2024-11-18 14:40:27,I like the thought process. We have players that can turn it on.
devils,lxt5got,2024-11-18 15:03:23,"You mean Lindy's system of ""expect everyone to make high end plays while leaving the goalie twisting in the wind and be surprised when trying to force offense results in defensive breakdowns"" was the problem the whole time and we're better off running a simpler game that allows offense to develop naturally? I'm shocked I tell you. Shocked"
devils,lxt1138,2024-11-18 14:41:00,New coach. Surprised something change.
devils,lxtve5b,2024-11-18 17:15:15,Recall that the magical 2012 run the Devils were a terrific forechecking team that was able to play fast with Parise Kovy Elias Henrique etc. That team was also very solid in their own zone as well
devils,lxt8mu0,2024-11-18 15:19:46,Copy the rest of it for us non-Twitter users?
devils,lxu6caf,2024-11-18 18:15:23,That observation is very noticeable. There's way less cuteness with the puck trying to enter the zone. That was a huge problem last year

devils,lxt565q,2024-11-18 15:01:54,At the same time an offensive strategy of let Jack be Jack isn't a terrible idea.
devils,lxt5sfr,2024-11-18 15:05:04,It also helps that Luke has turned into an absolute monster on defense. It must be a Hughes thing for them to come out swinging their 3rd year. I remember Jack was hit or miss those first few years and then he got into his point per game ways during his 3rd year.
devils,lxtlz1d,2024-11-18 16:26:58,Trend as most teams approach the 20 game mark...Teams are dumping pucks in at a higher rate than the past couple of seasons. Copycat league and the defending champs are a test case for overhauling a rush based offensive approach to one more focused on puck management from 2022 - 2024.Only 3 teams have a higher dump-in rate at 5v5 this season than they did last season (NYI SEA DET). Every other team is dumping it in on a higher percentage of their entries. Median dump-in rate this season is 53.1% compared to 50.5% last season and 50.0% the season before that. The Devils are an interesting case. Similar rush based attack the last couple of years that Florida had in 2021-22 when the Panthers won 58 games and lost in the 2nd round.....Devils are dumping it in on 55% of their entries this season up 10 percentage points from 45% last season (2nd biggest shift of any team). It has taken some rush offense away as the Devils are averaging fewer rush chances per 60 at 5v5. However they are also allowing less. Less risk in the neutral zone theoretically = less quick-strike against. The Devils rank 7th in turnover rate (turnovers relative to possessions) in the neutral zone compared to 27th last season.In the end differentials are what matter and NJ has found other ways to score at 5v5 leading the league in goals via forecheck with 11. It also has the best goal differential in that area at +9.The roster composition of each team is different and there is no one-size-fits-all but there has been a noticeable increase in dump-ins so far this season. There are other teams trying to make similar adjustments early this season with less than positive results. It took the Panthers close to a year to execute a different style of play that ultimately helped them get to back-to-back Cup Finals. The Devils will be an interesting team to follow in terms of these types of trends.
devils,lxtba4q,2024-11-18 15:33:15,We should encourage bluesky content
devils,lxtcfg8,2024-11-18 15:39:04,To be fair our goalie tandem couldn’t stop a muffin last couple of years. The skaters weren’t doing them many favors but they also weren’t doing themselves any favors.
devils,lxt7xuc,2024-11-18 15:16:10,It's tricky. Jack has played better defense in the last 10 games than he has in the last 5 seasons combined and is now starting to rack up some serious points. While we've all seen the (almost) unearned success from the pond hockey mentality I think allowing that style of play again will create some stagnation for the rest of the team in the long term.
devils,lxtdxb9,2024-11-18 15:46:36,Love how 2 weeks ago this sub wanted to send Luke to Utica for more work.
devils,lxt8024,2024-11-18 15:16:29,>It also helps that Luke has turned into an absolute monster on defense.Couldnt have anything to do with a new coach or chanfes tp the defensive system.
devils,lxtd9iw,2024-11-18 15:43:16,Last year not couple of years. It was last year only that they struggled. VV and Akira were part of the best regulation record in NJD history in 22-23 VV .911%...Akira .922%.
devils,lxty3g0,2024-11-18 17:29:44,They weren't anything special maybe but if we did that to Marky he'd lose too imho.
devils,lxt9cxc,2024-11-18 15:23:26,Don’t get me wrong Keefe definitely unlocked something with the defense because he simplified the offense and there is less pressure on the defense to pick up the slack. But Luke had a crazy close out on an opposing forward the other night beating him to a puck that he had no business getting to. Thats what I mean by him becoming a monster.
devils,lxtdi7d,2024-11-18 15:44:29,I’ve been saying this for the last couple of seasons. Luke has been doing the whole winning puck races he has no business even being in thing pretty consistently the last 2 years. His main weaknesses were always getting used to NHL speed forechecks and his size. After 2 years he’s making a lot better and quicker decisions. That and also not many defensemen make it to the big leagues before they’re 22 - and just like Jack it was going to take a couple of years for him to grow. He’s the biggest of the three brothers and arguably has the highest skill ceiling of the three. Just wait another 2-3 years and he’ll be running the league like Quinn or Makar better than fox or heiskanen.
devils,lxr9tc6,2024-11-18 09:08:02,Do you believe this devils squad is a true cup contender this season?
devils,lxu91pq,2024-11-18 18:31:03,Boy it sure would be cool if the Caps could lose a game. Like ever. Like I don’t know maybe tonight.
devils,lxsdaf6,2024-11-18 12:42:01,A true playoff team yes. Contender? We will have a better answer by the trade deadline. We sure looked like it vs Florida. Not so much vs Tampa.
devils,lxronsf,2024-11-18 10:35:03,Cup is questionable still. Playoffs most definitely.
devils,lxrslyb,2024-11-18 10:56:09,My expectations for this season are playoffs and hopefully win a round. Not making the playoffs would be a gigantic disappointment. Losing in the 1st round would stink but I’d get over it considering they didn’t even make the playoffs last year. If they win a round I’m happy even if they lose the next and anything past the 2nd round I would be thrilled.
devils,lxsajwj,2024-11-18 12:28:20,Depends on your definition of cup contender. I think the canes panthers and rangers are in a higher tier than us. All those teams have been more consistently good both this year and the last few seasons. Other than them I do see us as in the same tier as Washington Toronto Tampa Boston. I don’t think that’s disrespecting us I just think it’s all really even right now. That 8 is a decent step above the other half of the East though.
devils,lxrasbv,2024-11-18 09:14:12,There’s a couple aspects of our game that need work still but once those are fixed (and I believe they will be) yes.
devils,lxrt81z,2024-11-18 10:59:24,It's a real good team but the Canes Caps and Rags are all going to be problems.
devils,lxsejlj,2024-11-18 12:48:13,Win a playoff series this year depending on opponent cup appearance within Markstrom’s contract. Palat coming off the books and allowing a pure goal scorer into the top 6 will be the final piece
devils,lxrjx36,2024-11-18 10:08:43,My only hopes and expectations are to be competitive. Not counting this season the team's been very bad for a long time except for 2 years. We don't need to make that kind of jump so soonThey've more or less got me believing again but I think there's too much inconsistency to be a true contender at this point in time
devils,lxp8wuc,2024-11-17 22:23:01,Vasilevskiy
devils,lxpddx2,2024-11-17 22:53:13,I mean for most of that time tampa has been good and the devils have been bad our record against most teams the last 10 years is probably not great
devils,lxpec0o,2024-11-17 22:59:50,One of those 8 losses they have was my bachelor party in 2018 where we beat them 2-1 at home. I was so pumped after the second Devils goal that I put the bucket of chicken tenders fries and ketchup on my head to celebrate. A little premature as Tampa scored in the 3rd but still…I would gladly do that again sober due to this insane record they have against us.
devils,lxpkkpq,2024-11-17 23:44:31,One thing that stood out to me yesterday - even my wife commented on I - is how TB just relentlessly executes. Their players are always where they're supposed to be they find the open man and they make good clean passes. Edmonton did that as well.It's a level of play that we have to get to in order to be a real contender.
devils,lxpdip1,2024-11-17 22:54:08,Tampa - 2 games in last 9 daysDevils - last game in a brutal road tripThis is a schedule loss. They caught us in a vulnerable spot while well rested. Don’t forget we put five up on them last time we met. We’re closer than you think
devils,lxpezme,2024-11-17 23:04:22,You have arguably the best goalie in the world on a team that is fundamentally designed to highlight one of the best wingers in the world. People that thought that Tampa was going to take a step back because they got rid of Stamkos and Sergachev were delusional. Guentzel is a clear upgrade to Stamkos who last year got most of his points on the power play.
devils,lxqqsck,2024-11-18 06:47:18,I mean we sucked for most of that time. This last game the devils looked like a team that played 5 games in 7 days and Tampa played 2 games in 9 days
devils,lxsmzv3,2024-11-18 13:30:39,I’ve noticed for years that Tampa is incredibly adept at smothering offense in their defensive zone. Part of it is pushing the limits of what could almost be called interference particularly on squashing zone entries.  It’s a specific piece of a very well coached team. I hate it but they are really good at slowing down the game in their zone and gaining control.
devils,lxpf76r,2024-11-17 23:05:52,You can ask the Same Question about the CapsCanes and many more. Its Hockey nothing gonna be easy. Just like you we have no clue why they have a hard time with certain teams.
devils,lxqwyda,2024-11-18 07:39:19,Tampa is a well coached veteran team and as others have said the Devils have not had success against a bunch of teams because they’ve had many losing seasons. If they establish themselves as a winning team with a winning culture that should start to change.
devils,lxr7hpn,2024-11-18 08:53:07,It’s tough to garage fully because for a large stretch of the last decade the devils have been very bad while Tampa has been very good. 4-0 is tough but context helps. We’ve had the worst schedule in the NHL while Tampa was coming off a better rest than us. They have a world clsss goaltender too which covers a lot of gaps in the team. Look at the rags and Igor as he steals tons of games for them every season.Tampa is a well coached team that’s been well coached and together for a long time. Those guys play as a unit and the devils are still learning how to do just that constantly
devils,lxs6lff,2024-11-18 12:08:24,Vassilevsky tough to beat.   They have two cups and one final.  We have one playoff win in a decade.
devils,lxq2vp1,2024-11-18 02:30:21,I see it as they are experienced enough to not fall for the head fakes and jokes we rely on at times to get by teams.They have the skill and experience and also vasilevskiy
devils,lxpefre,2024-11-17 23:00:33,and Kuch and Hedman but mostly Vasi
devils,lxs73jb,2024-11-18 12:10:59,Sure Tampa has been a great team.   But even mediocre teams like the Islanders and Capitals always seem to give the Devils fits and good or bad the Devils seem to always do well against Pittsburgh.
devils,lxra4cq,2024-11-18 09:10:00,We swept them that year in the regular season if I remember right only. Then round one happened
devils,lxptwpi,2024-11-18 01:01:44,Tampa was coming off a back to back with travel the night before in Toronto when they won 8-5. Tampa just has their number no excuses.
devils,lxsqv7m,2024-11-18 13:50:05,Even weirder if you take out that incredible 2012 SCF run outlier that playoff win against the NYR in 2023 is our only other playoff series win in 17 seasons
devils,lxscc4h,2024-11-18 12:37:16,Those 3 teams play good team defense the penguins do not
devils,lxr5pha,2024-11-18 08:41:29,That game was inexcusable especially defensively and with Jake Allen's performance but Luke and Pesce did not play yet and we were definitely still figuring some things out. That being said the schedule overall the last few weeks has been absolutely brutal and has put us on a clear disadvantage against basically every team we've played especially the games in our conference. Why have we played 4-5 more games than all of our divisional rivals at this point? Even global series aside the schedule has been insane I'm just glad they can get some rest.
devils,lxocyd3,2024-11-17 19:07:54,Tough at nails that guy
devils,lxoe3eu,2024-11-17 19:14:28,He took a skate to face by Randy McKay. It was insane and pretty he stayed in the game.

devils,lxn9bnz,2024-11-17 15:26:51,Wait you mean we play poorly in games we lose? Holy shit someone should look into that more. I wonder if other teams suffer from the same problem. 
devils,lxnf6df,2024-11-17 15:57:57,Not even half a season under Keefe. Chill out
devils,lxn3h6r,2024-11-17 14:55:07,This is a ridiculous take lol
devils,lxnc1mk,2024-11-17 15:41:36,Did you forget that we shut out Calgary for 55 minutes too? Frustrating loss but be realisticThe defense is also night and day compared to Ruff. How often did you see anybody make a hit under him? Dougie a known offensive defenseman is throwing his weight around like crazy. Jack and Bratt are playing the body for christs sakeAt best this is a troll post from a 6 month old account trying to drive engagement or AI training on the opinions of the team. At worst you need additional oxygen to your brain
devils,lxn4hfl,2024-11-17 15:00:43,We ain’t firing Keefe lol
devils,lxn4i9r,2024-11-17 15:00:51,lol what
devils,lxn5942,2024-11-17 15:04:52,Go outside
devils,lxnp2yt,2024-11-17 16:51:21,104 pt pace through 20. Hard to be a doomer with that fact out there. Hell this is arguably with lots of room to ve better. We are clearly a more disciplined team. Let’s leave Facebook on Facebook.
devils,lxn48ir,2024-11-17 14:59:21,We are currently sitting in a playoff spot and just beat the defending Stanley Cup champs back to back in their building and you want to fire Keefe in December to bring in an “offensive minded coach” because we got shut out by Tampa who’s goalie was all fired up and motivated after being honored before the game and also have had like 3 games in the past 2 weeks while the Devils have had like 7 in the past 2 weeks. Did I read that correctly??
devils,lxndkwi,2024-11-17 15:49:33,With that username this has to be a troll.
devils,lxn4noq,2024-11-17 15:01:39,We can't even get the Giants to bench Daniel Jones and u want Keefe to be gone before the holidays
devils,lxnbcjm,2024-11-17 15:37:47,Oh no.... sometimes teams don't generate chances... shit happens. The only stinker was last night. Flames game was a tight defensive game on both ends. Sharks game was a fluke and Blackwood played amazing. Beat Vancouver 6-0 Oilers 3-0 and beat the Panthers in back to back games on their rink including an absolute slutfest on Thursday. 
devils,lxnbcw0,2024-11-17 15:37:51,"Dude couldnt even name a ""offensive minded coach"" he wants. Dude you are over panicking. Its frustrating yes but its also CALLED the players do better. Screen the goalieget pucks to the netsimple easy stuffetc. Dcore hasnt scored like we are use to seeing but all of this is adjustable and fixable players just gotta stop being so predictable at times. Berube has been shut outted twice should the leafs fire him too?"
devils,lxod1w1,2024-11-17 19:08:28,Brother did you take your pills today? You’re finding patterns in nothing again.
devils,lxn4i5c,2024-11-17 15:00:50,Last three losses being shutouts sucks. We also just outscored the defending champs 10-3 in two consecutive games. Sometimes it just be like that.
devils,lxnea0p,2024-11-17 15:53:12,Sharangovich fanboys in shambles this year….…So far
devils,lxnbuln,2024-11-17 15:40:35,We are still missing like 2 true top 6 wingers
devils,lxt7026,2024-11-18 15:11:19,"Every team has times where they struggle to score or have a ""bad game.""Stanley Cup Finalists:2024FLA had 9 games last year where they lost by 3 or more goals. FLA was shut out 7 times once back to back giving up 4 goals each game. They scored two or less another 16 times.EDM had 15 of those games. They were shut out 3 times and scored 2 or less 21 times on top of that.2023VGK - 11 losses by 3 or more shut out twice 2 or less goals in 27 other gamesFLA - 14 by 3 or more 1 SO 23 games with 2 or less.So far we have 3 games by 3 or more (and one of those was 0-0 55min into the game) 3 shutouts and only 2 other games we scored 2 or less. FLA and EDM were 3.23 and 3.56 GF/g last year (NJD 3.22) 2023 VGK and FLA were 3.26 and 3.51 gf/g (NJD 3.52.) We are at 3.42 gf/g this year good for 8th and our GA/g is good for 7th.Stretch that out to a whole season And were trending for 11 losses by 3 or more 11 shutouts and only 8 games with 2 goals or less. Offense isn't the problem. We have the talent and we are scoring above league average. Our defense is coming together as well and are giving up less than league average. Our special teams are also clicking at 5th in the league for pp% and 7th for PK.It's like fans refuse to watch other teams or look at their records and think other talented teams don't have stinkers get goalied have no puck luck or run into another team who is a buzz saw. EVERY team slumps. Every team doesn't bring it 100% every game.This team is talented can compete with the best and still has room to grow. Enjoy the show and understand that not every game will be a masterclass. We'll be cup contenders for a long time with our core."
devils,lxnmmun,2024-11-17 16:37:55,Getting dragged in the comments but I think my main point stands: we are wildly inconsistent on offense and the coach isn’t expressing enough concern about this issue
devils,lxn9oyg,2024-11-17 15:28:46,"Isnt Keefe an offensive mind coach?  I wonder what ""offensive minded coach"" he wanted over Keefe. I personally wanted Woodcroft but Keefe is doing just fine just gotta fix and adjust somethings and we should be good. dude is just overpanicking"
devils,lxn67l3,2024-11-17 15:10:07,Yea. Only 1 high danger chance in the Tampa game. Any goalie in the nhl could’ve gotten the shutout in that game has nothing to do with being goalied. And it’s not just the Tampa game we got shutout by the sharks (bottom team in the league btw) and the flames. Do you not see a pattern here?
devils,lxoddm7,2024-11-17 19:10:18,Please do yourself a favor and look at other teams. Or just learn hockey. Like at all.
devils,lxreq15,2024-11-18 09:38:24,What offensive minded coach do you think will be there in December?
devils,lxnik37,2024-11-17 16:15:35,No. I’m not going to analyze shut outs right now. They are not firing Keefe this is a crazy take.
devils,lxlpa2k,2024-11-17 10:20:39,I'm guessing for them to get playing time in the AHL while Devils have a short break. Or they're bringing in up other forwards but who knows
devils,lxlqso6,2024-11-17 10:29:36,Utica needs all the help they can get. They have yet to win a game.
devils,lxm2vjb,2024-11-17 11:37:37,I say we start using the word “banished” to Utica bc that team is so bad rn I can only imagine playing for them is like the tortures of hell 
devils,lxls9k6,2024-11-17 10:38:09,whichever assistant is in charge of utica's roster should genuinely 100% be fired imo. no one can develop playing on a team that atrocious.
devils,lxmb06n,2024-11-17 12:22:36,Get them a game and also save a couple dollars of cap space is my guess.
devils,lxmf2kr,2024-11-17 12:45:11,Probably just want to accrue some cap. I’m guessing it’s a paper move.
devils,lxmyt8e,2024-11-17 14:29:45,Cap maneuver with 4 days off
devils,lxm4b7w,2024-11-17 11:45:30,Fuck it casey- bowers- halonen what could go wrong (besides a lot)

devils,lxlqng1,2024-11-17 10:28:45,I forget is there a minimum time someone has to stay down before being brought back up?
devils,lxm087t,2024-11-17 11:23:08,Holy shit that’s unbelievable lol
devils,lxlt4ax,2024-11-17 10:43:02,Wow that team is dog water. Yikes
devils,lxltd6l,2024-11-17 10:44:26,They already fired Kevin Dineen.
devils,lxmuk7h,2024-11-17 14:07:19,Fitzgerald effectively controls the roster. They are all players we hope will be useful in the NHL or career pros who are there to teach.
devils,lxn9ync,2024-11-17 15:30:14,He’s a 34 year old AHLer called up to fill a spot on the 4th line. We know his ceiling. He’s been fine
devils,lxmxu9h,2024-11-17 14:24:29,I thought he had a decent game last night.
devils,lxlzdhv,2024-11-17 11:18:24,Even if there is dowling is being listed on puckpedia as being loaned to Utica. Assuming just trying to give him a game with ice time in the ahl. Would love to see Bastian be back but I think he’s still got time but who knows maybe we have some type of trade in the works 
devils,lxm1437,2024-11-17 11:27:57,It’s the goaltending. They have it worse right now than the NJ Devils had it last season and that’s no an exaggeration. Daws and Poulter have been awful no team is going to win games with both goalies posting a ~.800 save percentage.
devils,lxm1i8e,2024-11-17 11:30:06,It’s been the goaltending. Did Utica hire Rogalski’s  son or something?
devils,lxmkoig,2024-11-17 13:15:47,He didn’t assemble the talent so it’s not going to change anything
devils,lxmwwp0,2024-11-17 14:19:35,I mean which players on Utica right now have any NHL potential more than serving as a roster plug in the event of injuries? Basically just Casey and Nemec. Our decent forward prospects (Gritskyuk Hameenaho) play overseas. So the AHL forward squad largely consists of players that are roster plugs even at the AHL level.
devils,lxmyex5,2024-11-17 14:27:36,I wouldn’t mind seeing us move picks for better fourth line depth.  A solid 4C would be ideal Lazar can play wing or center.
devils,lxmfldd,2024-11-17 12:48:05,It's more than goaltending. Team is scoring 1.6 goals per game. Our centers have (1G 2A / 13 GP) (0G 3A / 13 GP) (0G 2A / 13 GP) and (1G 0A / 13 GP). The team turns the puck over constantly and struggles on breakouts.Defense isn't so bad but skewed a little bit towards offensive defensemen. Most of the forward core is weak on both sides of the puck.Dowling (and Xavier Parent returning) will help but this is a 0.300 team if everyone is playing to their potential.
devils,lxm3827,2024-11-17 11:39:33,Yeah Daws really got broken by bringing him up when he was no where near ready. Not like I have any faith in our goalie development eaither way
devils,lxmu4to,2024-11-17 14:05:07,Sad Nico Daws gave us his best while he could. Tough league to be a goalie. At least you're always the best-dressed dude on the ice but being a goalie seems... random.
devils,lxn9i8c,2024-11-17 15:27:48,Maybe Foote. 4th line type. Probabky would need to ramp up his physical game.
devils,lxmkkjd,2024-11-17 13:15:12,I don’t know the stats but I’ve heard the forward corp is ass
devils,lxmb5b3,2024-11-17 12:23:24,Guess daws isn’t our long term solution. We really need some legit goalie prospects
devils,lxnnh02,2024-11-17 16:42:30,If you had a dollar for every fan who wanted Daws in net for the Devils from 21-23 you could buy a really nice car.   Idiot bloggers like this were not alone with hot takes.  https://pucksandpitchforks.com/posts/new-jersey-devils-nico-daws-leads-league-very-important-stat
devils,lxmvwcs,2024-11-17 14:14:15,Because all of our decent forward prospects are either already on the big squad or playing in the KHL or Euro leagues.
devils,lxmubp0,2024-11-17 14:06:07,Parent's probably the best part of it imo so his being hurt has to be challenging.

devils,lxn8wov,2024-11-17 15:24:37,Sounds like a great young man. Gave up his chance to be in the room and on the NHL Network after being drafted to experience it with his family. Hoping he realizes his dream makes the NHL and stays for a long time.
devils,lxl6jl9,2024-11-17 08:14:06,I hope they use these days off to rest and figure out a game plan for the Hurricanes who never seem to lose and have our number. It stinks that they have 3 games in a row against teams that are a nuisance but they need to figure at least 1 of the next 2 out. Why can’t they be playing the Penguins right now?? That’s a team that they always seem to beat regardless of how either team is doing.
devils,lxmad0s,2024-11-17 12:19:02,If you told me before the trip to the Sunshine State the Devils would earn 4 out of a possible 6 points and hold their opponents to 2 points I would have been happy with that.
devils,lxln1m9,2024-11-17 10:07:15,This sub will never be happy. We could win the Stanley cup and people will whine and complain about getting shut out in game 3 of the series.
devils,lxm1m31,2024-11-17 11:30:41,I’m just mad that as a new FL resident I skipped the two in SoFlo since I’d been to that arena a few years back and opted to check out Tampa for the first time instead. Nice area around Amalie and worth the drive other than some of them deciding to take the game off -_-
devils,lxln0z6,2024-11-17 10:07:09,This sub will never be happy. We could win the Stanley cup and people will whine and complain about getting shut out in game 3 of the series.
devils,lxl1czc,2024-11-17 07:31:21,It’s not room for emergency but we’ve been shutout a lot this early in the season. Which might have to do with being more conservative on defense and resulting in less Ruff style transition game.Do we need another scoring forward? Obviously Cotter and Noesen have worked out for that. But we might need one more guy. Maybe we’re trying to see what we can squeeze out of Palat and Tatar hasn’t had much of a shot playing with that 4th line so much.
devils,lxl7cba,2024-11-17 08:20:15,21 games 3 shutouts 3 times shut out can curve stomp teams but can't win more than 3 in a row? This year is so weird but oh well.
devils,lxl7l1z,2024-11-17 08:22:07,Hurricanes Tampa and Boston always seem to have our number. Is what it is.
devils,lxnlugy,2024-11-17 16:33:34,I agree that this sub never seems to be happy. But a 4 or 5 game win streak would be nice. They've won 7 out of their last 10. Got 4 points against the Panthers so im happy. Yea it sucks to get shutout but I'm still happy. Let's just enjoy theam
devils,lxly9as,2024-11-17 11:12:10,I just want to see a win streak of more than 3 games which hasn’t happened since 22-23. If we can’t string together more than 3 in a row we’re going to have a hard time closing out a playoff series.
devils,lxlyrgh,2024-11-17 11:14:59,Not sure if that would have helped up last night. Tampa put on a defensive clinic and Vasi was on the top of his game you could tell he wasn’t going to let in anything last night.Edit - we also have Gritsyuk incoming perhaps later this season when the KHL season ends. He could help bring some additional firepower in the top six.
devils,lxl7qo9,2024-11-17 08:23:17,They played against one of the best goalies in the game and got shut out.  I wouldn’t panic I basically wrote that game as a loss before I even turned it on. Sometimes the puck bounces the other way in regards to the San Jose game.
devils,lxl5xhm,2024-11-17 08:09:17,I do feel like they are missing a player like a Toffoli but it also might be a particular style of play against us that coaching needs to work on/figure out. They scored a bunch against the Panthers. Guys like Jack Bratt Nico Timo are going to score more often than not but they do need to figure out teams like Tampa and Carolina who have it down against them.
devils,lxldhh3,2024-11-17 09:04:55,*curb/kerb
devils,lxlzdf2,2024-11-17 11:18:23,Their schedule has been brutal and they have barely had time to have team practices. I’m hoping the next 4 days they have off they can regroup a bit and come out flying against Carolina and then build off that win.
devils,lxlxulu,2024-11-17 11:09:56,I’d swap out Boston for Washington. Boston we typically play pretty close games against and have some success. Washington has been a pest for us since the COVID season when they went 8-0 against us.
devils,lxm3g9r,2024-11-17 11:40:48,I don’t care about win streaks just get me into the dance and I’m happy
devils,lxt76ea,2024-11-18 15:12:14,"That does make it sound longer than ""it didn't happen last year"" you know the season they were crippled."
devils,lxllkw7,2024-11-17 09:58:24,Yeah I think in our final form we might need that one guy who can make an individual play to snipe one. I know our goals for is fine. But as good as Mercer is at a lot of things he doesn’t have the offensive feel and some of our supporting players like I mentioned aren’t the guy there either. Need someone to pick up the goalscoring slack once Noesen or Nico slows down.Maybe it comes from within. Dougie or Timo step up. But we need probably at least one forward.
devils,lxm05hu,2024-11-17 11:22:43,It’s the well structured veteran teams that can play lockdown defense that give us the most trouble especially if they also have a vet goalie in net. This team is definitely better structured but they rarely get to practice due to their hectic schedule so far. These next 4 days should give them the chance to get a few practices in hopefully they’ll be synced up against Carolina.
devils,lxm3y3o,2024-11-17 11:43:29,Bring up Casey and make up an injury for Dougie. He looks washed on the offensive side of the ice. That shot ain’t what it used to be
devils,lxm3x1n,2024-11-17 11:43:19,If we get in it would be nice to get through at least the first round which will be difficult if we can’t put together win streaks.
devils,lxmv1gk,2024-11-17 14:09:47,You're going to need some win streaks to get to the dance. We don't need some 13 game heater but going on a 5 or 6 streak will give some cushion so the team doesn't need to stare at the standings.
devils,lxjinkr,2024-11-16 22:46:21,"""give puk"""
devils,lxkau3f,2024-11-17 02:46:23,Write it in swiss for nico/jonas or german. Worked for me when I asked Kovy to throw me a puck (in russian).

devils,lxjd523,2024-11-16 22:09:05,Devils looked like a team that played 5 games in 7 days and Tampa looked liked a team that played 2 games in 9 days
devils,lxjbyks,2024-11-16 22:01:07,A week ago we were saying we’d be happy to come away from this roadie with any points at all. Sucks to lose but 4/6 against some very strong teams isn’t bad
devils,lxjh9gy,2024-11-16 22:36:57,Well we beat the panthers twice and then the panthers beat the league leading jets so theres that.
devils,lxjalzg,2024-11-16 21:52:11,4 out 6 points in Florida is good. Being shutout twice in one week is very bad. Boys get a much needed 4 days off to rest and practice. We got Carolina on the 21st. Let’s take it to them!
devils,lxjiyfx,2024-11-16 22:48:22,Luke is a demon gonna see him on the score sheet more and more. I love that Keefe is encouraging him to push his offence. 4th line is hard to watch I wish we would shake things up there. Kermit is tough in all aspects can't expect much else. Tatar is doing what he can. Dowling to me has been the one we need more from. Multiple times a game he pulls up or skates out of the o-zone when we have a good forecheck going allowing the other team to make one pass and we lose all pressure. Really looks like he's afraid to lose his nhl spot and it's making him worse.Get better soon Lazer and Bass.
devils,lxjawt5,2024-11-16 21:54:09,Frustrating to get shut out again but Tampa played an absolutely smothering D tonight. And of course any shot that did get on net was headed toward a locked in Vasilevsky so pretty much a perfect storm for our offense tonight. At the end of the day I'll gladly take 2 of 3 in Florida as we finally get some days off in this early season gauntlet.
devils,lxjcn77,2024-11-16 22:05:43,Wasn’t a fun one to watch but 2/3 on the road and a week off to rest back at it Thursday boys
devils,lxje7ls,2024-11-16 22:16:13,I’ve been thinking of these last 3 series as baseball series and they’ve won all 3 - 2/3 out west 2/3 back East and 2/3 in FL. I’m pretty happy with that honestly. I was worried especially about this trip because of the opponents and they got 4 points against the defending champs no complaints there. They got beaten tonight by a Tampa team that is a thorn for them is a strong competitor and was pretty well rested only having played 2 games in 9 days to the Devils - I don’t even know I lost count games in however many days. Now they get a much needed little break to rest and practice. Some guys look legit tired and maybe have nagging injuries that can heal up. I’m pretty happy with this team up to this point. Can things be better? Sure but they’ve handled this first part of the season with a new coach new system new players a lot of games and travel pretty well and I’m excited to see where they go from here. LGD
devils,lxjck9e,2024-11-16 22:05:10,Tampa has our number. It is what it is. 2/3 on the road trip against the panthers twice and lightning is still a successful one. Get a well earned 4 day rest and bring it against the canes and caps
devils,lxjkwr5,2024-11-16 23:02:07,Absolutely bullshit that devils played what 5 games in the last 8 days and Tampa had 2 games in the last 9. The boys were gassed it doesn't help that they're basically rolling out 3 lines a night
devils,lxjb1p2,2024-11-16 21:55:04,Welp I figured we'd get an L against Tampa but even with the shutout the effort was there.Tampa was just the better team across the ice tonight and Vasi was a stonewall.
devils,lxjb6xj,2024-11-16 21:56:02,They won 2 of 3 on this road trip. That's more than what I was expecting. Let's make good use of this long overdue rest and kick some ass against the canes and caps next week.
devils,lxjw8e0,2024-11-17 00:30:37,We weren’t our best Markstrom was great. vasilevsky was better and Tampa played a perfect game. It happens
devils,lxk4vrx,2024-11-17 01:45:31,It seems I picked the perfect game to sleep through
devils,lxjanu1,2024-11-16 21:52:31,Good to at least see Luke stick it to them
devils,lxjb03w,2024-11-16 21:54:46,Hope they take advantage of their 4 days off to get some rest and practice in.
devils,lxjbxkj,2024-11-16 22:00:56,with the long break now hope they adjust and fix some much needed things. Since they are back home i can see a call up happening. Lots of thing i didnt like but they also did a lot of good just fix somethings and we good.
devils,lxje3pl,2024-11-16 22:15:31,They just looked gassed and couldn’t solve the D. Let’s hope the Canes and Caps games give us another pleasant surprise!
devils,lxjbtlw,2024-11-16 22:00:12,That elusive third straight win strikes again. But overall coming home from Florida with 4 points banked is solid. Frustrating but that was a masterclass defensive performance by Tampa and Vasi wasn’t going to budge tonight. I’m just frustrated because it seems like whenever I can actually watch the full game or go to a game they lose this season. Have yet to see an in-person win this season and have seen 3 wins of games I’ve watched on TV lol. Last game I got to watch was SJ I’ll settle for just seeing them score a goal while I’m watching.
devils,lxjg9mo,2024-11-16 22:30:04,My fault..haven't been able to watch many games because of my work schedule..ended up getting to watch this one and this happens...my bad
devils,lxjsl8f,2024-11-17 00:00:29,The passing on display from Tampa tonight was no coincidence. Cooper has his guys well-coached to beat us - aggressive fast puck-moving and nearly immovable in front of their net. If we can master the high point shot the way they have we can stretch defenses like this but for now they can dominate us in their slot and the odds tip in their favor. Good game by Marky nowhere near enough physicality from us. A game played at this pace doesn't need big open ice hits but it does need a lot of tenacity. Except for Kuch who may be the most-deserving player in the league to get run into the boards hard face down ass up. Your day is coming coward. All in all not a terrible game at all from us but we never really had any sustained pressure or clean looks andthe same could not be said the other way round.
devils,lxjfr92,2024-11-16 22:26:32,*its fine*:* look honestly I wasnt expecting much from this game. two very high quality wins back to back and it would have been great to keep it rolling against Tampa but I really was just wanting like a point here. * after the Sharks game I was really hoping for four points from the two Panthers games the Tampa game and the upcoming Carolina game and the fact that we got four within the first two was good enough!* obviously would have loved a win or a point but you have to give props to Tampa here tonight. they played a perfect game against us. we had nothing going and when we found something we met the Vasilevskiy wall.* Tampa just had an answer for us at every turn blocked shots sticks in lanes bodies in lanes just frustrating us the entire time and we got nothing going.* it happens! it isnt a sign of any underlying issue.* plus its insane that they had a whole fucking week off meanwhile we're running around like fucking hot wheels playing a fuck ton of games in such limited time* Im happy they get this break to really rest and also get some practices in. tho I will miss Devils hockey!* goaltending is looking way better and I'm feeling a lot more confident than I was in our netminding* Luke and Pesce are a fucking revelation. when Luke finds his offensive stick again we're gonna be fucking rolling.* I hope we get either Nate back or Fitz et al have plans for our fourth line. I understand what MacDermid is there for but he cant be playing this many games. We need a real fourth line again. * can't win them all and it definitely isnt the sky is falling times* more of like a *womp womp*I'm just hoping these boys can start winning some games in front of the home crowd!
devils,lxjb7vs,2024-11-16 21:56:12,Sick. I fucking hate the metro division
devils,lxjq7kg,2024-11-16 23:42:17,successful florida trip all things considered. with the canes and caps next and the schedule not getting super easy after i hope fitz is working on a 4th line. I dont wanna pick on Dermy but when he plays we are going 11/6 most of the game guys are double shifting and playing elevated minutes it will catch up to you like it appeared to do tonight. This team will be so much better when we can roll 4 lines
devils,lxjaiz4,2024-11-16 21:51:38,Would’ve snapped your hand off for four points from that Florida trip
devils,lxjas6e,2024-11-16 21:53:19,Feast or famine eh
devils,lxjay7u,2024-11-16 21:54:25,Does Kermit give anyone else big David Harbour vibes?
devils,lxjbymp,2024-11-16 22:01:07,The last couple of losses we’ve had have given me confidence that we have a solid defense on our hands. We’re definitely making it hard for the opposing team to put goals in net by getting sticks in lanes and we’ve held teams to a low number of goals in the past 9 games before today. The issue now is that the offense has been pretty inconsistent and we’ve been shutout in our last 3 losses which is a worrying pattern. Not going to doom though I’m optimistic that we’re going to figure it out. This is the first time that we’ve seen Keefe’s system struggle to put up goals in the NHL and if anyone has the ability to fix it it’s him.
devils,lxjbaxv,2024-11-16 21:56:46,"There was no issue of energy or commitment tonight. Tampa matched our guys very well and made the most of it. Losing sucks getting shut out sucks more but 4/6 points on the trip clobbering the reigning champs and keeping this game competitive is enough to make me believe we're in good shape for the season. Neither team dominated tonight regardless of what the scoreboard says. Let's get some well deserved rest and be ready for Carolina. We've turned a page since we last played themAnd to the idiot who replied to one of my comments saying ""I don't think Vasi had to make more than 1 save tonight"" I urge you to seek adult literacy courses so you can read the stats which say we put up 29 shots"
devils,lxm8ht2,2024-11-17 12:08:35,This team seems to have our number. Hopefully we dont play them in the playoffs

devils,lxjb0lw,2024-11-16 21:54:51,This team weird sometiem
devils,lxjbnne,2024-11-16 21:59:07,First 6 minutes was great fuck the rest of the game.
devils,lxjaln4,2024-11-16 21:52:07,Disappointing loss after two emotions wins. Especially with the Tampa roster on paper looking the worst it’s been in a long time
devils,lxjbzmk,2024-11-16 22:01:18,Horrible game. I despise Tampa. To lose in a shutout to Tampa when they’re missing their second best player and when we have the depth advantage is sickening especially after what we did against an actual cup winning team.Dillon and Dougie either need to be broken up or played as a third pairing and get sheltered beyond belief.  We need a functioning 4th line.  I also hate how we have been shut out 3 times this month. 2 times by utter shit teams and against this nursing home of a team in Tampa that is ref assisted beyond belief. 
devils,lxjaxl0,2024-11-16 21:54:18,![gif](giphy|WrxoaVPiq0cG4)
devils,lxjclx4,2024-11-16 22:05:28,What really sucks is we play the canes next in Newark where we suck and against a team we suck against. Then it’s the caps who we also lose to even when we are the better team. And the caps this year are actual good. Markstrom isnt why we lost but he has to stop coughing up 3 goals against a night like he’s vitek. 
devils,lxjv4w2,2024-11-17 00:21:25,Stop handcuffing yourself and play 12 forwards. McDermid is awesome but this guy is not an NHL skater. Youre basically playing 11 forwards when he dresses
devils,lxjcb7k,2024-11-16 22:03:28,This is where I’m at disappointing we lost today the way we did but overall even in this loss the team has improved from a month ago and just needs to find more consistency in the offense
devils,lxjg7a4,2024-11-16 22:29:38,Absolutely. I would’ve been happy to get 3 points on this trip and wouldn’t have been upset with 2. Getting all 4 points against a very hot Panthers team (that then destroyed the Jets tonight) is big and tonight’s anticlimactic finale shouldn’t detract from that.Two steps forward one step back can be frustrating but it still means progress. They just have to go home get some real rest for the first time all season and then come out strong next game.
devils,lxjb5tb,2024-11-16 21:55:49,This will the first break of more than 2 days they’ve had since they got back for Czechia. Like ya said that extra rest and practice should do em well.
devils,lxjbnh9,2024-11-16 21:59:05,The fact that we played four games in one week kinda rough lol
devils,lxjmf54,2024-11-16 23:13:15,Luke is just scratching the surface of his potential.  He’s playing plus defense and will end up with 60 points.  By the end of the season if everyone stays healthy for the most part we’re gonna have two balanced dominant pairings in our top 4 and a third pairing that can shut anyone’s best players down.   That’s the formula for winning in playoffs.4th line is our weakness now by the trade deadline that will be solved via trade or regaining healthy troops or both.  I’m not worried at all.Keep racking up points.  The way to look at a regular season is in 15 game blocks.  The goal should be get 20 points out of every 15 games and we’ll be at the top of the standings and have secured home ice in at least round one if not more.
devils,lxlq42c,2024-11-17 10:25:35,Just like we have Vancouver's. Doesn't make them a bad team and doesn't make us one either.
devils,lxjs0cz,2024-11-16 23:55:57,I feel like we get screwed on the schedule all the time. Never see the rags have to play back to back games lol
devils,lxjdm43,2024-11-16 22:12:16,Need to call up Foote. Dowling is a liability. He’s not outright bad but he provides absolutely zero positives.
devils,lxjchyx,2024-11-16 22:04:44,Just FYI we have won 3 in a row this year. I don’t think they’ve won 4+ in a row though going back to the 2022-2023 season which is uh not great.
devils,lxmabed,2024-11-17 12:18:46,Work forever. 
devils,lxjghwd,2024-11-16 22:31:38,Theres 3-4 guys in the AHL that should get a shot but its up to fitzy.
devils,lxjchv0,2024-11-16 22:04:43,Regular season sure Playoffs yeah he struggled in playoffs. Ask any leaf fan about keefe and scoring in playoffs.  Lets hope next game they come out like they did for Panthers gm 2
devils,lxjc1hp,2024-11-16 22:01:39,Would have liked to win but Tampa really clogged up the middle and Vasy was great. We aren’t going to win them all they didn’t play poorly hopefully the rest and practice will give us a good showing against Carolina.
devils,lxjdfmz,2024-11-16 22:11:03,There shall be no Vitek besmirchment
devils,lxlfx5u,2024-11-17 09:21:46,Agreed I think not being able to roll a 4th line regularly has compounded their congested schedule to start the season. Dowling and MacDermid combined get as much ice time as Tatar. When you have to give your top forwards an extra 4 or 5 shifts every game it starts to add up.  Hopefully once bastian and Lazar come back it’ll be better. 
devils,lxjbc38,2024-11-16 21:56:59,I hope we come out strong against Carolina. They’ve really kicked our ass lately. If we want to be taken seriously in our division we need to start playing them tough.
devils,lxjv7e3,2024-11-17 00:22:00,According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1dtvvx3/list_of_how_many_sets_of_back_to_back_games_each/?rdt=59673) the rangers have 14 back to backs this season while we only have 12.
devils,lxje34t,2024-11-16 22:15:25,One problem Foote is not a center only center worth calling up is beckman/willman. I rather call up Halonen give NJ a goal scorer and a righty.Correction: Could Send Dowling Down Move Cotter for 4C and call up 2. need to atleast IR one of Lazar/Bass if wanna bring up 2. Personally i would like 2 call ups.
devils,lxjdrji,2024-11-16 22:13:17,Just the once yea. That definitely needs to change. We need to be able to string together a few wins here and there
devils,lxlxb6s,2024-11-17 11:06:57,I know it happened once but we need to be able to string together 4+ pretty regularly if we want to be a playoff team. The 2017-2018 team did it and made the playoffs the 22-23 team did and made the playoffs. The seasons that we have not done it we did not make the playoffs. And if we can’t regularly put together those kind of streaks it will be difficult to close out a playoff series if we do end up getting there. So 4+ is my bellwether if this is a playoff competitor or not. I do think we’ll get it done at some point this season but we need to string together wins if we want to have any success in the playoffs.
devils,lxmayn9,2024-11-17 12:22:22,I want them to call up Halonen
devils,lxjctxd,2024-11-16 22:07:00,Leafs fans are idiots that can’t accept the issues with their players. 
devils,lxjdf1g,2024-11-16 22:10:56,You got me there but right now we’re in the regular season and we need to figure out regular season performance first before worrying about the playoffs
devils,lxjcqcs,2024-11-16 22:06:19,Agreed. If we can get two points there this would be a very successful four game straight against some of the East’s best.
devils,lxjd12q,2024-11-16 22:08:21,both could be true.
devils,lxjcxsf,2024-11-16 22:07:43,Don’t forget we have Washington right after. We could exercise a lot of demons this month. Would make for a great Thanksgiving.
devils,lxje46d,2024-11-16 22:15:36,Did forget! Great call!
devils,lxlptrn,2024-11-17 10:23:54,Caps and Tampa are just teams that seem to have our number regardless of standings etc. Much like we seem to own Vancouver for whatever reason.
devils,lxj0a34,2024-11-16 20:44:25,Timeouts are rarely used in hockey regardless of who the coach is.
devils,lxiz7eg,2024-11-16 20:37:42,He's used them more than Lindy has already this far into the season I haven't really seen any points in any game where one would've been beneficial maybe like once.
devils,lxj1zlr,2024-11-16 20:55:17,The coach is only allowed to call ONE timeout per game regardless of how many periods there are (5 minute OT / 20 minute OT)... Why waste it in the 2nd?
devils,lxj95nf,2024-11-16 21:42:30,Game thread
devils,lxpw530,2024-11-18 01:22:36,The ice typically tilts back and forth with two relatively evenly-matched teams. You can't take a timeout every time that happens.In important games (like playoffs) or massive breakdowns that are out of the ordinary I would say could warrant an early timeout. But as others have mentioned you can also just wait for a commercial break to use that as a timeout.
devils,lxj4em6,2024-11-16 21:11:03,Especially considering every commercial break is a free time out.
devils,lxjb6kq,2024-11-16 21:55:58,Lindy with his glazed over eyes. I don't know if that dude was aware of really anything going on he was so checked out.

devils,lxj7nmg,2024-11-16 21:32:32,So far the bright spot has been Luke and Pesce. I always knew Luke had it in him. He was shit on so much last season for basically being a rookie taking on way too much responsibility and he still managed to to be a Calder finalist.

devils,lxiteg0,2024-11-16 20:01:03,Personally the Devils look a bit tired after two tough games vs the defending champs and at the end of a road trip. Doesn't mean they can't find a spark or anything but this game always had the potential for a letdown after the first two games.

devils,lxj28v2,2024-11-16 20:56:54,okay we're not down and out yet. still have a third period to play and honestly I think we're looking better as the game progresses. we just need to get one goal to trickle past Vasilevskiy and we're back in it. but honestly we're definitely getting goalied here by a very good goalie like its bound to happen. proud of the boys for continuing to fight it out and push. come out in the third with a vengeance and really just pepper that man with shots. I would love to end this game with at least a point and I think we have it in us.
devils,lxj56di,2024-11-16 21:16:08,Thank god we won both games in Florida. That’s huge right now
devils,lxj5al1,2024-11-16 21:16:55,Surprised everyone has given up on this one still almost a full period left.
devils,lxj6fse,2024-11-16 21:24:27,I just want one pity goal. I hate getting shutout
devils,lxj6o5v,2024-11-16 21:26:01,MacDermid on the ice down 2 is just absolutely ridiculous. He literally cannot contribute to winning when you need 2 goals in the 3rd.
devils,lxj860q,2024-11-16 21:35:54,Guys F Tampa this team kicked ass against the panthers. Don’t forget it
devils,lxj8g2q,2024-11-16 21:37:47,Tampa played twice in 9 games Devils are traveling all over the world and North America in the span of a month or so lol
devils,lxj91gb,2024-11-16 21:41:44,I think Sal has a point there. It will be interesting to see how we come out against Carolina after 4 days off. But the NHL schedule shouldn’t be this lopsided honestly. Tonight we’ve played 5 games more than Carolina for instance? That’s weird no?
devils,lxj7grc,2024-11-16 21:31:16,Shame the doomers are out in full force. A week ago we would've gladly left Florida with four points. Can't win them all especially against a team as talented and well coached as TBL. Just move onto the next one.
devils,lxik0mo,2024-11-16 19:03:17,**FYI** game start will be ***delayed*** due to honoring Vasilevskiy's three hundredth win. will be a 7:15 puck drop it seems
devils,lxiob3p,2024-11-16 19:29:36,Cant be mad with how they are playing so far keep it up
devils,lxip1mi,2024-11-16 19:34:08,Shitbag rags fan flipping Dougie off figures
devils,lxipjld,2024-11-16 19:37:14,Palat looking good early. Some great feeds to Jack so far
devils,lxiqaq3,2024-11-16 19:41:55,How is that not boarding????
devils,lxiqwff,2024-11-16 19:45:33,I was just typing that Tampa looking a lot more alive in the second half of this period and then they scored.Gotta get control back. Come on boys!
devils,lxis58j,2024-11-16 19:53:14,Palat with absolute cement hands.
devils,lxisgvn,2024-11-16 19:55:14,DJ Paulie Cotts only drops hits
devils,lxismtj,2024-11-16 19:56:15,They've regained my trust that they won't turn into pumpkins. Not the best period but this is far from over. Lay off on Dougie he's always been good for a random penalty
devils,lxiyjap,2024-11-16 20:33:30,HAIL MARKSTROM HOLY
devils,lxiyobg,2024-11-16 20:34:21,Even the Tampa fans here applauded that stop. Glovely!

devils,lxizoq6,2024-11-16 20:40:40,Pesce just broke that dude's ankles gd
devils,lxj7e0a,2024-11-16 21:30:47,Also we have a nice 4 days off to get the legs back and get some practice in. I know Chief Keefe said since they had an early start to the season they haven’t had a lot of practice time so hopefully it helps.
devils,lxjackm,2024-11-16 21:50:26,Lol Luke should take up curling or maybe he already has
devils,lxi27qd,2024-11-16 17:15:21,Florida sweep lessssgoooo
devils,lxinocw,2024-11-16 19:25:44,eating up Dano's Nico praise.
devils,lxinypk,2024-11-16 19:27:30,Cotter deserves a birthday goal and win
devils,lxipffn,2024-11-16 19:36:30,Noticing more Nico grimaces lately. Cap needs a break.
devils,lxipqyq,2024-11-16 19:38:30,Tatar has not looked terrible with other linemates tbf
devils,lxiq8l4,2024-11-16 19:41:32,No boarding??
devils,lxiq92d,2024-11-16 19:41:37,Was that boarding?
devils,lxir0yi,2024-11-16 19:46:19,mayhaps I would not send out our fourth line right after a goal against? but thats just me.
devils,lxisgni,2024-11-16 19:55:12,Palat literally has done none of the things he was brought here to do. Can’t wait to get that albatross off the roster
devils,lxismqy,2024-11-16 19:56:14,Solid period overall but I'm worried about Tampa's response in the 2nd if we can weather that storm we can still get a W here
devils,lxiylat,2024-11-16 20:33:51,Markstrom keeping the Devils in this.
devils,lxiylce,2024-11-16 20:33:51,MARKSTROM FOR MVP
devils,lxiynql,2024-11-16 20:34:15,Why are we so slow today
devils,lxiysk4,2024-11-16 20:35:06,Markstrom is fighting for this. We need some goals to show our appreciation. We gotta just pound their net and cause a little confusion. Seems to be the only way we will get anything past them.
devils,lxiyvvu,2024-11-16 20:35:41,Markstrom absolutely unreal tonight
devils,lxj02wf,2024-11-16 20:43:09,I hope cotter destroys his career highs with us he's absolutely on pace to.
devils,lxj0yf9,2024-11-16 20:48:41,It’s time to promote Luke to pp1 and try it out
devils,lxj0yhc,2024-11-16 20:48:42,Mercer always fucking hesitates. Bro needs to learn to pull the trigger
devils,lxj1yqw,2024-11-16 20:55:08,Dano just said pee pee goal haha
devils,lxj259f,2024-11-16 20:56:17,Rebounds.  Tip ins.  Screens.  That the the way....
devils,lxj4skl,2024-11-16 21:13:36,No matter what I believe in this team!
devils,lxj5cb0,2024-11-16 21:17:13,I guess Tampa just has our number. Crazy that we played so well against the Panthers and so far we’ve been meh against Tampa. Still plenty of game left prove me wrong boys!
devils,lxj67st,2024-11-16 21:22:57,Need one of our defenseman to actually get a puck on net. 
devils,lxj6wqj,2024-11-16 21:27:36,not our night. sorry Marky u deserved way better tonight
devils,lxj6ybi,2024-11-16 21:27:54,Honestly man Tampa just needs to fuck off
devils,lxj6zkr,2024-11-16 21:28:09,All the 3 goals coming from up top because other teams don’t reflexively shoot it right into shin pads like the devils do. They give up too many scoring chances from the point they need to get in more shooting lanes like everyone else does to them.
devils,lxj79me,2024-11-16 21:29:58,The back pressure from the Tampa Bay forwards is relentless.
devils,lxj8c9j,2024-11-16 21:37:04,2 games in 9 days!?! Other teams get to practice and recover?
devils,lxj9qa7,2024-11-16 21:46:18,Knew as soon as they were honoring vasy he was getting the shut out
devils,lxja5xv,2024-11-16 21:49:12,Lmfao Luke
devils,lxjb7zq,2024-11-16 21:56:14,Of course the scriptwriters had to give Vasilevskiy the shutout on his big night
devils,lxi5q79,2024-11-16 17:35:30,Would be awesome to get a win tonight before the long break they have after tonight. Get two more points keep the vibes high then get back to Jersey for some much needed rest and solid practice time before facing off against Carolina and Washington
devils,lxile13,2024-11-16 19:11:39,300 wins are impressive but call me when Vassy gets to 691
devils,lxilqgy,2024-11-16 19:13:46,It’s obviously just my bias but I swear we deal with more ceremonies delaying starts than anyone
devils,lxio7c5,2024-11-16 19:28:58,loving our first period so far. we're not giving Tampa anything and Nico's line is doing a great job of shutting down their top players thus far.just want the Devils to be rewarded with a goal or two past Vasilevskiy before the end of the period.
devils,lxiox0x,2024-11-16 19:33:20,Real tough guy sitting behind the penalty box
devils,lxipfwn,2024-11-16 19:36:35,Good kill
devils,lxiqrqu,2024-11-16 19:44:46,Damn felt that one coming over the last minute
devils,lxiqscx,2024-11-16 19:44:52,We were playing so solid and made one mistake on man coverage and bam
devils,lxiquqv,2024-11-16 19:45:16,Ah fuck they had us on the ropes there for a bit
devils,lxiqvh0,2024-11-16 19:45:24,Fucking figures we've been dominant the whole fucking game.
devils,lxir8r1,2024-11-16 19:47:40,Wtf is up with these refs? First no call on the hit from behind theb he skates in front of dougie to prevent him from defending the forward.
devils,lxivbo0,2024-11-16 20:13:12,Why do we have to get the “let’s honor the goalie for a big milestone and now he’ll be a brick wall” game??

devils,lxiwwre,2024-11-16 20:23:17,Sometimes it is simple.  TB has just a bit more energy.  They are taking away time and space.   Turn it around with this PP.
devils,lxix4fh,2024-11-16 20:24:39,That was almost the most Devils sequence of all time
devils,lxix6qh,2024-11-16 20:25:04,Luke you beautiful boy
devils,lxixjwm,2024-11-16 20:27:23,Both goalies making some nice saves tonight.
devils,lxixnky,2024-11-16 20:28:01,Tampa's playing extremely solid and they got the goaltending to boot but we are getting some chances
devils,lxixpua,2024-11-16 20:28:24,Just turned the game on but Luke has been noticeably good.

devils,lxiyv9z,2024-11-16 20:35:34,They need to get one for their tender
devils,lxiz898,2024-11-16 20:37:51,Boys can’t even keep the puck on their sticks. Markstrom’s keeping us in it. Hope they wake up soon.
devils,lxizdx2,2024-11-16 20:38:49,MoneyPuck does not lie so far....  Flip the script with an equalizer....
devils,lxiziyz,2024-11-16 20:39:41,I’m not a conspiracy theorist but it sure seems like the NHL has decided Haula is not allowed to take faceoffs.
devils,lxizmoj,2024-11-16 20:40:19,I don't think I've ever heard Sal comment on what should've been a blatant penalty like that unbelievable
devils,lxizncs,2024-11-16 20:40:26,obligatory I love Brett Pesce comment
devils,lxj0h4j,2024-11-16 20:45:38,Big PP
devils,lxj0zeo,2024-11-16 20:48:51,Can we try Luke on pp1
devils,lxj2pmg,2024-11-16 20:59:56,Anyone see the Reaves hit on Darnell Nurse??? Absolutely brutal head hunting hope he gets like 10 games for that one.
devils,lxj2vf6,2024-11-16 21:01:00,Looks like the Cats took offense to our two wins.
devils,lxj5dl1,2024-11-16 21:17:27,It's voodoo jinx time. THIS GAME IS OVER. SEE YOU ALL IN A FEW DAYS.
devils,lxj5o29,2024-11-16 21:19:21,Nico’s drawn 13 penalties and taken 0. Crazy
devils,lxj5pe4,2024-11-16 21:19:35,So I know Nico draws a lot of penalties but I have never felt like he is one of those guys who embellishes or anything. People just think they can shit in him.
devils,lxj646c,2024-11-16 21:22:17,Did I miss something? What’s with the boos for when Luke has the puck?
devils,lxj6gll,2024-11-16 21:24:37,Can’t win them all. Still impressed we smacked the Panthers around twice. Tampa is a damn good team with a great goalie. Still feel good about the boys overall.
devils,lxj6tyo,2024-11-16 21:27:06,THAT is NOT GOOD
devils,lxj6wvl,2024-11-16 21:27:38,Man Marky did not deserve this tonight
devils,lxj75c3,2024-11-16 21:29:12,Mannnn the devils have certain teams where they always are seeing ghosts. Tampa is one of those teams.
devils,lxj8bm3,2024-11-16 21:36:57,1 game team is playing very well and has a deep playoff run in them
devils,lxj9bqb,2024-11-16 21:43:38,Tampa just has a roster and play style that pretty much counters us they have guys that can match our speed are very good at controlling the neutral zone positions their defensmen to smother breakouts and have one of the best goalies in the league to cover the defensive mistakes that do occur in games.
devils,lxja4iu,2024-11-16 21:48:56,Vasilevksy has made some unreal saves all game long unbelievable.
devils,lxja7jk,2024-11-16 21:49:30,That stick throw was easily the best play they’ve made tonight. Legitimately the first entertaining thing they did lol
devils,lxjaeh3,2024-11-16 21:50:48,lol Luke that was cute
devils,lxja94g,2024-11-16 21:49:48,lol dooming on team that just dominated the SC champs twice in two days.
devils,lxipnin,2024-11-16 19:37:55,This is the most boring game of hockey I’ve seen in recent memory. And I love it
devils,lxit8qr,2024-11-16 20:00:04,first half of the first period was all us but after the Tampa PP even though we killed it it was all Tampa. we were definitely on the back foot and you could feel a goal against coming. however I'm glad we got out of that period with only a one goal deficit. the more that period went on the more it felt like it could be even worse. I feel like the true x factor tonight witll be Vasilevskiy. I think we can one hundred percent keep up with this Tampa team and even beat them but we got to be able to beat their goalie. If their goalie is having an on night thats when we're in trouble.thankfully we have forty minutes to get back in it! lets go!
devils,lxidadi,2024-11-16 18:21:21,Let’s go devils! Let’s get that Florida sweep!
devils,lxiekhv,2024-11-16 18:29:24,I'd like to humbly request the New Jersey Devils Hockey Team plays better than the Tampa Bay Lightning Hockey Team
devils,lxieodh,2024-11-16 18:30:03,If we score 1 goal I’m getting super high. For every goal above that I’m adding a duper- and there ain’t nothing anyone can do about that.
devils,lxijw8v,2024-11-16 19:02:33,15 minute puck drop delay means more time for my Chinese food to get here
devils,lxilcvr,2024-11-16 19:11:27,Watching the ceremony for vasy on the tb stream he might be one of the only nhl players married to a brunette
devils,lximjx7,2024-11-16 19:18:48,Vasy is an amazing goalie but he can fuck right off tonight.
devils,lxinkbw,2024-11-16 19:25:03,Bratter I love you
devils,lxinknc,2024-11-16 19:25:06,Bratt hustles back and saves us so many times
devils,lxinv66,2024-11-16 19:26:53,Kucherov may be the second coming of Datsyuk but he can also fuck right off tonight.
devils,lxio5au,2024-11-16 19:28:37,Geekie with the cheap shot Bratt. Mac do yo’ thang.
devils,lxiqbyo,2024-11-16 19:42:07,very good save there by Marky! feel like that was a prime scoring opportunity for Tampa where they would have scored against us before.
devils,lxiqfje,2024-11-16 19:42:44,Wasn't a vicious hit  but that's still a 2 min penalty for boarding imo
devils,lxiqquh,2024-11-16 19:44:37,That was coming. Just too many chanced.
devils,lxiqra8,2024-11-16 19:44:41,I really like tampas matte black buckets
devils,lxir0m9,2024-11-16 19:46:16,This team plays worse against tampa its a fact
devils,lxirhpk,2024-11-16 19:49:13,Game feels kinda flat from both teams so far better chug some Gato in the locker room and pick it up in the second.
devils,lxis70v,2024-11-16 19:53:33,Palat that was pathetic.
devils,lxisi8t,2024-11-16 19:55:28,Dj Pauly c was such a trade steal ugh
devils,lxismr7,2024-11-16 19:56:14,Well that sucked but at least we’re only down one
devils,lxist75,2024-11-16 19:57:20,40 miles left. This year they’ve been coming out swinging after being down a period so I have hope
devils,lxisvrf,2024-11-16 19:57:47,Hey so uhhh can the refs stop getting in the way please? Thanks
devils,lxisy29,2024-11-16 19:58:10,A second period against Tampa. Let’s change the narrative boys.
devils,lxit20u,2024-11-16 19:58:52,Meh that was not ideal. I thought they played well up until the Tampa power play which gave them life. Still a lot of game left but this team is such a damn thorn for them. Hope they can dig deep but I didn’t come into this game with high expectations other than don’t get hurt and don’t get embarrassed like that first game against them.
devils,lxit5kg,2024-11-16 19:59:30,We have a Luke on a Toque but have you ever seen Palat on a Press Box?
devils,lxivanq,2024-11-16 20:13:01,Marty’s better  
devils,lxivyrd,2024-11-16 20:17:18,Kucherov...always doing scumbag plays whether thats late hits or fire pucks once the whistle is blown
devils,lxivzqm,2024-11-16 20:17:28,Investigate these refs. 
devils,lxixoom,2024-11-16 20:28:13,Ok I need their goalie to not be so locked in. He can think of it as birthday gift for Cotter
devils,lxixtug,2024-11-16 20:29:05,Tampa definitely seems to have our number but the difference is definitely their goalie.gotta get a dirty fucking goal to even it up here.
devils,lxiy69k,2024-11-16 20:31:13,That goes in on us
devils,lxiyg3c,2024-11-16 20:32:55,Luke is hungry for a goal. I hope he gets one.
devils,lxiyo1w,2024-11-16 20:34:19,Lightning could easily have 4 if not for Marky
devils,lxiyod4,2024-11-16 20:34:22,Markstrom keeping them in it
devils,lxiyos7,2024-11-16 20:34:26,Teams clueless rn…where’s that meme that says “do something” and someone is poking something with a stick.
devils,lxiypbx,2024-11-16 20:34:32,Jack can't keep the damn puck on his stick!
devils,lxiypfu,2024-11-16 20:34:33,Markstrom saving their asses. Shame if they can’t get a goddamn goal.
devils,lxiys93,2024-11-16 20:35:02,Marky is playing out of his goddamn mind. By all rights Tampa should be up by 4 right now.
devils,lxiztpo,2024-11-16 20:41:32,Imagine Bryce talking shit about soccer like that with Cangi in the booth lmao
devils,lxj02rv,2024-11-16 20:43:08,This a game where they just need to be pests. They need to swarm the net and just start firing shots.
devils,lxj037j,2024-11-16 20:43:12,Atp just bring out Kermit
devils,lxj0b9m,2024-11-16 20:44:37,this game is a good test. its clear Tampa watched tape on us and have figured us out but can Keefe and the boys adjust on the fly mid-game?
devils,lxj0r3q,2024-11-16 20:47:23,Man put Luke in.
devils,lxj0urq,2024-11-16 20:48:02,Mercer in the slot...looking to pass....
devils,lxj170h,2024-11-16 20:50:12,Meier has to try something else there he had a wide open lane.
devils,lxj18c6,2024-11-16 20:50:26, I am humbly requesting a Timo goal or a text back I’ll take either
devils,lxj19uw,2024-11-16 20:50:43,fuck me. Vasilevskiy just let them score!
devils,lxj228v,2024-11-16 20:55:45,Just feeling like one of those nights but then again Kucherov almost got an own goal
devils,lxj2iia,2024-11-16 20:58:39,Have to credit Tampa’s defense. None of our chances looked very high danger.
devils,lxj4xhl,2024-11-16 21:14:31,Brutal…..
devils,lxj4yny,2024-11-16 21:14:44,:(
devils,lxj57r8,2024-11-16 21:16:23,This team just isn’t consistent with their efforts…so frustrating.  This is a Tampa team that has lost 4 of their last 5…god forbid we could keep playing like we have been.
devils,lxj5trc,2024-11-16 21:20:23,Lightning are a bunch of crybaby bitches no? Kuch Hedman now Hagel
devils,lxj631l,2024-11-16 21:22:04,Only way I see us scoring is a chance or tip in from the blue line but we've been allergic to that all game
devils,lxj6ali,2024-11-16 21:23:28,We should learn from Tampa. I think we learned from Panthers how to beat a team like that. We matched their intensity. We need to beat the structure of the lightning.
devils,lxj6ent,2024-11-16 21:24:14,Ok I must of missed what happened. It just looked like he lost his footing
devils,lxj6fkq,2024-11-16 21:24:25,What a flop kuch can suck a dick

devils,lxj6vfx,2024-11-16 21:27:22,Sigh beat Carolina and Washington and put this game behind us
devils,lxj6wyx,2024-11-16 21:27:39,Not our night
devils,lxj6x7u,2024-11-16 21:27:41,Yeah I don’t think this is our night
devils,lxj6zh5,2024-11-16 21:28:07,Damn. That's probably all she wrote. I'll still happily leave Florida with 4 points.
devils,lxj74hd,2024-11-16 21:29:03,I can’t fucking stand the lightning man. So many scumbags with such punchable faces.
devils,lxj77wt,2024-11-16 21:29:40,I wanted at least some revenge for the first game but 4/6 points and spanking the reigning champs is good enough for me. And there's still 11 minutes left so who knows
devils,lxj79ib,2024-11-16 21:29:57,almost paid and drove 4 hours to watch this game and i’m a little happy i couldn’t afford it. i wouldn’t want to watch no goals but the boys
devils,lxj8b4k,2024-11-16 21:36:51,Unrelated worry but i have a bad feeling the Canes are gunna get Blackwood and hes gunna turn into Roy 2.0 against us 6 times a year.
devils,lxj96fy,2024-11-16 21:42:39,Good job Luke keeping pace so Markstrom wasn't on his own
devils,lxja1oq,2024-11-16 21:48:24,There's a bug or something that just came into frame that I thought was the puck for a second even though Dougie still had it lol
devils,lxja5hb,2024-11-16 21:49:07,Can’t score on a 6-4 to avoid this shutout come on man
devils,lxjabfh,2024-11-16 21:50:14,Luke's thinking with portals lol
devils,lxiqvzv,2024-11-16 19:45:29,FuckI don't think we're fucked but fuck
devils,lxitmbp,2024-11-16 20:02:27,![gif](giphy|RKS1pHGiUUZ2g)watching that 1st period
devils,lxjas0e,2024-11-16 21:53:17,4 points on this trip they “won the series” thinking in baseball terms. I’ll take it. Doomers gonna doom.
devils,lxi7abf,2024-11-16 17:44:30,No Devils game after tonight until Thursday. Would love to see the boys keep chugging like they did against the Panthers.
devils,lxj3wl6,2024-11-16 21:07:43,Tampa here just wanted to pop in say genuinely happy for you guys that you seem to have finally gotten your goalie problem sorted it out. Seems like its been a problem in flux for you guys since Marty retired.
devils,lxj4e3p,2024-11-16 21:10:58,okay we're manifesting.I'm asking for a defenseman goal past Vasilevskiy to tie it all up.
devils,lxi18lo,2024-11-16 17:09:51,LGD!
devils,lxigw8e,2024-11-16 18:44:00,I’ve had my gummy I’ve got my gin and juice bring on some Devils hockey on a Saturday night. Ruin the Lightning tonight boys! LFG

devils,lxikkum,2024-11-16 19:06:45,Really hoping for the boys to have a good game - having a really rough go of it and it would be nice for the boys to assist me out of the funk! LGD
devils,lxikze0,2024-11-16 19:09:13,Feels like other teams are starting to recognize we won’t be pushed around anymore and that there will be consequences for chippy BS.
devils,lxil9r1,2024-11-16 19:10:57,Taking the Mrs out to dinner for our Anniversary so I’m gonna miss most of this one. If the boys keep doing what they’ve been doing it’s going to be a good one! LGD!
devils,lxim58e,2024-11-16 19:16:16,Time to ground the Lightning 
devils,lxinarx,2024-11-16 19:23:26,Jack looking so much better past few games. Seems to be back to himself and what we know he can do

devils,lxiom8y,2024-11-16 19:31:29,Kinda surprised at all the icings so far lol
devils,lxiou2m,2024-11-16 19:32:50,Wow did anyone just see that guy flip dougie off in the box
devils,lxip1km,2024-11-16 19:34:08,Wow and I thought we passed too much!
devils,lxipev6,2024-11-16 19:36:25,wtf why is this not playing in espn+? Anyone able to watch via espn+? I hate having to use the sketchy sites
devils,lxiphsp,2024-11-16 19:36:55,Every time I look at Justin Dowling I think he’s Grant Marshall for a minute lol.
devils,lxiq8ji,2024-11-16 19:41:32,HUGE save by Marky there
devils,lxiqasc,2024-11-16 19:41:55,Markstrom say NO
devils,lxiqb6a,2024-11-16 19:41:59,big save by marky
devils,lxiqblr,2024-11-16 19:42:04,MARKY
devils,lxiqtr5,2024-11-16 19:45:06,That missed high five was embarrassing
devils,lxiqx2t,2024-11-16 19:45:40,Damn. Tampa’s passing is too good tonight
devils,lxiricq,2024-11-16 19:49:19,Tit injuries suck I miss our Dougie bombs
devils,lxirj0f,2024-11-16 19:49:26,I would like to have some offense at some point in this game
devils,lxisih7,2024-11-16 19:55:31,horrific turnover by Dilly there
devils,lxivlqi,2024-11-16 20:15:00,Man the Chinese place made hot and sour soup *hot* tonightLet's get this bread
devils,lxivvvy,2024-11-16 20:16:48,Kuch is such a whining baby
devils,lxivwrz,2024-11-16 20:16:57,Not a trip
devils,lxivxtf,2024-11-16 20:17:08,Dive
devils,lxivyf1,2024-11-16 20:17:14,Stop showing this goddamn Cadillac ad during play didn't even see what Haula didRev up the vuvuzella
devils,lxiw0us,2024-11-16 20:17:40,We need to start chucking some bodies
devils,lxiwwl8,2024-11-16 20:23:16,Give Cotter pp time for birthday goal
devils,lxiwzqe,2024-11-16 20:23:49,We have absolutely zero legs tonight.
devils,lxix2xc,2024-11-16 20:24:24,Might just be not our night
devils,lxix3z4,2024-11-16 20:24:34,Dougie needs his ice time cut in half
devils,lxix7k1,2024-11-16 20:25:13,Luke fucking perfect 1v2
devils,lxixb10,2024-11-16 20:25:51,Looking like they're skating in quicksand. Need to try and pick it up start laying the body to get some more room.
devils,lxixb4s,2024-11-16 20:25:52,I dunno guys I think that power play wasn’t too good.
devils,lxixb9n,2024-11-16 20:25:54,Yeah…Tampa are not letting us do shit
devils,lxixjor,2024-11-16 20:27:21,And now getting goalied
devils,lxiye9f,2024-11-16 20:32:37,Cmonnnnn we’ve earned an own goal in our favor
devils,lxiyhse,2024-11-16 20:33:14,Can we not hang on to the puck tonight?
devils,lxiynrk,2024-11-16 20:34:16,Jack....
devils,lxiyq94,2024-11-16 20:34:42,Holy cow
devils,lxiyu3m,2024-11-16 20:35:22,This looks like a Cory Schneider devils game right now
devils,lxiyu50,2024-11-16 20:35:22,What is it with them against Tampa? This could be like that other bad game if not for Markstrom right now.
devils,lxiz777,2024-11-16 20:37:39,I know the boys are tired but cmon you gotta have a save like that fire you up
devils,lxizds2,2024-11-16 20:38:47,Praying for them to tie it and get an OT point
devils,lxizmbv,2024-11-16 20:40:16,Some good skating by Pesce
devils,lxizwhc,2024-11-16 20:42:01,Stick in between his legs.  Seems fine...
devils,lxj023q,2024-11-16 20:43:00,Jack and his eternal battle with the bucket
devils,lxj0igp,2024-11-16 20:45:52,Nico with a good zone entry good early pass and then draws the penalty. That’s why he’s the captain. 
devils,lxj0kfs,2024-11-16 20:46:12,Nico is SO good at drawing these penalties for us ugh 
devils,lxj0rnk,2024-11-16 20:47:28,Tied up from behind aka holding
devils,lxj0ufy,2024-11-16 20:47:58,Oh Mercer you should've gone down there
devils,lxj1crk,2024-11-16 20:51:14,Mercer has an uncanny ability to receive a pass and never be in the proper position for another pass or a shot on net I don't know how that's possible. Literally facing the wrong way of the play almost every time
devils,lxj1eg5,2024-11-16 20:51:32,I really don’t like the sharp angle shot
devils,lxj4xbd,2024-11-16 21:14:29,I hate playing ketchup Bill
devils,lxj4yh4,2024-11-16 21:14:42,*Sigh*
devils,lxj57k5,2024-11-16 21:16:21,Just checked in on the score after dinner and saw it’s still the same. How the boys looking? We must’ve really pissed off Florida they’re currently destroying Winnipeg 5-0 lol.
devils,lxj5h3b,2024-11-16 21:18:06,Timo. Luke. Dougie. Would love a goal from any of ya
devils,lxj5h4b,2024-11-16 21:18:06,This feels like a scheduled loss. Still a lot of time left so let's see how they respond.
devils,lxj5rdn,2024-11-16 21:19:57,They just need 1 to give them life
devils,lxj6ohs,2024-11-16 21:26:04,Oh man that was a flop
devils,lxj6ord,2024-11-16 21:26:07,That was a soft trip...
devils,lxj6xfo,2024-11-16 21:27:44,ok well. Rip. I was being hopeful but I fear I was too optimistic here
devils,lxj75q4,2024-11-16 21:29:16,Unfortunately not the night for the devils. Don’t know if it’s a positive or negative but unless we grab one in this game our last three losses have been shutouts. Obviously never wanna be shut out but if the opposing goalie just plays solid then there isn’t much you can do about it
devils,lxj8k5y,2024-11-16 21:38:32,I think if Tampa pulls their goalie we have a shot.
devils,lxj9jds,2024-11-16 21:45:02,Bet MGM ad on gotham sports might be the most obnoxious thing ive ever seen and it plays every 3 ads
devils,lxjqsop,2024-11-16 23:46:49,This one is on me boys. I talked alot of shit since Thursday. I will do better
devils,lxj2i3t,2024-11-16 20:58:34,All y'all complaining about lack of energy kindly scroll up to the top of this thread and notice that we're leading in shots faceoff wins and hits. Those are not the marks of a low energy team. The difference is one goal. That's it. And not an inexcusable soft goal that Markstrom should've had. Just a goal. Nobody's rolling over. There's been some kinda *eh* moments but they're not beating themselves. This isn't the Wings game where we dominated and goaltending was bad. This isn't the last game against Tampa where the bottom fell out. This isn't the Sharks game where we threw the kitchen sink at Blackwood and got stonewalled. This is an evenly matched game that could go either way if we just get oneIn short relax
devils,lxirftm,2024-11-16 19:48:54,I really dislike Florida and everyone in that fucking state.
devils,lxj7hcj,2024-11-16 21:31:23,Why do we always play so shit vs tampa
devils,lxj1fx1,2024-11-16 20:51:47,Every time we get in a good shooting lane the shot is blocked. Their D has been amazing
devils,lxj4drw,2024-11-16 21:10:54,We might lose but we cannot get shutout our offense is too good to get shutout this often
devils,lxj1lib,2024-11-16 20:52:48,I’m getting San Jose vibes :(
devils,lxibuss,2024-11-16 18:12:26,Would be sweet to leave Florida with 6 of 6 points but I’d honestly be pretty happy with just an OT point tonight
devils,lxid9hz,2024-11-16 18:21:11,I’m an idiot and have a first date at 7:30. First game of the season I’ll miss. Kinda hoping it goes shitty so I can get back early
devils,lxiegfb,2024-11-16 18:28:41,Man I wish some metro dvision teams besides the devils would dyart losing. Jesus. Night after night I see every team in our division winning games
devils,lxifhej,2024-11-16 18:35:11,pls win
devils,lxiktty,2024-11-16 19:08:16,Win it for 2018.
devils,lximdpv,2024-11-16 19:17:45,Can someone let me know when this game starts. my streams aren't working
devils,lximdu8,2024-11-16 19:17:46,No Chinese food yet but yay puck drop
devils,lximiau,2024-11-16 19:18:32,Great start
devils,lximrpj,2024-11-16 19:20:09,I need everyone at MSG to stop playing this fucking Cadillac ad as games are happening
devils,lximw3c,2024-11-16 19:20:54,Is it my pirate stream or is there an insane amount of white noise on the broadcast today?
devils,lxin5w6,2024-11-16 19:22:35,Tough chance nothing Jack could do he had no space
devils,lxinuw4,2024-11-16 19:26:50,Hagel on the ice bear hugging a stick.  No respect for that little diver. 
devils,lxinwym,2024-11-16 19:27:11,4th line on the ice with Dougie and Dillon is nerve wracking
devils,lxiovbm,2024-11-16 19:33:03,Stupid penalty
devils,lxiowwe,2024-11-16 19:33:19,I agree dude.  Fuck the refs
devils,lxiq0uh,2024-11-16 19:40:12,penalty kill is so smexy
devils,lxiq85i,2024-11-16 19:41:27,What the hell is the random screaming in the crowd about?
devils,lxiqije,2024-11-16 19:43:14,How is that not a penalty?
devils,lxiqilw,2024-11-16 19:43:14,Kucherov apologized to Dillon? We got teams scared now
devils,lxiql65,2024-11-16 19:43:41,Wait you can be sent to the box for jumping the faceoff?
devils,lxiqltd,2024-11-16 19:43:47,Wow. Great effort from Pally
devils,lxiqmwc,2024-11-16 19:43:57,Good save Pally
devils,lxiqpds,2024-11-16 19:44:22,Merc-Dawg
devils,lxiqsqx,2024-11-16 19:44:56,Fuck
devils,lxiqtoj,2024-11-16 19:45:05,They were buzzin hard on that last 3 minutes.
devils,lxir0xq,2024-11-16 19:46:19,Team is struggling for several shifts in a row and gets scored on and Keefe sends out the make a wish 4th line when they need a response. Clever.
devils,lxira6f,2024-11-16 19:47:55,There needs to be some kind of explanation why some random teams always play better against us regardless of the coaching staff or player personnel
devils,lxirgek,2024-11-16 19:48:59,Looking like these refs have money on Tampa tonight. 
devils,lxis8kh,2024-11-16 19:53:48,I'm law just don't let Tampa score again and come back fighting in the 2nd
devils,lxisa8y,2024-11-16 19:54:05,Palat is an absolute play killer
devils,lxisigf,2024-11-16 19:55:30,That almost looked like Dougie got a bit of a punch to the face
devils,lxisk8y,2024-11-16 19:55:49,Don’t get going wide there with 10 on the clock take the rush and hope to get a shot off
devils,lxisp57,2024-11-16 19:56:38,Ok well they looked a bit sleepy but if they go to the locker room and snort some or jacks special crack he’s been on recently we can turn this around
devils,lxiss7s,2024-11-16 19:57:10,Tampa's forcheck is forcing the devils to scramble a bit. That was another rough turnover in the final minute that almost led to a goal. Fortunately it's still a 1 goal game. Need to adjust
devils,lxiundw,2024-11-16 20:08:58,The BetMGM ads are irritating
devils,lxivz86,2024-11-16 20:17:23,Soft
devils,lxiw0t4,2024-11-16 20:17:40,We got a soft call last game they get one this game. Power kill plz.
devils,lxiwfqi,2024-11-16 20:20:17,At least we should get the next pp. That's how officiating works.Edit: right on queue
devils,lxiwjkw,2024-11-16 20:20:58,Might need a little wake up call for the boys. Paging Dillon
devils,lxiwnbr,2024-11-16 20:21:37,We just look slow
devils,lxiwp2i,2024-11-16 20:21:56,Markstrom the only player showing up tonight
devils,lxiwp5q,2024-11-16 20:21:57,Markstrom keeping this competitive....
devils,lxiwpbs,2024-11-16 20:21:58,Jesus time for MacDermid to punch somebody
devils,lxiwpbt,2024-11-16 20:21:58,MARKSTROM
devils,lxix3sa,2024-11-16 20:24:33,Christ we had it there with that bratt opportunity
devils,lxix3xp,2024-11-16 20:24:34,Their PK looks better than our PP
devils,lxix4ap,2024-11-16 20:24:38,I'm not gonna lie I forgot we were on a pp for a second
devils,lxix6lf,2024-11-16 20:25:03,How did we not score there?
devils,lxix84a,2024-11-16 20:25:19,When you are on the PP and the other guys get more scoring chances...you are doing it wrong.
devils,lxixb70,2024-11-16 20:25:53,Defensive structure has been good and markys playing well but we got no juice on offense
devils,lxixjvx,2024-11-16 20:27:23,I fucking hate playing vasilevskiy
devils,lxixv3h,2024-11-16 20:29:18,https://preview.redd.it/jkustoz77d1e1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178c24a881e2b887286fdb04978cf626d87eb37b

devils,lxiynhd,2024-11-16 20:34:13,Goals for Markstrom
devils,lxiyu08,2024-11-16 20:35:21,This game is giving me Cory Schneider in net ptsd vibes. All those saves and no goal support 
devils,lxiyuts,2024-11-16 20:35:29,Markstrom is the only one showing up so far hes unreal rn
devils,lxiyuyw,2024-11-16 20:35:31,Who created this thread man geez I can't see any comments recent it's all old
devils,lxiz31c,2024-11-16 20:36:55,Everyone in their GDT is talking about Markstrom too. lol
devils,lxiz37w,2024-11-16 20:36:57,Some of the worst passing I've seen so far this year. It's like no one is playing with their heads up.
devils,lxiz8j3,2024-11-16 20:37:54,Why was there only like 2 of us near their net? If the others had gotten there we might have been able to get a couple shot attempts. We really need to have more hussle
devils,lxiz8lw,2024-11-16 20:37:55,Just get one
devils,lxj0dhi,2024-11-16 20:45:00,Tampa Bay's defense has been the deciding factor this game all 5 of their players are getting sticks in each and every lane and pickpocketing where they can
devils,lxj0idh,2024-11-16 20:45:51,DO NOT THE NICO
devils,lxj0k9m,2024-11-16 20:46:11,Let this powerplay please be better than the last one
devils,lxj0kzz,2024-11-16 20:46:19,lol what is Hedman complaining about?
devils,lxj0qbi,2024-11-16 20:47:15,I am once again asking is there anything Nico can't do?
devils,lxj0t7c,2024-11-16 20:47:45,Fucking Vasi didn't even flinch man damn
devils,lxj0xj2,2024-11-16 20:48:31,Fuck you Vasi
devils,lxj11yp,2024-11-16 20:49:19,Tampa Bay is very good at getting in passing lanes and shooting lanes and being disruptive. They’re also very good at tying up players without drawing penalties 
devils,lxj13wt,2024-11-16 20:49:40,Mercer was just dying to pass that perfect setup in the slot
devils,lxj15qb,2024-11-16 20:49:58,2nd half of that pp was pretty good
devils,lxj18hq,2024-11-16 20:50:28,We finally showed life at least. Build off that!
devils,lxj2o90,2024-11-16 20:59:41,Anyone else watching on the gotham app and seeing the same “Bettor Half” commercial with insanely loud dubstep track over and over and over again? Its driving me insane!!
devils,lxj4zv3,2024-11-16 21:14:58,Well fuck.
devils,lxj50ua,2024-11-16 21:15:08,god fucking dammit.
devils,lxj517c,2024-11-16 21:15:12,Wel thats a bummer
devils,lxj51gu,2024-11-16 21:15:15,The fuck
devils,lxj51qe,2024-11-16 21:15:18,That’s not what I wanted
devils,lxj56vh,2024-11-16 21:16:13,All the signs pointed to the momentum going the other way
devils,lxj5ktd,2024-11-16 21:18:46,Can we please just get the one goal in?
devils,lxj5nro,2024-11-16 21:19:18,Ok good job Nico. Here we go. We get one back now tie it up in the last minute and win in OT.
devils,lxj5o5b,2024-11-16 21:19:22,Come on boys. We NEED this
devils,lxj62u3,2024-11-16 21:22:02,Yeah just not our night.
devils,lxj6bjp,2024-11-16 21:23:39,What’s different between tonight and the Panthers games
devils,lxj6elq,2024-11-16 21:24:13,Jesus its a frustrating night. Canes next on a long break hope they come better prepared.
devils,lxj6h7v,2024-11-16 21:24:43,JFC… not what we needed right now. Sigh.
devils,lxj6lis,2024-11-16 21:25:31,I don't mind losing but developing a nasty habit of getting shutout.
devils,lxj6yut,2024-11-16 21:28:00,That'll probably do us.
devils,lxj7gss,2024-11-16 21:31:17,Nobody on the devils played great tonight.
devils,lxj8dua,2024-11-16 21:37:22,That sums it up prime turnover and the offense throws it into them.
devils,lxj9uli,2024-11-16 21:47:05,Such an annoying game
devils,lxk40yf,2024-11-17 01:37:33,There are still positives to focus on. I think our biggest issue tonight was passing we were making terrible passes all night and they just so happened to have Vasilevsky standing on his head and a great pk. But despite all that markstrom stood tall most of the game and made good saves and our defense was overall not as bad as the scoresheet shows. Well come back from this
devils,lxiqsj1,2024-11-16 19:44:54,Dougie..so soft and slow
devils,lxisrf6,2024-11-16 19:57:02,Tampa has to be in their heads these plays they have not been made until this game with awful random turnovers
devils,lxj1jv7,2024-11-16 20:52:30,Looks like we’re having a strong defensive game but struggling on even strength.
devils,lxj2uga,2024-11-16 21:00:50,It might just take a goal to at least get this to OT and a point. I hate that feeling that they might not get it. It’s like feast or famine with the offense.
devils,lxj70zi,2024-11-16 21:28:24,Fact:  TB had more energy from puck drop.  They took away time and space.  Devils were a step behind all night.  So...the result is predictable.
devils,lxjafo7,2024-11-16 21:51:01,Shutout 2 times in 4 games is not good.
devils,lxj1obo,2024-11-16 20:53:18,Please don’t get shut out again *knocks on wood*
devils,lxj6nrc,2024-11-16 21:25:56,Just can’t win 3 in a row. Some kind of mental block
devils,lxj71hg,2024-11-16 21:28:30,I am sorry the goals have been bad
devils,lxj7c59,2024-11-16 21:30:26,Tampa Bay Carolina and Washington. The three old mid teams that always beat us.
devils,lxj96n3,2024-11-16 21:42:41,This game makes the sharks loss more relevant. Those are the games we should win to make up for a loss like this
devils,lxj1fui,2024-11-16 20:51:46,This is just a question of matching and then exceeding their energy level....
devils,lxj1raz,2024-11-16 20:53:51,Don’t think Vasi is going to give up anything obvious.
devils,lxj4t87,2024-11-16 21:13:44,I'm begging any deity that'll listen to please let the accumulated Chinese food gas to pass pleaseLet's get a goal
devils,lxj51ca,2024-11-16 21:15:14,Well that’s probably game. Once again Tampa just owns us
devils,lxj7gxq,2024-11-16 21:31:18,How do we consistently have problems with Tampa Bay? Is it just their play style or is there something more to it?
devils,lxisit6,2024-11-16 19:55:34,Horrible period for the Devils!
devils,lxj6xv9,2024-11-16 21:27:49,4 of 6 possible points on a Florida road trip. That’s pretty damn good.
devils,lxj63ik,2024-11-16 21:22:10,Come on people so what Tampa plays us tight and the fans just give up?  This is the shit that drives me crazy when we’re home.  We go quiet when things don’t go our way.  We expect energy from the team ALL the time we should have it ourselves EVEN ON OUR COUCHES OR AT THE BAR OR WHEREVER YOU ARE!!!  LET’S GO DEVILS!!!!
devils,lxj8ogl,2024-11-16 21:39:20,I blocked a bunch of doomers after the SJ game and lo and behold the same people are out dooming again tn 
devils,lxiggf3,2024-11-16 18:41:16,Sports betting just became legal in NC where I live and I mainly only bet on football but i don’t understand how the devils are -115 and the TB is -105. Is that just a typo?
devils,lxihtmd,2024-11-16 18:49:46,Any idea why we haven't put Lazar on LTIR if he's gonna be out long term? I'm not really concerned about accruing his 1m of cap space but LTIR feels like the move for him no?Also wondering what if any moves we see made during the break until next game to shore up the 4th line. Maybe we get a Bastian update maybe we see a winger called up
devils,lxik4su,2024-11-16 19:04:01,Bill looks like he hasn’t got much sleep lately
devils,lxilbmv,2024-11-16 19:11:16,Is the game on Hulu if you’re out of market? Not seeing it
devils,lxim1zu,2024-11-16 19:15:44,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDRZmTFh6xQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDRZmTFh6xQ)
devils,lximb79,2024-11-16 19:17:18,Random comment but is it me or is it disappointing that fans never get the hats that the players get? Whether its Adidas or fanatics..fans seems to get the cheap down version hats and look terrible...anyway LGD
devils,lximh0v,2024-11-16 19:18:19,Marty’s better
devils,lximh9x,2024-11-16 19:18:21,great starting shift! coming out real strong! keep at it!
devils,lximm5c,2024-11-16 19:19:11,Need to know how Rachel achieves that level of volume for her hair
devils,lximpy5,2024-11-16 19:19:50,Cooper finally looks like he has slightly aged
devils,lximsp3,2024-11-16 19:20:19,Anyone having picture issues? On fios and it’s stuttering a lot
devils,lximycx,2024-11-16 19:21:18,Luke brought him down by complete accident
devils,lxin58x,2024-11-16 19:22:29,Random question- is Gritsyuk 100% coming this season?
devils,lxin8r9,2024-11-16 19:23:05,Passes are a little off so far but hard to find fault with pretty much anything else. Guys came to play
devils,lxindck,2024-11-16 19:23:52,Word salad Bryce
devils,lxinels,2024-11-16 19:24:05,Those Tampa Bay alt jerseys are ugly
devils,lxinhxl,2024-11-16 19:24:39,heater time boys lets go
devils,lxinj36,2024-11-16 19:24:51,you could feel dano’s heart sink lol
devils,lxinpo4,2024-11-16 19:25:58,Fuck yeah Jesper hustle plays on D
devils,lxinu9z,2024-11-16 19:26:44,how we playing? can’t watch bc of black outs
devils,lxinyah,2024-11-16 19:27:25,Think we got a lucky call going our way with that icing
devils,lxio21q,2024-11-16 19:28:03,So many icings lol
devils,lxio44a,2024-11-16 19:28:25,Glad they shouted out the Timo Wedge™
devils,lxiouvp,2024-11-16 19:32:58,Ok let's kill this
devils,lxiovl1,2024-11-16 19:33:06,uhh dougie what was that
devils,lxiovlm,2024-11-16 19:33:06,Oh DouglasIt's ok let's kill this kill
devils,lxiovvu,2024-11-16 19:33:09,okay gotta kill this penalty boys!
devils,lxj8okq,2024-11-16 21:39:21,5th game in 8 days technically
devils,lxj8z8v,2024-11-16 21:41:19,How does that happen?
devils,lxj8v2j,2024-11-16 21:40:33,People were way too hard on him.
devils,lxj8cv4,2024-11-16 21:37:11,On top of an overseas start
devils,lxj8lea,2024-11-16 21:38:46,They also just mentioned this is Tampa's 2nd game in 9 days. This is our 5th game in that same span. Very weird.
devils,lxjasqs,2024-11-16 21:53:25,You could have had a 29 save shutout tonight
devils,lxirjbp,2024-11-16 19:49:29,We're really not. It's a pretty even game and the goal was through a screen. It happens
devils,lxiu4nk,2024-11-16 20:05:39,Would be a shame to lose today 4 days off coming up would be nice to end the road trip with a win. Especially with Carolina waiting on Thu
devils,lxj9t86,2024-11-16 21:46:50,It’s weird but a byproduct of the global series and Prudential being one of the busiest arenas in the US. It’ll honestly help us in the last half of the season playing a little less while everyone is getting gassed at the important games.Just can’t be dropping games like this and the Sharks though.
devils,lxj7spz,2024-11-16 21:33:27,I don't understand how anyone watching this game thinks it's been low energy. The first was a little slow but this has been very evenly played. Obviously goals are the difference but neither team has dominated
devils,lxipspd,2024-11-16 19:38:48,I'm glad they will have a 4 day game break.
devils,lxiysdz,2024-11-16 20:35:04,They seem tired...
devils,lxj2wmq,2024-11-16 21:01:14,As much as I like seeing Timo being the trigger man on PP2 those one timers are never gonna beat Vasi clean glove side.
devils,lxj6dlw,2024-11-16 21:24:02,thats why i low key want seamus back
devils,lxipebd,2024-11-16 19:36:19,His girlfriend’s wearing a rangers jersey. Nothing says rent free like getting glass seats to go watch your rivals
devils,lxivhu7,2024-11-16 20:14:19,He hasn’t had to do much this game yet to be fair
devils,lxiyfdo,2024-11-16 20:32:48,He's been bubbling for a couple games. That goal is coming!
devils,lxj2tlo,2024-11-16 21:00:40,I just saw that what a terrible hit
devils,lxj6npk,2024-11-16 21:25:55,No idea
devils,lxj6vw3,2024-11-16 21:27:27,I DONT LIKE IT
devils,lxjaivu,2024-11-16 21:51:36,They literally got shutout by the sharks prior to the Florida games lol. 
devils,lxipv8t,2024-11-16 19:39:13,Remember the trap years?  Boring as fuck but loved every minute of it
devils,lxj0ul5,2024-11-16 20:48:00,Been thinking this too. He’s had some amazing last few games. Dougie is getting too much ice time atm imo
devils,lxj0zqn,2024-11-16 20:48:55,He didn't have a clean shot he was just about tripped and probably would've drawn another penalty if he went down
devils,lxj5cua,2024-11-16 21:17:19,They're always a tough team to play though not only are they good on D they've got goaltending too.
devils,lxie6t0,2024-11-16 18:27:01,They’re due for a  sbreak. They Still have played the most games out of any team sorry about typing but I’m using a fucking IPAD and it’s impossible to communitcate in
devils,lxj42d6,2024-11-16 21:08:47,If yours could not be perfect for a couple of minutes it'd be great to make this game interesting :D.Edit: Also thanks. We still get stressed by them though..
devils,lxj4365,2024-11-16 21:08:56,Well...Allen is a UFA next year and Markstrom the year after lol. So we'll see what happens? I guess? Thanks tho lol
devils,lxj4sxa,2024-11-16 21:13:40,Ideally Douglas. Please hockey gods 
devils,lxiowiq,2024-11-16 19:33:15,Oh ya lol
devils,lxiplr2,2024-11-16 19:37:37,I’m watching on ESPN+
devils,lxippd2,2024-11-16 19:38:13,Having to watch the Tampa feed.  Consider yourself lucky.  Fucking blacked out on espn + even though I live 350 miles away.  Fuck you Gary
devils,lxiw53k,2024-11-16 20:18:26,At Tampa or the refs?
devils,lxj24u4,2024-11-16 20:56:13,Me either but tampa does a good job of clogging the lanes
devils,lxj5gbm,2024-11-16 21:17:58,Even though we just coughed up another we're still pretty competitive tilt has been leaning in Tampa's favor since like halfway through the 2nd though.
devils,lxj938i,2024-11-16 21:42:03,They are very good at clogging up the middle against us.
devils,lxj1x6i,2024-11-16 20:54:51,Can't believe fucking Blackwood shut us out!
devils,lxif3vj,2024-11-16 18:32:47,I want the last game against Tampa to be avenged. Make them sweat the whole way
devils,lxidw7y,2024-11-16 18:25:11,Look just cancel on her or him. And be honest say ‘sorry but I messed upthe devils game is on can we reschedule?’ Any good man or woman would understand
devils,lxiece3,2024-11-16 18:27:59,Pick a place that will show the game. Or change to a place that will show the game. They'll understand. And if they don't they ain't a real one
devils,lxifog1,2024-11-16 18:36:25, It feels like they cannot lose right now but as long as the devils keep winning it won’t matter. Atlantic is filled with bubble teams this year 4th in the metro  could still be making the playoffs with a comfortable cushion.
devils,lxin1q3,2024-11-16 19:21:52,What stream working for you?
devils,lxit1pv,2024-11-16 19:58:49,DJ Pauly C should spin up some good tunes for them.
devils,lxiuxmn,2024-11-16 20:10:44,All the gambling ads are becoming infuriating.
devils,lxj6ngs,2024-11-16 21:25:53,Tampa Bay has better defense and goaltending. Panthers relentless forecheck and fast breakout is their A game but collapse in their zone (including their streaky goaltending).
devils,lxj6e4o,2024-11-16 21:24:08,Power play successes
devils,lxj6dy1,2024-11-16 21:24:06,Energy
devils,lxj6pkv,2024-11-16 21:26:17,I mean we don't lose points for getting shutout. It sucks but doesn't change a loss being a loss
devils,lxiqy0m,2024-11-16 19:45:49,Ref got in his way.
devils,lxj1rt7,2024-11-16 20:53:56,Offense*
devils,lxj32k1,2024-11-16 21:02:19,That's pretty typical with offense. That's why defense wins championships.
devils,lxj6yog,2024-11-16 21:27:58,If you win 2 and lose 1 for the whole year you win the cup 
devils,lxj71kw,2024-11-16 21:28:31,They’ve won 3 in a row. They beat the Panthers twice they’ve played a ton of games and had a lot of travel and a decent run. I’m not going to go nuts over this loss.
devils,lxj78kb,2024-11-16 21:29:47,Sorry to be that guy but we LITERALLY just won 3 in a row last week lol
devils,lxj86sg,2024-11-16 21:36:03,Carolina 1000% not mid. Tampa is an empire in decline but seems to find it whenever they play us Washington is 100% mid but they’ve played really well so far. Not sure they can last a full season.
devils,lxj7xbh,2024-11-16 21:34:17,It’s almost like experienced veteran teams know how to win
devils,lxj99yb,2024-11-16 21:43:18,Ironically both shutouts.
devils,lxiirkv,2024-11-16 18:55:36,Not a typo the book just expects the same amount of money to be bet on each team because it’s such a close matchup that they need to give minus odds on both teams in order to make sure they come out on top
devils,lxj9bva,2024-11-16 21:43:39,NJD v. Everybody (the league hates us confirmed)
devils,lxj32f4,2024-11-16 21:02:18,Luke is hungry for some offense too. Hopefully it would give him an edge cause he's so driven right now.
devils,lxiecn2,2024-11-16 18:28:01,Lol. iPad typing is tough.
devils,lxipumq,2024-11-16 19:39:07,Yeah I have to watch the lightning feed on stream east. I live in jax and it’s blacked out. I even tried a VPN from tx Toronto etc
devils,lxiwb22,2024-11-16 20:19:28,Why not both?
devils,lxie91h,2024-11-16 18:27:25,I cancelled on her once already for the game against Edmonton 
devils,lxiekna,2024-11-16 18:29:25,Might just have to stream on Sportsnet+ and keep the phone down on the seat
devils,lxin89o,2024-11-16 19:23:00,NHL66 dot ir
devils,lxj6ihi,2024-11-16 21:24:58,Not an energy issue
devils,lxj2gz2,2024-11-16 20:58:22,I would t be too quick to blame the O. They haven’t been amazing but they haven’t been too bad either. Tampa D is killing it and Vassy is demonstrating why he’s one of the best in the league.
devils,lxj7fmx,2024-11-16 21:31:04,Facts
devils,lxif5qd,2024-11-16 18:33:07,This mothafucka is ice cold
devils,lxifgqj,2024-11-16 18:35:04,Cancel again so we get another...I'm not gonna say the word but it starts with S
devils,lxhxit0,2024-11-16 16:49:20,I have it on xbox.. used to be decent but playing online nowadays has humbled me. Pretty sure we can game via crossplay! Just turned 30 so I should make the cut lmao
devils,lxiqzhj,2024-11-16 19:46:05,I haven’t played online in a while but I might be down. Feel free to DM me.
devils,lxiznxv,2024-11-16 20:40:32,Hey trust we know how it be online lol but down to play and try to win and if we can play cross-play I'm down I'm assuming we would have to add each other thru EA
devils,lxj8huw,2024-11-16 21:38:06,Ps5 or Xbox?

bluejackets,lxrlbmd,2024-11-18 10:16:39,I was gonna take a train up to Boston to see the Jackets play there next month. $140 for the cheapest seat is insane lol. I think I’ll pass. I’ll just take the 2 1/2 hr drive down to Philly the weekend before.
bluejackets,lxsoprn,2024-11-18 13:39:18,A win would be nice but expectations are low.
bluejackets,lxrue6a,2024-11-18 11:05:38,Hey we get Swayman tonight not the backup!*looks at Swaymans numbers* Hey we get the backup!Edit: apparently the Bruins are all excited because he has a 4-0-0 record against us? He got pulled last year for Ullmark when we were playing him because we lit him up. I guess we aren’t counting that.
bluejackets,lxrjs91,2024-11-18 10:07:57,I wanna watch Olivier thump Marchand a good time or two :)
bluejackets,lxsfocd,2024-11-18 12:53:52,I think this is a pretty important game to get a sense of if this new version of the team is actually progressing. They played one of their worst games of the season against Montreal. Now we get to see if they are able to come back and have energy and discipline to right the ship. Win or lose is not super important tbh but I think going out and looking like we belong will go a long way to convincing everyone that things are different from Vincent now.
bluejackets,lxtgamr,2024-11-18 15:58:25,Damn we almost got to see Korpi play. Miss that handsome fella everyday.
bluejackets,lxrildd,2024-11-18 10:01:08,HNNNGGG
bluejackets,lxrjca3,2024-11-18 10:05:26,There are some games where a tie feels like win.
bluejackets,lxu5bxy,2024-11-18 18:09:35,Jiricek in. Some funky looking forward lines.
bluejackets,lxua9lq,2024-11-18 18:38:10,"Please let us shit the bed less than we did with Montreal now that we've gotten some sleep. Thanku. Also I'm so glad it's Swayman means Magikorp can't have an ""oh yeah? Well fuck *you*"" game against us lol"
bluejackets,lxub3vx,2024-11-18 18:43:03,How come they're having Danforth play center instead of Sillinger?  Will Silly be 3C again once KJ returns?
bluejackets,lxrsjwc,2024-11-18 10:55:52,Philly’s a great spot to catch a game too. Even if the concourse ceiling is weirdly low.
bluejackets,lxtwi7n,2024-11-18 17:21:14,applicable comment for literally the last several years
bluejackets,lxrxw8h,2024-11-18 11:24:02,Yeah I figured I’d finally check it off my list. Looks nice from the pics I’ve seen from it online. NJ’s my closest arena but iirc we only play the Devils there once on like a Wednesday night and I work during the week :/.
bluejackets,lxodnh4,2024-11-17 19:11:55,The way you say “according to mark Scheig” makes it seem like it could be up for debate? It’s a fact Denton is tied for 5th with 5 others at 16 points.
bluejackets,lxocjcn,2024-11-17 19:05:27,Back to back game winners in overtime.
bluejackets,lxocm4l,2024-11-17 19:05:52,Don is gonna have to make a roster move when they activate Kent from the IR. Sending Jirichek down makes the most sense since he has options.
bluejackets,lxoi11n,2024-11-17 19:36:49,He still has a way to go on his defensive game since he has a tendency to play the puck aggressively and get caught with the play behind him but he's so confident and drives the offense so effectively! It's great to see the coaches trust him to be a part of this too. Honestly hope Jiricek gets another stint in Cleveland just so they both can be on the ice at the same time
bluejackets,lxojwc9,2024-11-17 19:47:52,Dude looks that good.
bluejackets,lxokag4,2024-11-17 19:50:12,Could be mistaken but I believe he is also first among D-men and second for first year AHLers
bluejackets,lxop1gk,2024-11-17 20:19:02,Seriously. According to…the stats? 
bluejackets,lxsnv6g,2024-11-18 13:35:01,Brian Hedger says he has 2 points
bluejackets,lxpo2cn,2024-11-18 00:11:17,Fair enough.  Probably should’ve thought that one through.   It was more or less one of those situations where I figured we’ve already been bummed out about enough this season that anything uplifting might be nice to post here.   Watching this kid and Cleveland in general has been one of those bright points imo.
bluejackets,lxopkoj,2024-11-17 20:22:18,I assume he might do something with Pyyhtia too if Johnson is drawing in. It’s not a big deal if JVR is a healthy scratch but it seems stupid to scratch him if he can go to Cleveland.
bluejackets,lxpe7nt,2024-11-17 22:58:56,I agree. I’m in Cleveland and have noticed some bonehead plays where he overcommitted but I am glad to see how well he’s been playing in the last week. I wouldn’t mind seeing Jiricek again if he has his head on straight. I’d rather see guys play in Cleveland than sit in Columbus.
bluejackets,lxpmgdu,2024-11-17 23:58:35,Yeah 1 point in 17 games I've seen enough. Guy plays hard D but doesn't look like an NHL guy. You gotta produce at least at an Aston Reese pace to stick as a grinder.
bluejackets,lxpff8f,2024-11-17 23:07:28,Yep it’s part of why the AHL is there and that ice time can really make a difference. It’ll be exciting to see where Mateychuk is at in 2-3 years! I think Jiricek can still be a force and a legit star. Since he’s only turning 21 I wish there was more patience for him from the fanbase and from himself as well. There’s a lot of pressure on his end to succeed and it’s gotta be tough seeing others taking spots ahead of him a few times this season
bluejackets,lxpg13a,2024-11-17 23:11:51,If he ends up in Cleveland I hope they keep him here for the rest of the season. I hate seeing guys going up play one game sit for 4 or 5 then have a bad game. Then everyone complains that he isn’t doing well. That would always happen with Korpi.
bluejackets,lxphmys,2024-11-17 23:23:17,Agreed if they aren’t playing and don’t need waivers send em to the Monsters! Asset mismanagement seemed too frequent the last few years due to injuries and the previous regime throwing everyone at the wall and seeing who sticks. Never knew who would be called up and be missing for months at a time haha
bluejackets,lxjevde,2024-11-16 22:20:37,I know this team will lose.  No issues with that.   But there is losing and there is getting your teeth kicked.  We were losing after 2.  We got our teeth kicked in after 3.
bluejackets,lxjocpu,2024-11-16 23:27:48,Preds fan > Here’s a little secret about dante fabbro’s time in nashville: he was pretty good nearly the entire time he should not have been healthy scratched constantly for a year and he should not have been waivedI think he looks pretty good out there. Out of our dumpster of defenseman he’s not the one making the worst mistakes
bluejackets,lxjg5sn,2024-11-16 22:29:21,Shitty result but thoroughly enjoyed Olivier being an absolute beast.
bluejackets,lxja09e,2024-11-16 21:48:08,Ugh
bluejackets,lxja5kd,2024-11-16 21:49:08,That 3rd period was easily the worst 20 minutes of hockey we've played all season. Dean Evason is probably going to have fun with these upcoming practices because that was Pascal Vincent levels of structure there. I don't know if the win yesterday started making guys think they could slack a little bit or something but it's flat out embarrassing how that happens against Montreal of all teams.
bluejackets,lxjb4e7,2024-11-16 21:55:34,Moral victories. We beat the socks off the penguins and made the city of Pittsburgh cry. A lot of impact players and parts of the leadership group are out with long term injuries. The kids can get extra development and playing time under Evason. This season was always going to be hard to salvage before the puck even dropped. Future is still bright. Brightest it’s ever been for the Columbus Blueprint Jackets.
bluejackets,lxjajul,2024-11-16 21:51:48,Can we stop sucking huge moose dcks when we play on the Road? Did we win this year on the road at least once? We just made Montreal looking like cup contender 
bluejackets,lxja7ip,2024-11-16 21:49:30,1. I think Tarasov is done. I had hopes but he’s done.2. More than half these defensemen stink. Actively making the team worse. I hope Waddell thinks about that before attempting to move on from Jiricek.
bluejackets,lxjivjq,2024-11-16 22:47:50,Aww nuts
bluejackets,lxk7wpy,2024-11-17 02:15:34,Of all the games I’ve watched this was definitely one of them.
bluejackets,lxlhtcv,2024-11-17 09:34:23,Provorov and Severson has back to back worst passes I have ever
bluejackets,lxje2oe,2024-11-16 22:15:20,Damn we let Xhekaj get a point against us? We are bad
bluejackets,lxj9xj9,2024-11-16 21:47:38,Bag skate them.Unacceptable.
bluejackets,lxjhmlg,2024-11-16 22:39:29,This team plays great at NWA. They are 1-6-2 away from NWA.
bluejackets,lxje1m2,2024-11-16 22:15:08,Severson is useless what a nice parting gift of a contract from Jarmo
bluejackets,lxl898a,2024-11-17 08:27:10,The team jet’s cabin air system needs to be deep cleaned clearly.  Maybe just sell the plane and switch it out.  Actually how about just win on the road or we are changing to a team bus.  No more cushy travel.
bluejackets,lxnwc9o,2024-11-17 17:31:25,Denton fucking Mateychuck just send Bruins fans home unhappy for the second straight night. Damn we might be onto something here.
bluejackets,lxja27y,2024-11-16 21:48:30,Habs fans gonna be so insufferable. Seriously though. Wtf Severson.
bluejackets,lxjbhqt,2024-11-16 21:58:02,Where's Jean Luc and Brian?
bluejackets,lxjb1xb,2024-11-16 21:55:06,Glad I couldn't watch tonight.However last night I knew this game would be a stinker.
bluejackets,lxk2j42,2024-11-17 01:24:29,Step 1- get the russians out of the teamStep 2 …?Step 3 - Profit!
bluejackets,lxjkrnz,2024-11-16 23:01:06,Same. I do appreciate his fighting skills
bluejackets,lxjd30h,2024-11-16 22:08:43,Kept trying to tell people last season was not just some pascal Vincent disaster. Provorov and Severson playing lackadaisically and carelessly really hurts a young group that will make mistakes by virtue of their greenness already
bluejackets,lxjexfi,2024-11-16 22:21:00,Pretty sure it’s 0-5-2 on the road might be wrong though.
bluejackets,lxjafi8,2024-11-16 21:50:59,Tarasov didn't play that badly. The Suzuki goal was bad. Everything else was terrible defense. Plus he made some saves that probably should have went in.
bluejackets,lxjafr9,2024-11-16 21:51:02,The thing that is stupid is those defenseman have shown they know how to play well. They just are lazy. I’m bummed about Tarasov. This was his year to take the net.
bluejackets,lxjn7eo,2024-11-16 23:19:02,> Habs fans gonna be so insufferable. Hard to be upset when they're at the bottom of the Atlantic like they should be lmao.
bluejackets,lxjn9bn,2024-11-16 23:19:27,Selfish of you to know and not tell the team in advance.
bluejackets,lxlkbi0,2024-11-17 09:50:33,Provorov seems to be the only problem out of that group.
bluejackets,lxjehnr,2024-11-16 22:18:04,At least Evason and company have done a decent job of beating out some of the bad habits and getting the team to play solid in October. Now he needs to start tugging on the reins a little now that some guys think they can slip into the old ways and get away with it again.
bluejackets,lxl6rzy,2024-11-17 08:15:56,The team is bad but Pascal Vincent was also bad. Both can be true at the same time.
bluejackets,lxk0adf,2024-11-17 01:04:03,Pascal Vincent was absolutely a disaster  and combined with bad bad Larsen is a big reason jarmo is gone.
bluejackets,lxjgtxy,2024-11-16 22:33:59,We beat Colorado at Ball Arena over a month ago. I think that's it though.
bluejackets,lxjbkay,2024-11-16 21:58:30,He gave up 5 goals on 2.55 xG that’s not good. For comparison Montembeault gave up 1 goal on 2.45xG.
bluejackets,lxm1773,2024-11-17 11:28:25,Try playing with them and tell me how you enjoy the microclimate
bluejackets,lxjfy1p,2024-11-16 22:27:50,TBH I think a vet like provorov is harder to correct than a young guy I’m in favor of trading him whenever denton’s ready
bluejackets,lxjhapu,2024-11-16 22:37:12,Ahh right forgot that was a road game some how. 1-5-2 on the season?
bluejackets,lxjbqj8,2024-11-16 21:59:39,I wish I could possibly convey how little I gave a shit about imaginary stats honestly. I just watched him get absolutely hung out to dry in the third period with absolute atrocious defensive hockey.
bluejackets,lxm6hq8,2024-11-17 11:57:30,Oh sorry I'm not an NHL player I didn't realize you skated with them so frequently
bluejackets,lxowayj,2024-11-17 21:03:39,Yes everyone HATES Marchenko. Smiling is the WORST.
bluejackets,lxjgebk,2024-11-16 22:30:57,It's insane how many people are saying we should keep him and extend him in the summer. Dude was literally brought in here to try to get instant playoff success for us and be a stopgap for Mateychuk. He's in a contract year and playing under a new coach who actually knows what they're doing no shit he looks better now. He's trying to get a payday and I'm not in favor of being stuck with Severson contract number 2.
bluejackets,lxmm4fm,2024-11-17 13:23:28,There's no chance Provorov isn't gone at the trade deadline
bluejackets,lxm774r,2024-11-17 12:01:25,I hear you from a strictly contract POV but Provorov has been so much better than Severson so far this season.
bluejackets,lxjijto,2024-11-16 22:45:39,1-6-2 according to the team website. So even worse lol.
bluejackets,lxjcau0,2024-11-16 22:03:24,Too many giveaways especially from Provorov
bluejackets,lxjcoq6,2024-11-16 22:06:01,You could just look at the “real” stats and notice he’s one of the worst goalies in the league. I don’t know why it can’t be defensemen stinking and him stinking.
bluejackets,lxjgq4u,2024-11-16 22:33:16,And yet he drops absolute eggs like this game in spite of being in a contract year and having a new coach and the eye test tells me he’s comfortable doing low effort games
bluejackets,lxjmkwv,2024-11-16 23:14:26,Perfect!
bluejackets,lxje11n,2024-11-16 22:15:02,Severson and Provorov have been better this year. They're absolutely garbage together though. I never want to see them paired up again.
bluejackets,lxhtq39,2024-11-16 16:28:22,FTP forever
bluejackets,lxi2obe,2024-11-16 17:17:55,Forever!
bluejackets,lxip844,2024-11-16 19:35:16,And ever amen
bluejackets,lxg6h5l,2024-11-16 11:09:07,Congrats!
bluejackets,lxghki8,2024-11-16 12:09:28,I have. It took about a month roughly. Kind of frustrating but someone from CBJ will email you and ask if you have a Fanatics Sportsbook account. Once it’s confirmed Fanatics will deposit it into your account. You won’t get any confirmation so you’ll just have to keep checking. I got mine in 2 separate deposits which I don’t think was planned. I had to reach out to the CBJ rep and tell them I only had half but ended up getting the full $500 eventually. Congrats and hope you get yours much quicker!
bluejackets,lxgnrai,2024-11-16 12:42:27,My dad was the first person to be selected for this and he never got the money. He reached out and no one ever got back to him.
bluejackets,lxh01cb,2024-11-16 13:47:28,How did you get in the running was it just a random pull?
bluejackets,lxgar3w,2024-11-16 11:32:36,Thank you!
bluejackets,lxgi1m6,2024-11-16 12:12:01,For me they said they don't need an email. They just wanted my phone number. I assume they will call or text me then.
bluejackets,lxh3bzd,2024-11-16 14:05:04,Yeah it is randomly selected. Was selected when I sat down at my seat for the first time about 15-20 minutes after the doors opened.
bluejackets,lxh34se,2024-11-16 14:04:00,Labanc is really quietly putting some pretty good numbers together. 9 points in 12 games +5. He’s not a world beater but for a last minute emergency add he’s actually been pretty good.
bluejackets,lxiycas,2024-11-16 20:32:16,That was fuckin awesome! I think Olivier got him.
bluejackets,lxfuwbb,2024-11-16 10:03:01,We want 6.  Let’s do it.
bluejackets,lxhbjcb,2024-11-16 14:49:02,KJ on the trip that’s a good sign
bluejackets,lxiyd3n,2024-11-16 20:32:24,DAMN Olivier get in there hell yeah
bluejackets,lxitrdo,2024-11-16 20:03:19,Werenski’s fiancee is posting pictures of Noa Gaudreau at her house right now with Meredith and Meredith has posted multiple photos from CBJ games this season. I am so glad that our city has made her feel so at home that she has decided to stay.
bluejackets,lxj7w2y,2024-11-16 21:34:03,I feel like I'm watching a Pascal Vincent game. Everyone just making head down passes to nobody. What happened to that awesome passing from the beginning of the year?!
bluejackets,lxiyc4c,2024-11-16 20:32:14,That was a fuckin SCRAP damn
bluejackets,lxiy59c,2024-11-16 20:31:02,Better fight than Tyson and Paul
bluejackets,lxi9a8p,2024-11-16 17:56:23,fantilli will score tonight mark my words
bluejackets,lxillg8,2024-11-16 19:12:55,Jrircek is gone
bluejackets,lxixx9b,2024-11-16 20:29:41,Officially welcome to Columbus Fabbro
bluejackets,lxiy4jz,2024-11-16 20:30:55,That was better than Tyson v Paul
bluejackets,lxiy7oy,2024-11-16 20:31:27,That's a fight of the season candidate
bluejackets,lxiybkh,2024-11-16 20:32:08,Just watched and fight and didn’t see any ass cheeks #robbed
bluejackets,lxj78kt,2024-11-16 21:29:47,Severson fucking sucks and I hate Jarmo for everything he left us
bluejackets,lxixvpz,2024-11-16 20:29:25,Gets drilled in the back and then we score lol. Jackets hockey
bluejackets,lxiyfjw,2024-11-16 20:32:50,Those were two guys being dudes right there. Fucking studs
bluejackets,lxh6x00,2024-11-16 14:24:13,They're going to kidnap Fantilli and force Josh Anderson onto our plane
bluejackets,lxioieh,2024-11-16 19:30:50,They’ve called three slashing calls 5 minutes in and they were all barely slashes
bluejackets,lxissol,2024-11-16 19:57:15,Can we please not lose to the habs.
bluejackets,lxixv2i,2024-11-16 20:29:18,Welcome to the team Fabby! Lebanc is a demon.
bluejackets,lxiyeq2,2024-11-16 20:32:41,Olivier by unanimous decision
bluejackets,lxgx4r7,2024-11-16 13:32:08,Question from last night why was bunting so pressed after Sillinger's goal
bluejackets,lxind3v,2024-11-16 19:23:50,"[Waddell on Jiricek: ""The games he's played to be fair maybe he hasn't had a great opportunity. ... But in those games we haven't seen enough to keep him in there on a regular basis.

bluejackets,lxir0et,2024-11-16 19:46:14,Lmao Monny you can’t do that but it was funny!
bluejackets,lxiya35,2024-11-16 20:31:52,Atta boy Olivier
bluejackets,lxizjr5,2024-11-16 20:39:49,Incredible stat courtesy of Portzline:With Labanc’s 10th point tonight he’s passed his point total from last season (9)
bluejackets,lxj781j,2024-11-16 21:29:42,Severson is fucking hot garbage
bluejackets,lxj787e,2024-11-16 21:29:43,Lazy lazy lazy. Severson and Provorov bring out the worst in each other for whatever reason.
bluejackets,lxj7ec4,2024-11-16 21:30:50,Hard to win hockey games when you give odd man rush turnovers in your own zone
bluejackets,lxfwldt,2024-11-16 10:13:10,Go Jackets!
bluejackets,lxfyuzl,2024-11-16 10:26:31,Let's go Jackets!
bluejackets,lxipa8s,2024-11-16 19:35:38,The pace of this game is crazy
bluejackets,lxir2yb,2024-11-16 19:46:40,Hey guys they’re 9th on the power play. I know you’re tired but stop taking penalties
bluejackets,lxj26bf,2024-11-16 20:56:28,The Habs subreddit has hatched a theory that Jiricek is using the “I don’t want to go to the AHL” as a way to force himself out of Columbus and it wouldn’t be an issue otherwise. Yeah you guys should trade for him and send him to Laval. Im sure he would love to play for that guy.
bluejackets,lxj7v4y,2024-11-16 21:33:53,Still have to think keeping McCarthy on as a defense teams coach was a bad move.Dude sucks under three different coaches now.
bluejackets,lxj8rtz,2024-11-16 21:39:58,Welp that sure was a fun way to end the night.
bluejackets,lxj9has,2024-11-16 21:44:39,There are some habits that won’t die until a good percentage of these players are on different teams I’m afraid. Some games they look great and others they look like they’ve never played a game before
bluejackets,lxiojjr,2024-11-16 19:31:02,That non-existent Sevo slash was bs
bluejackets,lxiqxff,2024-11-16 19:45:44,This is... certainly one of the games of all time.
bluejackets,lxiybih,2024-11-16 20:32:07,Matty had the code to the wifi
bluejackets,lxizayk,2024-11-16 20:38:19,Hockey's nuts I love how the announcers go from being hockey commentators to announcing a fight and doing a perfect play by play of the hits
bluejackets,lxj5w6n,2024-11-16 21:20:49,Fantilli...shoot the f'ing puck!!
bluejackets,lxj7qv7,2024-11-16 21:33:07,I really did not miss this team just rolling over and dying at any adversity
bluejackets,lxj88dr,2024-11-16 21:36:20,This is probably the worst period of the season to me. It’s really *not* but it feels like last year when the going got tough the wheels came off.
bluejackets,lximw48,2024-11-16 19:20:55,I don’t think they’re necessarily trading Dave but I am pretty sure he’s headed to Cleveland.  He’s just gonna have to deal with it.
bluejackets,lxixuaj,2024-11-16 20:29:10,Good shot Fabs. Good set up Z
bluejackets,lxixxvv,2024-11-16 20:29:47,Finally
bluejackets,lxj0kx9,2024-11-16 20:46:18,Damn neither goalie can just be a consistent NHL player.
bluejackets,lxj74pe,2024-11-16 21:29:06,Horrendous
bluejackets,lxj77k8,2024-11-16 21:29:36,Defense doing Tarry no favors. Yikes.
bluejackets,lxj77kt,2024-11-16 21:29:36,Have Severson and Provorov ever had a good game when paired together
bluejackets,lxj78y0,2024-11-16 21:29:51,What does the buy out for Severson look like again
bluejackets,lxj7uh7,2024-11-16 21:33:46,Every goal has pretty much been because of a complete lack of structure tonight. I don't even know how we go from demolishing Pittsburgh to forgetting the systems a day later. Trade deadline please come soon.
bluejackets,lxj8nzl,2024-11-16 21:39:15,Wow. Firmly grasp it
bluejackets,lxiqwlc,2024-11-16 19:45:35,Stop taking penalties
bluejackets,lxix9ad,2024-11-16 20:25:32,We have over passed so many times.Just. Shoot.
bluejackets,lxj8qx3,2024-11-16 21:39:48,"""Fantilli just lifts the stick"" Yeah Jody that's a little more than a lift there"
bluejackets,lxjah24,2024-11-16 21:51:16,I blame 80% of this on jarmo
bluejackets,lxj95hv,2024-11-16 21:42:28,This is embarrassingly bad. Horrible passing and making Montreal look like Jets.
bluejackets,lxio9ke,2024-11-16 19:29:20,Fuck
bluejackets,lxiw130,2024-11-16 20:17:43,Voronkov makes some really great one touch passes
bluejackets,lxixrpo,2024-11-16 20:28:43,Yessss!
bluejackets,lxixsk9,2024-11-16 20:28:52,Nice!!
bluejackets,lxj74na,2024-11-16 21:29:05,We look SLOW tonight (and we can’t connect passes without giving up momentum)
bluejackets,lxj7twh,2024-11-16 21:33:39,Welp. There go the wheels.
bluejackets,lxj83c6,2024-11-16 21:35:23,I hate back2backs. I don't think I've ever seen a team not play slow and sloppy on the back-end game.
bluejackets,lxj8q74,2024-11-16 21:39:39,I mean it doesn't really matter but since when was that a penalty? 
bluejackets,lxiz6dx,2024-11-16 20:37:30,Oli looks like a big guy on the ice... Met him on opening night when he walked the blue carpet and he's not what I expected. He's skinnier than I pictured.
bluejackets,lxj0f54,2024-11-16 20:45:17,Man Tarry has made some nice saves this game but wtf was that
bluejackets,lxj7mze,2024-11-16 21:32:25,Welp you guys have a good night.  I’m out.
bluejackets,lxij3hs,2024-11-16 18:57:38,Go!Fight!Win!
bluejackets,lxix6xv,2024-11-16 20:25:07,Just gotta get one
bluejackets,lxiy0qv,2024-11-16 20:30:16,The waiver line (+ Kuraly) looking good!
bluejackets,lxiyqhl,2024-11-16 20:34:44,Much better energy...
bluejackets,lxj3qgi,2024-11-16 21:06:36,2 points out of this is very much needed.
bluejackets,lxj5vl6,2024-11-16 21:20:43,SHOOT
bluejackets,lxiyw3v,2024-11-16 20:35:43,Wonder how long until I don’t think “wow Peeke doing something good for once” when it’s Christiansen.
bluejackets,lxj7h00,2024-11-16 21:31:19,Not saying I relate to Dean right now but I completely get what he's thinking right here
bluejackets,lxj7p7n,2024-11-16 21:32:49,Christiansen stinks too
bluejackets,lxixp6h,2024-11-16 20:28:18,Welcome to the family son.

bluejackets,lxiog2x,2024-11-16 19:30:27,Jesus fucking christ.
bluejackets,lxiqzir,2024-11-16 19:46:05,Hmm seems like the wrong guy got the penalty there
bluejackets,lxix3ro,2024-11-16 20:24:33,They look like shit
bluejackets,lxj0c3i,2024-11-16 20:44:45,... Jesus christ lol
bluejackets,lxj3c2m,2024-11-16 21:04:01,Anybody else notice Mearsy and Jody doing the intermission report instead of Brian and Jean-Luc like normal? Wonder what’s up with that

bluejackets,lxj9dzx,2024-11-16 21:44:03,I mean I guess if you can't beat them then just beat on em ....
bluejackets,lxil4yv,2024-11-16 19:10:08,Is Waddell drunk for this interview?
bluejackets,lximec2,2024-11-16 19:17:51,[deleted]
bluejackets,lxioc2o,2024-11-16 19:29:46,Damn
bluejackets,lxioc5l,2024-11-16 19:29:47,welp
bluejackets,lxioiah,2024-11-16 19:30:49,I see we have our heads in our asses to start the night
bluejackets,lxir0cy,2024-11-16 19:46:14,Why
bluejackets,lxiutw1,2024-11-16 20:10:05,Why can't we get a call? Are we dirty?
bluejackets,lxnk6f2,2024-11-17 16:24:29,Waddell is watching the Monsters game in Providence right now. Lol imagine “yeah Jiricek just take the bus home with these guys”
bluejackets,lxizukn,2024-11-16 20:41:41,How well has Harris been playing this season?
bluejackets,lxj0bgo,2024-11-16 20:44:39,Tarry…
bluejackets,lxj0gim,2024-11-16 20:45:31,wtf tarry
bluejackets,lxj1ona,2024-11-16 20:53:22,Ugh. Prove me wrong again please.
bluejackets,lxj93va,2024-11-16 21:42:10,Bag skate them.Embarrassing effort.
bluejackets,lxj7ahk,2024-11-16 21:30:08,I can not wait until we trade that homophobic turnover machine Provorov
bluejackets,lxj0ev5,2024-11-16 20:45:14,Tarry should’ve had that
bluejackets,lxj75bx,2024-11-16 21:29:12,Christ
bluejackets,lxip6s5,2024-11-16 19:35:02,Wow. We look *bad*
bluejackets,lxioik6,2024-11-16 19:30:52,Christiansen is booty cheeks.
bluejackets,lxiohhm,2024-11-16 19:30:41,Team is asleep going to be a long night
bluejackets,lxi6zga,2024-11-16 17:42:46,Yeah when I saw 8 assists on the season for him last night I was surprised.  He's quietly having a productive season
bluejackets,lxiaujn,2024-11-16 18:06:08,In hockey or in the bedroom?
bluejackets,lxilsvj,2024-11-16 19:14:10,That was my thought hearing that too.
bluejackets,lxhfrei,2024-11-16 15:12:08,They’ve moved off Anderson for a bit the new one for this week is “Calgary’s first for Jiricek”
bluejackets,lxhan78,2024-11-16 14:44:09,Some players take shots like that on an open goal with great offense. Basically some take that as rubbing salt in the wound.
bluejackets,lxio3n4,2024-11-16 19:28:20,My lip reading suggests he said go back to own xxxx bench.   Maybe he thought Cole was lingering a little too long in front of their bench to taunt them.  (He wasnt).    Also: i cant lip read.
bluejackets,lxio294,2024-11-16 19:28:05,Look I understand there’s a feeling of “we have come to a crossroads” but Jiricek is still 20 years old and has played 52 career NHL games. That’s early to move on from him.
bluejackets,lxipg16,2024-11-16 19:36:37,What's happening in a week? Not like anybody's coming back from injury or anything. Still have 8 D like they started the year with.
bluejackets,lxiu698,2024-11-16 20:05:56,to be faiiiuuuh
bluejackets,lxinoqe,2024-11-16 19:25:48,Sounds like a trade
bluejackets,lxis23l,2024-11-16 19:52:41,My buddy is watching from his place and called me just to laugh about it lol
bluejackets,lxjudvw,2024-11-17 00:15:10,Good for him! Let's unlock him some more
bluejackets,lxj8xno,2024-11-16 21:41:01,No this is unironically the worst period we've had. This team has no structure to it at all right now and the fact Montreal of all teams is torching us should say everything.
bluejackets,lxj9k8c,2024-11-16 21:45:12,I think the wheels blew off. 
bluejackets,lxj7c0l,2024-11-16 21:30:25,I brought that up to Svaboda. He said they had good analytics. I don't recall 
bluejackets,lxj047j,2024-11-16 20:43:23,They all are.  Hockey is at heart an endurance sport so you don't get a lot of bodybuilder looking dudes playing.
bluejackets,lxj45qv,2024-11-16 21:09:25,Yeah hopefully we will have a third period push like last night
bluejackets,lxjko2f,2024-11-16 23:00:22,"""Why is Scott Harrington at center"""
bluejackets,lxj5ua6,2024-11-16 21:20:29,Ignore him.  He’s a troll looking for attention.
bluejackets,lxj5wbh,2024-11-16 21:20:50,Wow
bluejackets,lxj5xub,2024-11-16 21:21:08,Don’t give this guy attention. He’s not worth it.In fact don’t even click that link if you haven’t already.
bluejackets,lxj9msj,2024-11-16 21:45:40,Would be nice if they showed that emotion after one of those goals and put it into getting back on track and onto the scoresheet
bluejackets,lxilo8c,2024-11-16 19:13:23,As the head of the Blue Jackets organization how could you not be? /s
bluejackets,lximofn,2024-11-16 19:19:35,Ceremony for Webers introduction into HHOF.
bluejackets,lxj0jgf,2024-11-16 20:46:02,Pretty meh. Not horrible but nothing special. Basically as advertised.
bluejackets,lxj9q1e,2024-11-16 21:46:15,what do you want this team to do its undermanned under powered and one of the youngest inexperienced team that came into the season after losing their star player and probably the glue that kept them togethernot to mention on the back end of a B2Bget the fuck out of here with bag skate
bluejackets,lxj7p40,2024-11-16 21:32:48,We're really still doing this
bluejackets,lxi8n53,2024-11-16 17:52:30,Playing mostly on the fourth line and pretty low minutes too.
bluejackets,lxiawag,2024-11-16 18:06:26,senses say both
bluejackets,lxivt70,2024-11-16 20:16:20,Hearing what?
bluejackets,lxhnnvj,2024-11-16 15:55:19,I read in The Athletic that Pittsburgh took exception to Silly taking a relatively late poke at Jarry after he made a save. This was likely a continuation/escalation of that.
bluejackets,lxir5w8,2024-11-16 19:47:09,Remember when people were flipping on Sillinger a couple of years ago? These guys aren't even old enough to drink...
bluejackets,lxipxk0,2024-11-16 19:39:38,KJ would have to be activated off IR in order to play. He’s on the trip with the team so he’s obviously very close to a return.
bluejackets,lxj2xdz,2024-11-16 21:01:22,I do have to agree with that. They all were slimmer than expected I don't know why I just pictured Ollie as like a Popeye after he had spinach kind of look... But seeing him in person I think Danforth is actually bigger
bluejackets,lxj84v3,2024-11-16 21:35:41,Some of em are.  They don’t care that he’s one of the best defenseman we have.   It always goes back to that one time he didn’t wear a pride jersey.   It doesn’t matter that he has family in Russia and that such a thing could affect them directly because they don’t look at this type of stuff the same way it is in the states.    They don’t care.
bluejackets,lxiay6m,2024-11-16 18:06:45,hell yeah
bluejackets,lxixa97,2024-11-16 20:25:42,It'd be a major blow to my confidence in the management if they did that so quickly. I already don't like some of their decisions but that'd be the worst one imo.
bluejackets,lxj3aaz,2024-11-16 21:03:41,I remember when I met Bob back in 2014 or 15 I was super surprised with how skinny he was. I thought he looked weird lol  ....then I grew up to look the same which is funny.
bluejackets,lxj8icn,2024-11-16 21:38:12,It doesn’t seem to matter either that he had a 13 year old brother playing hockey in Moscow actively trying to come over to the US at that time either. Or that he didn’t actually say anything about it until a reporter crammed a microphone into his face and he kept trying to change the subject.
bluejackets,lxj89lf,2024-11-16 21:36:34,Oh I'm well aware. I'm just sick of hearing about it. He's Russian Orthodox. Plenty of Russians in the NHL hate to tell ya.
bluejackets,lxjn7tp,2024-11-16 23:19:08,Exactly.  I don’t recall him ever saying anything hateful and if he actually had I’d like to see a link.  I’m fairly certain he was just being cautious because like you said he has a brother playing in Moscow.   As I’m sure you know in Russia they don’t play around with this type of stuff.  The government will actively ruin families over having a pro opinion when it comes to LGBTQ stuff.  I would hope anybody in Provorov’s shoes would’ve done the same thing.   I don’t think people realize how dangerous it is to go against the Russian government.
bluejackets,lxj8j81,2024-11-16 21:38:22,The bitching about him always comes off as so performative too I just can't take anyone who does it seriously.
bluejackets,lxe1xug,2024-11-16 00:22:48,Greatly appreciate these recaps
bluejackets,lxdt159,2024-11-15 23:13:15,What a great game to be at. I got to hear a 10 year old kid giving shitsburgh the business the entire game. It was hilarious.
bluejackets,lxdhmht,2024-11-15 21:56:13,Shittsburg fans had a long 20 minute ride home to Powell after tonight
bluejackets,lxg9anl,2024-11-16 11:24:38,This is great. Would love to see more of this format
bluejackets,lxh7yhu,2024-11-16 14:29:46,That picture is mint! 
bluejackets,lxgg0qa,2024-11-16 12:01:04,This format is brilliant. Keep it coming
bluejackets,lxh92au,2024-11-16 14:35:41,Just want to understand whats happening here that penguin is getting shot in the face by a cannon?
bluejackets,lxfjkue,2024-11-16 08:49:28,Lowkey made a joke to two pens fans leaving with like 8 left in the third and said “you guys heading out early for the long drive back to upper Arlington?” And they paused really confused and said “sorry got a little shocked because we actually do live in upper Arlington”
bluejackets,lxdr3cc,2024-11-15 22:59:02,Lucky bastards I live in Kentucky. Can we trade?? Lol
bluejackets,lxigcbe,2024-11-16 18:40:33,It AI Pittsburgh were the only penguins harmed in the creation of that image
bluejackets,lxgit5w,2024-11-16 12:16:06,Lmaooooooo that's so good
bluejackets,lxii28r,2024-11-16 18:51:15,Uh... Ya. It's just weird. Like that's a depiction of an animal.
bluejackets,lxdep4k,2024-11-15 21:36:23,always feels good beating the penguinsbut especially at home in regulation for the first time since 2019
bluejackets,lxdf05o,2024-11-15 21:38:27,Build the statue Evason beat the pens first try
bluejackets,lxdf6wp,2024-11-15 21:39:44,After so many years of them flooding our barn that “CBJ!” chant at the end sounded so good
bluejackets,lxdeqnw,2024-11-15 21:36:41,Ahhhh the Jackets beating the Penguins is so satisfying
bluejackets,lxdeuf1,2024-11-15 21:37:22,I hope these Pittsburg fans get stuck in traffic on their drives home to the Columbus suburbs
bluejackets,lxdeu58,2024-11-15 21:37:19,After that difficult western road trip it’s good we could come home and beat up on a shitty opponent to get the vibes back.
bluejackets,lxdiw8i,2024-11-15 22:04:39,My kink is witnessing Ohio based Pittsburgh fans leave a stadium sad. 
bluejackets,lxdew55,2024-11-15 21:37:42,6 on the pen wings feels good.
bluejackets,lxdewrd,2024-11-15 21:37:49,Ending a long losing streak is good for the heart and a big win against the Penguins on home ice is good for the soul. Not a flawless game but we played well and played a full sixty minutes. Can't complain too much.
bluejackets,lxdfx4x,2024-11-15 21:44:41,Also anyone else see the post on the Pens sub bragging about taking over our arena? Painfully awkward car ride home.
bluejackets,lxdezua,2024-11-15 21:38:24,Bye bye Shittsburgh! 
bluejackets,lxdfstq,2024-11-15 21:43:53,I cannot even begin to describe how good it feels to beat the pens. I had a bunch of annoying fucking pens fans around me and nothing tasted sweeter than to hear them shut the fuck up as they started losing
bluejackets,lxdg7yd,2024-11-15 21:46:45,Matyechuk ended the game against Providence in overtime with his second goal of the night.   SUFFAH PENGUINS.   SUFFAH PROVIDENCE.
bluejackets,lxdh21k,2024-11-15 21:52:22,Sure they have generational talent and Stanley cups but we won 6-2.  Suck it
bluejackets,lxdpz0s,2024-11-15 22:51:17,From Scheig > Voronkov was a menace tonight. #CBJ  out-attempted the Penguins 22-5 when he was on the ice at 5v5 per NatStatTrick.Jesus maybe the top line is a good place for him for awhile
bluejackets,lxdepkh,2024-11-15 21:36:28,I dig it.
bluejackets,lxdfcyi,2024-11-15 21:40:54,Was it perfect? Nope. Did we persevere through it all? Oh hell yeah.  Did it feel good to watch the Penguins fans who were gearing up to be garbage people deflate like balloons? You bet your ass it did.Also congrats to Elvis on 200 games and that incredibly sick glove save!
bluejackets,lxdes7x,2024-11-15 21:36:58,It is very nice to be proven wrong. Let's get a 2nd!
bluejackets,lxdf2iv,2024-11-15 21:38:54,Always nice to come back from a bad road trip and absolutely shit on the worst team in the league. Love beating up on those lil’ kids!
bluejackets,lxdtzim,2024-11-15 23:19:57,The Pittsburg sucks chant was too brief but quite satisfying!
bluejackets,lxdfbew,2024-11-15 21:40:36,BOYS ONE MINUTE REMAINING IN THE THIRD PERIOD AND…
bluejackets,lxdkwl8,2024-11-15 22:17:48,I really feel like we as a fan base needed this one.
bluejackets,lxdf025,2024-11-15 21:38:26,Moved to Western PA for grad school back in August. I'm wearing my CBJ hat and shirt on campus tomorrow!!! LET'S GO JACKETS!!!
bluejackets,lxdk24z,2024-11-15 22:12:17,Apart from the absolute joy it was to witness that in person… I’m most happy we had a decent third period. Haven’t seen one in a while.
bluejackets,lxdewnk,2024-11-15 21:37:48,Penguins dynasty is officially over
bluejackets,lxdhpru,2024-11-15 21:56:49,that was cathartic
bluejackets,lxdjg2d,2024-11-15 22:08:17,I will never be upset about beating Shitsburgh
bluejackets,lxdeuab,2024-11-15 21:37:21,Hell yeah 6 goals against one of the worst defensive teams this season we are so back start our cup parade up again
bluejackets,lxdfok1,2024-11-15 21:43:04,My god yes I came.
bluejackets,lxdg36g,2024-11-15 21:45:51,I just spoiled the game looking at Reddit for me…still love seeing the flightless birds experiencing the beginning of their long winter rebuild
bluejackets,lxdmbfc,2024-11-15 22:26:59,Huge boost for the locker room after a rough road trip. A huge boost to beat a Pens team that brings a lot of white yellow and black jerseys into our stadium. I couldn’t be happier to see the scoring spread around good goaltending in the third and some good late discipline not to take dumb penalties after going up two.
bluejackets,lxdi3g9,2024-11-15 21:59:20,Hockey is fun again!
bluejackets,lxfive6,2024-11-16 08:44:35,I feel like the Jackets good luck charm. I just started following them this season but so far I’ve seen them play Toronto Pittsburgh and Edmonton and it was belt to ass in all 3 games.
bluejackets,lxdgwx2,2024-11-15 21:51:24,I dunno this feels like a bit of a changing of the guard. Since when are we kicking the Pens ass? Last year I remember hanging my head as Sid scored a hatty on us.
bluejackets,lxdycdf,2024-11-15 23:51:46,how did fabbro look? I didn’t get to watch the game
bluejackets,lxfh6d2,2024-11-16 08:32:49,I was there last night and of course watching them kick Pittsburgh’s ass was awesome but the fan experience watching the pregame player introductions/countdown to puck drop was insanely cool. Coming down the big fan walkway with Elvis holding eye contact with the camera while leading the team was so badass. I’m not a big Elvis fan but man does he know how to lock in and give off poise and authority when he’s feeling himself. The way the camera guy was on skates recording each player giving it an authentic kind of “on-ice” feeling rather than a stationary camera guy in their face. And then as *Wow* by Tiesto’s beat dropped the soft red and blue lights with the fog the camera slowly skating toward Elvis. Man that was insanely cool. It felt so immersive and I don’t remember ever caring about that pregame hype video/intro ever before.
bluejackets,lxe0nbt,2024-11-16 00:10:49,Nice to win one after that road trip
bluejackets,lxhdae4,2024-11-16 14:58:32,NOT DEAD YET
bluejackets,lxdnxic,2024-11-15 22:37:33,Wait is that true???
bluejackets,lxfjbha,2024-11-16 08:47:40,Hopefully there's like 30 more of those behind it.  I highly enjoy watching the downfall of this Pens team in real time
bluejackets,lxdgxnn,2024-11-15 21:51:33,I could see their fans sneaking into the bathroom to trash their Pens jerseys with a CBJ hoodie underneath to join the chanting
bluejackets,lxe2wg4,2024-11-16 00:31:51,"I've read some things online about the fans chanting CBJ ""plus something else"". Apparently even Evason said something about it. Couldn't hear it on the  TV broadcast -- can anyone else enlighten me what exactly the chant was."
bluejackets,lxdfpju,2024-11-15 21:43:15,Long drive back to Powell
bluejackets,lxdg5om,2024-11-15 21:46:19,You mean back to the trailer parks
bluejackets,lxektin,2024-11-16 03:21:08,dont worry they aint driving far
bluejackets,lxds8rx,2024-11-15 23:07:23,What a day to be alive!
bluejackets,lxfjuq5,2024-11-16 08:51:24,I take solace that it'll be a generation before they come close to winning another one
bluejackets,lxfmkod,2024-11-16 09:09:49,We need a version of Cleveland Rocks to play after a win like this but with the crowd screaming Pittsburgh Sucks.
bluejackets,lxeb75x,2024-11-16 01:41:28,The pens genuinely are very bad. It's crazy because many guys are still playing great. Their defense is old and hot ass and the goaltending is laughable. You better believe we're coming for that 7th in the metro spot you mother fuckers. Seems about time for the NHL to have them win the lottery.
bluejackets,lxdncdk,2024-11-15 22:33:39,Get the boom-boni ready!
bluejackets,lxebj88,2024-11-16 01:44:35,We played them well all last year just blew every tie game when it mattered. As was Vincent's greatest strength and generally a CBJ tradition.
bluejackets,lxf9rjn,2024-11-16 07:36:22,I think he’ll be a decent partner for Z. Fabbro had decent mobility. He just looked solid. Makes little plays knows to get the puck to Z and cover him.If he can cover Z and let him roam the offensive zone like he did when he played with Josi in Nashville it should be a decent fit for this season.
bluejackets,lxeolii,2024-11-16 04:03:55,Columbus at home against Pittsburgh since 2019-20 (regular season)November 29 2019: Columbus won 5-2March 12 2020: canceled due to pandemic2020-21 season: no games due to pandemic and temporary realignmentJanuary 21 2022: Pittsburgh won 5-2February 27 2022: Pittsburgh won 3-2October 22 2022: Pittsburgh won 6-3April 13 2023: Columbus won 3-2 (OT)November 14 2023: Pittsburgh won 5-3March 30 2024: Columbus won 4-3 (SO)November 15 2024: Columbus won 6-2
bluejackets,lxdo8rn,2024-11-15 22:39:37,It sure feels like it
bluejackets,lxdjpob,2024-11-15 22:10:02,The number sticking around for the 3 stars said it all 
bluejackets,lxea7jp,2024-11-16 01:32:11,It was “Pittsburgh sucks” lol
bluejackets,lxdgfxg,2024-11-15 21:48:15,Grovetucky
bluejackets,lxg5844,2024-11-16 11:02:18,I was reading that Z trained a lot this summer with Josi. Nice little coincidence here. It seems Fabbro has slid right into our defensive systems quite easily too.
bluejackets,lxfil7t,2024-11-16 08:42:39,Figured. Thanks.
bluejackets,lxdifdg,2024-11-15 22:01:31,So many yinzers in GrovetuckySource: Grew up in Grovetucky
bluejackets,lxg5gdy,2024-11-16 11:03:32,Z and Josi are similar players so Fabrro should fit in quickly.
bluejackets,lxb0o9h,2024-11-15 13:33:24,I never viewed him as an egotistical player but some cracks are starting to show that he might be.Kid needs at least another year in the AHL. He did well his first stint there then followed it up with a similarly good performance especially in the playoffs.His skating is still atrocious and he still makes some questionable decisions in regards to his hockey IQ. Another year to cook down there should really help him.Plenty of high end defensemen marinate in the minors before coming up to make big impacts with their major club.
bluejackets,lxbrh3b,2024-11-15 15:49:05,I don't know what his agent is telling him but I hope they are looking at the big picture and giving him good advice.  He is going to have a much better and longer career if he develops properly.  If playing in the AHL is going to help facilitate that then the agent should be in his ear telling him that.  There are hundreds of examples of players who failed to develop after being rushed.  I can't think of many that that were hurt by spending additional time in the AHL.
bluejackets,lxb9tlu,2024-11-15 14:18:47,I don't think where he is matters as much as what he's working on while there.  Regardless of if he is in the NHL or AHL he needs to be working on strength and skating daily - and even playing in games should take a backseat to his workouts. If he's willing to do that so long as he's collecting an NHL paycheck then fine.
bluejackets,lxbw1un,2024-11-15 16:12:17,We spent a 6th overall pick on him I hope we keep trying to make it work.
bluejackets,lxb29um,2024-11-15 13:41:20,If he actually refuses to go to the AHL where he needs to be to develop properly then id trade him before the rest of the league figures it out and his value tanks.
bluejackets,lxbaayr,2024-11-15 14:21:12,They talked about him on 32 Thoughts today and they are being very careful with their words but they seem to side with Columbus on this one. It’s long but here’s some quotes if anyone is interested. My interpretation is “Columbus is trying to do things differently. Their coach has the right to do that. I am seeing positive results - Evason is on the right track here - I have no issue with what he’s doing - That doesn’t change the fact that he wants to play - they’ve come to an impasse here” > “one of the things that I do believe about the Blue Jackets and I believe some of the veterans have asked about it there too is they want to tougher and a higher standard right? And you know young kids want to play. They you know like you said he’s 21 years old.> You don’t want to lose him. And you forget that he got hurt the year of his draft and he probably would have gone even higher. That’s right.> If he hadn’t. So you’ve got a bunch of veterans there asking for a tougher standard. You got Evason who’s a demanding coach and you’ve got a kid who wants to play and kids represented by Alan Walsh who’s no shrinking violet either.”> “And I’ll say like I mean as much as and everything that Columbus has dealt with over the last few months Elliotte and though it was a tough trip out west for them over the last little while here when I was down there for the home opener like you got a sense that there was like there is a certain effort and how they go about things you know despite results haven’t been where they would want it to be the last few years that I thought was impressive in how they’re going about approaching things. So when you mention about the veterans kind of having a standard of what they want to see and the coaching staff too that doesn’t surprise me in the least bit.> I don’t have a problem at all with a coach saying like these are my 18 best players or these are my 18 most deserving players and they deserve to be in the lineup. I have no issue with that. I have no problem with Dean Evason trying to set a standard for the way the Columbus Blue Jackets should prepare and play.”> “I have no issue with that. This is simply just a realization that you come to a fork in the road sometimes with a player and how is it going to go? And that’s you know ultimately the player is going to want to play.”
bluejackets,lxfbyus,2024-11-16 07:54:21,People really need to stop saying Jiricek is refusing to go down or has threatened to refuse to go. There is no reporting about that.And Walsh doesn’t just start shit by himself he works for the player not the other way around.
bluejackets,lxgd2f3,2024-11-16 11:45:05,I already commented on this in an earlier discussion about Jiricek. It’s worth going back and watching the televised training camp scrimmage. There’s a lot of discussion about Jiricek between Jody Mearsy Nash and Vogelhuber. Vogelhuber’s comments were really interesting. He talked about working with Jiricek last season on his attitude after being sent down and that he still needs a lot of development with his skating and hockey IQ.  A lot of discussion on developing a D player and how it’s different than a forward. Few D men can step into the NHL and be successful regardless of size. Most D men need 200 games before they reach their potential and many spend substantial development time in the AHL. The consensus was he should spend this year in the AHL. When KJ comes back Jiricek should be sent down for him to continue to develop his skills and get minutes played.
bluejackets,lxbyp5b,2024-11-15 16:25:43,This is a tough one. Because basically everything that comes from him is either from unreliable source or just quessing things. If there are problems then sure but if not then absolutely not
bluejackets,lxbdbpe,2024-11-15 14:36:31,No denying he needs more time in Cleveland. I don’t think he wants to be there. All the stuff last year with his agent it’s not that surprising he hasn’t been sent down. I think coaching staff is trying to send a message. You’re not good enough to consistently be in the squad every night so you won’t be. Feel free to stick around be apart of the team but you won’t be playing a lot in the NHL. At this point he’s either content with that or he’s not. I think every coach in the organization wants him to be in Cleveland this year for what that’s worth. But ultimately it’s up to Waddell and I reckon he wants him there too.
bluejackets,lxh4olq,2024-11-16 14:12:16,It boggles my mind that a guy like Fantilli was questioning whether he should have gone to Michigan for another year before coming up that he could see how his develop may benefit from something like that. But then there's a guy like Jiricek who is clearly lost out there at times and doesn't see the benefit of spending some time in the AHL. Even Werenski took some time to cook in Michigan/AHL before coming up and I thought he was a better skater starting out.
bluejackets,lxbduh6,2024-11-15 14:39:16,If he’s fine playing like 20-30 games a season and figure it out in the NHL then yeah that’s fine. Ultimately it’d still be better for him to be in the AHL.
bluejackets,lxbe7qp,2024-11-15 14:41:13,Christiansen and Harris need to clear waivers to be sent down. Jiricek doesn’t. He’s the risk free option. The coaching staff has made it clear he’s not good enough to play most nights in the NHL. At this point he’s either refusing or Waddell doesn’t wanna send him down. And there’s been drama before about him going to the AHL so it leads me to believe he might be refusing.
bluejackets,lxbj48l,2024-11-15 15:06:30,If they do assign him to Cleveland and he refuses to go what's the punishment?  A daily fine for failing to report?
bluejackets,lxdc4uf,2024-11-15 21:19:17,Waddell doesn't seem like the type to let agents get leverage over him and force his hand.
bluejackets,lxbjxdx,2024-11-15 15:10:39,i could be wrong but i think failure to report would be a suspension by the team which probably means not getting paid. I dont think they would let it come to that. If they knew he wouldnt report then they wouldnt assign him to cleveland. Making the issue more public would just hurt his value it would be better to just trade him at that point.
bluejackets,lxbklbx,2024-11-15 15:14:04,I just feel like Jiricek doesn't have any serious cards to play here.  He's signed through 2026 and when that deal is over he's an RFA.  I can understand last year soured him but he has basically a new organization in front of him this year. It has to be obvious to him that being an 8th defenseman on the big club isn't helping his development right?
bluejackets,lxbruip,2024-11-15 15:50:58,i think most likely hes just getting really bad advice. He was given every opportunity in camp this year to take over a permanent spot in our lineup. Hell thats what everyone expected him to do and he failed to do that. Hes had multiple NHL coaches and now multiple front offices all basically tell him the same thing. Hes probably very frustrated that his progression hasnt gone as planned but he obviously didnt do the work over the offseason. But yeah his attitude that hes too good for the AHL is only hurting himself.
bluejackets,lxc2pw9,2024-11-15 16:46:16,>But yeah his attitude that hes too good for the AHL is only hurting himself.I still blame Jarmo for that part.  Of course we'll only know what was said publicly but it seems like Jiricek took the GM's statement at the beginning of last season and ran with it.  All that drama is because Jarmo should've kept his mouth shut about a young  tweener defenseman unless they really thought he was fully ready.
bluejackets,lxaj5h5,2024-11-15 12:06:34,Well I just I would love for Prime to do what Apple did with the MLS -- just sell a season pass for the entire league.  Rather than the scattered feel it has now.  I guess I will just keep my FanDuel Sports network sub for now but  I am curious as what happens moving forward as well.
bluejackets,lxairkr,2024-11-15 12:04:38,Please be a reasonable price for the add on.
bluejackets,lxamo5p,2024-11-15 12:24:05,As an Ohioan that loves sports I wish there was a way to just pay a set price and get access to all my local sports for the year. Like If i could pay $400 or something like that and get coverage for every Ohio college and pro game for that set year I'd do it in a heartbeat. Between the Crew being on MLS season pass OSU being on a mix of local tv national tv and BTN and pro teams like the Cavs and Jackets being on stuff like Bally sports I can't afford all of the services. Just give me a single provider
bluejackets,lxb5hc2,2024-11-15 13:57:08,I miss NHL Gamecenter so god damn much.
bluejackets,lxat6vu,2024-11-15 12:56:26,I pretty positive that blue jackets deal with diamond sports ends at the end of the season. I know the Cavs deal ends at the end of the season. Kinda think that rock entertainment sports network will take the Cavs and probably the blue jackets
bluejackets,lxam2rv,2024-11-15 12:21:07,Agree.  A single fee for a Center Ice package that includes all games is the most fan friendly option.  Slicing and dicing things in an attempt to get more revenue for the league ends up shutting out potential viewers.
bluejackets,lxcp6vp,2024-11-15 18:53:59,You mean like cable? I wish man. I think the whole streaming thing is worse
bluejackets,lxrpajd,2024-11-18 10:38:28,lol yeah kinda. But I don't need literally any other channel just sports
bluejackets,lxa9pui,2024-11-15 11:20:11,have been enjoying this!
bluejackets,lxaf1eu,2024-11-15 11:46:26,Thanks for the heads up.  As a non-Columbus resident and returning fan I feel I am back to ground zero with my knowledge base of the roster etc.  So looking forward to listening.
bluejackets,lxedvaj,2024-11-16 02:07:10,Is the name a reference to the only minor league team?
bluejackets,lxgr466,2024-11-16 13:00:09,Tried to listen today and the delay in their audio is like being on a work zoom call.  Talking over each other and then stopping to let the other speak and then silence before it starts all over again.  Not to mention all the audible mouse clicking and typing.

bluejackets,lxhcsao,2024-11-16 14:55:47,yea I can understand that - wanted to get up and running without a deep financial investment since it’s a just for fun fan kind of thing so there’s some limitations in that regardwe appreciate the chance/listen nonetheless!

bluejackets,lxd4rx8,2024-11-15 20:31:43,That’s delay of game what the hell? God I hate Pittsburgh.
bluejackets,lxd7776,2024-11-15 20:47:23,Can we retroactively penalize that scumbag for laying on that puck and trying to run out their penalty kill?\\Absolute fucking scum bags.
bluejackets,lxdcitq,2024-11-15 21:21:50,I am hereby humbly requesting an Adam Fantilli goal. Thank you for your consideration.
bluejackets,lxdd1n5,2024-11-15 21:25:18,It's kind of crazy seeing the demise of the Pens franchise. They're on the cusp of going back to pre-Crosby levels of bad and that's with him still on the roster.
bluejackets,lxddfzz,2024-11-15 21:27:57,lol Bunting's mad the hockey player scored a goal in hockey
bluejackets,lxdds9u,2024-11-15 21:30:12,Oh man the exodus of Pens fans after that empty netter. So delicious!
bluejackets,lxddy1u,2024-11-15 21:31:16,My favorite part of this is watching the Pittsburgh broadcast. Their commentators made a comment early in the game how we haven’t won in 6 games and how we can’t keep scoring 6 goals a game. I’m a sucker for irony
bluejackets,lxde90s,2024-11-15 21:33:20,Hey in case you guys are wondering what kind of fans we’re dealing with on their sub they cannot fathom that they’re losing to us because “We are actively grieving our star player passing away”. Never forget that. Scum of the league
bluejackets,lxcxmgd,2024-11-15 19:46:05,There were three Pittsburgh fans huddled together for a selfie outside of the arena and one of them projectile vomited very theatrically all over the other two. It was fucking hysterical.
bluejackets,lxddvyl,2024-11-15 21:30:52,LOL Cole doesn’t celebrate at all and heads back to the bench Bunting tells him to go back to his own bench.   Learning to cry from Sid I guess.
bluejackets,lxdaomr,2024-11-15 21:09:40,Vronk just bulldozing through three Pens and letting Silly take the puck while they were preoccupied with him was kind of an underrated great use of his size.
bluejackets,lxdbzjj,2024-11-15 21:18:20,Hope all those Pittsburgh fans have a safe drive home all the way back to Westerville.
bluejackets,lxddfc3,2024-11-15 21:27:49,Goal Sillinger

bluejackets,lxddx69,2024-11-15 21:31:06,It brings me great joy to say the Penguins are the worst team in the entire NHL and we are better than them. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
bluejackets,lxa4k16,2024-11-15 10:54:36,First Jackets game since moving back! Super stoked

bluejackets,lxauxhj,2024-11-15 13:05:06,We shouldn’t struggle with this iteration of the Pens but you know we will.
bluejackets,lxd469t,2024-11-15 20:27:50,This Pens lady in front of my row has been dancing nonstop for like five minutes.Congratulations you tied the Columbus Blue Jackets a lottery team that had their star player killed over the summer and is now barely over the cap floor.This is not the accomplishment that you seem to think it is.
bluejackets,lxddkau,2024-11-15 21:28:44,Couldn’t happen to a better franchise.
bluejackets,lxddpog,2024-11-15 21:29:43,What's Bunting being a little bitch about?
bluejackets,lxddq4u,2024-11-15 21:29:48,The pengies are pissed their dirty tricks aren't working and that they're facing consequences. It's actually amazing to see
bluejackets,lxaohne,2024-11-15 12:33:04,This is about as must win as you can get this early in the season
bluejackets,lxcx11m,2024-11-15 19:42:24,Hey guys? I still hate Pittsburgh
bluejackets,lxd5fo0,2024-11-15 20:35:58,Was that O'Connor laying on the puck? That was some bratty 6yo behavior
bluejackets,lxda3rq,2024-11-15 21:05:55,love it when Vronk scores
bluejackets,lxdcjz9,2024-11-15 21:22:02,Please for the love of god let this be the game that gets them out of the skid and gets the offense back on trackEspecially with KJ coming back anytime now 
bluejackets,lxdcphp,2024-11-15 21:23:01,I'm loving that we're dunking on the Pens with Jarry in net. Their goaltending situation is as murky as ours.
bluejackets,lxddmez,2024-11-15 21:29:07,BACK TO SHITTSBURGH LOSERS
bluejackets,lxddpbm,2024-11-15 21:29:39,What a bitch move by bunting there.

bluejackets,lxcs7kc,2024-11-15 19:12:38,ZAR revenge goal
bluejackets,lxcsf9k,2024-11-15 19:13:56,Aston Reese has shocked me quite a bit
bluejackets,lxcslak,2024-11-15 19:15:00,Is there an alternate feed for those of us outside of Ohio? It’s one of those games that isn’t on ESPN+ 
bluejackets,lxcuh5l,2024-11-15 19:26:42,Oh JJ's out of the lineup.Maybe that has to do with this start.
bluejackets,lxcvuhm,2024-11-15 19:35:09,mmm I won't feel any sort of confidence until we are up by 2 lol
bluejackets,lxcxed2,2024-11-15 19:44:41,Not a perfect start but a good enough one. Honestly I just want a win can't care much about how it happens
bluejackets,lxd17r1,2024-11-15 20:08:51,Pittsburgh fills my heart with hate
bluejackets,lxd2bu3,2024-11-15 20:15:55,No way that can count
bluejackets,lxd2fac,2024-11-15 20:16:31,9 shots in 28 minutes isn't going to cut it...
bluejackets,lxagdz7,2024-11-15 11:53:02,keep the pens away from out net and off of the zamboni
bluejackets,lxd6bt4,2024-11-15 20:41:43,Ok Elvis
bluejackets,lxddpq2,2024-11-15 21:29:43,The energy here is great
bluejackets,lxd6808,2024-11-15 20:41:01,Holy shit Elvis!!!
bluejackets,lxcr1ot,2024-11-15 19:05:25,Why is this game not on espn+
bluejackets,lxcrfbs,2024-11-15 19:07:49,Hmm the Penguins lead the league with seven blown losses this season but the Jackets are good at doing that too... Does that make this a suck off or a blowing competition?
bluejackets,lxcscah,2024-11-15 19:13:26,Nice start guys. Let’s keep it going
bluejackets,lxcu2w1,2024-11-15 19:24:13,twas a bomb
bluejackets,lxcu311,2024-11-15 19:24:15,Let's fuckin go y'all
bluejackets,lxcv3z0,2024-11-15 19:30:35,High stick?
bluejackets,lxcv4ct,2024-11-15 19:30:39,Was that not a high stick?
bluejackets,lxcvnse,2024-11-15 19:33:59,That reminded me of the flukey goal that bounced off the glass and right down Steve Mason’s back.
bluejackets,lxd1x1i,2024-11-15 20:13:19,Did the stream start over for anyone else?
bluejackets,lxd2a3e,2024-11-15 20:15:36,Miracles do happen…
bluejackets,lxd3zfr,2024-11-15 20:26:38,Six players on one team out there all playing different games.... Can we start acting like we're on one team again
bluejackets,lxd5ujm,2024-11-15 20:38:35,Gotta get to the 3rd with the lead
bluejackets,lxd9v95,2024-11-15 21:04:23,Who was it that said 4-2...
bluejackets,lxdc3by,2024-11-15 21:19:00,SEVSDude's been having a great game really psyched he got rewarded with a goal!!
bluejackets,lxdbzqn,2024-11-15 21:18:22,Everyone at NWA throw your drinks on the Pittsburgh fans.
bluejackets,lxd3va3,2024-11-15 20:25:52,I want to be proven wrong. But I think we're going to lose.
bluejackets,lxchnap,2024-11-15 18:08:41,4-2 win incoming
bluejackets,lxcpwr1,2024-11-15 18:58:22,Love not having a feed for my favorite teams hockey game. Thanks NHL or Gary or whoever makes it so difficult
bluejackets,lxcqbjm,2024-11-15 19:00:54,Does anyone sail the open seas? I need a link for the game since it’s not on espn+ tonight.
bluejackets,lxcs72l,2024-11-15 19:12:33,JESUS CHRISTIANSEN LETS GOedit: ZAR???
bluejackets,lxctx7g,2024-11-15 19:23:15,Honestly in the past few years I can’t remember a time where we immediately converted on a PP
bluejackets,lxcu3za,2024-11-15 19:24:25,How's Fabbro looked so far with us?
bluejackets,lxcu42u,2024-11-15 19:24:26,"""...as Accari tries to play goaltender but not really."" "
bluejackets,lxcu9zh,2024-11-15 19:25:28,It's Zach all the way down.
bluejackets,lxcvlk8,2024-11-15 19:33:36,Thanku Danny and Marchy holy shit
bluejackets,lxcwhmv,2024-11-15 19:39:06,Provy and Severson doing damn good work there
bluejackets,lxd18jd,2024-11-15 20:08:59,I just have... a bad feeling about this game.
bluejackets,lxd1c80,2024-11-15 20:09:38,Ugh. That delayed penalty play in our end was agonizing to watch.
bluejackets,lxd3hx7,2024-11-15 20:23:23,Lmfao oops Mike Todd just got cut off mid game because play started again
bluejackets,lxd3pb6,2024-11-15 20:24:45,Was that killing in the name of?
bluejackets,lxd5ds2,2024-11-15 20:35:37,How is fabbro looking so far?
bluejackets,lxd617h,2024-11-15 20:39:48,How we lookin'?
bluejackets,lxbmo98,2024-11-15 15:24:38,Mixed feelings of Voronkov on the first line. Hasn’t quite looked like himself this year hopefully this is the kickstart he needs
bluejackets,lxcvkzb,2024-11-15 19:33:30,Good lord Elvis put himself in danger there and somehow still got it
bluejackets,lxdcorg,2024-11-15 21:22:53,bro did Elvis get a piece of thate: oh nvm he didn't it just hit the post
bluejackets,lx9uq1j,2024-11-15 10:04:42,Elvis in the net
bluejackets,lxckeut,2024-11-15 18:25:00,The amount of penguins fans here is absolutely disgusting
bluejackets,lxcoe1h,2024-11-15 18:49:05,So FanDuel on Spectrum took a dump...not good.
bluejackets,lxcp2eb,2024-11-15 18:53:13,Got tickets to see favorite band a good day at work for the first time all week  luck has been on my side today. A Jackets win over Pittsburgh will complete the trifecta
bluejackets,lxcrlsp,2024-11-15 19:08:55,Holy fuck. For those of us with the pleasure to experience that pregame player intro in person. What an experience that was insanely cool
bluejackets,lxcttxh,2024-11-15 19:22:41,YAAAAAAAAAAH!
bluejackets,lxctxgd,2024-11-15 19:23:17,Yessssssss
bluejackets,lxcugss,2024-11-15 19:26:39,I’m trying not to get too excited as I’ve seen this before with Pittsburgh
bluejackets,lxcuqpc,2024-11-15 19:28:20,You know if you told me this time in 2014 that there would be a point where the Pens had Crosby Malkin Letang and *Erik Karlsson* and were sucking just like us I would've thought you were taking a whole lot of controlled substances and washing them down with glue.
bluejackets,lxcuyyo,2024-11-15 19:29:44,shit. let's get a couple more shall we?
bluejackets,lxd1gg0,2024-11-15 20:10:23,Bad
bluejackets,lxd366b,2024-11-15 20:21:17,Lol
bluejackets,lxd41tb,2024-11-15 20:27:02,Welp.  Looks like i’m switching to the Monsters game
bluejackets,lxd4l5o,2024-11-15 20:30:30,SINGLE LADIES I CAN'T HEAR Y'ALL
bluejackets,lxdc3x0,2024-11-15 21:19:07,Man Severson had a wide open net on the right and chooses to go for a tiny opening top left….gotta wonder if he didn’t miss that by three feet on that goal.
bluejackets,lxd2wxj,2024-11-15 20:19:40,Aaand now the Pens guys are calling for more players to run over Elvis
bluejackets,lxcudr1,2024-11-15 19:26:07,Listening to the game and Bob didn't seem too excited about that goal. Not so as he usually is when we score. Especially on a power play. And Especially against pittsburgh.
bluejackets,lxcv8q9,2024-11-15 19:31:25,Harris is fucking ass
bluejackets,lxbfg06,2024-11-15 14:47:44,That third line is scary rough
bluejackets,lxd5dud,2024-11-15 20:35:38,Danforth deciding well if they're not gonna call it dead i can just dig it out made me grin. Atta boy.
bluejackets,lxd7ipd,2024-11-15 20:49:27,Ridiculous. It should’ve been called for delay of game. Like how is that pick still in play??
bluejackets,lxd7byh,2024-11-15 20:48:14,THAT was some happy fuckin horseshit
bluejackets,lxddrni,2024-11-15 21:30:05,I’m here for it. I’ve been so tired of Pittsburgh
bluejackets,lxddx05,2024-11-15 21:31:04,They’re so fucked. I don’t even mean that to be a hater but all the competent people in the organization left they’re stuck with terrible contracts and they have no prospects. Literally years upon years away from the playoffs again.
bluejackets,lxde920,2024-11-15 21:33:20,I'm sure Kansas City will be happy to have them.
bluejackets,lxdduz7,2024-11-15 21:30:42,Hope they have a safe drive back to Grove City
bluejackets,lxdo367,2024-11-15 22:38:36,We *can't* keep scoring 6 a game. And we didn't for a bit. So now we good time to run it up.
bluejackets,lxdejpn,2024-11-15 21:35:22,We're grieving Johnny while simultaneously curbstomping them. Hope that clears things up for them.
bluejackets,lxdeytx,2024-11-15 21:38:12,What the actual fuck?You'd think they'd be a little more fucking understanding after just losing Adam Johnson.
bluejackets,lxdbkj2,2024-11-15 21:15:33,Him on a line with KJ sounds deadly. Vronk bodies half the other team and KJ has all that extra space. Super excited for him to be back
bluejackets,lxdcio0,2024-11-15 21:21:48,Funny enough my boss is there and she's a Pittsburgh fan.. but she's in Bexley 
bluejackets,lxa9ebr,2024-11-15 11:18:35,I miss Boone but I don’t miss 27 minutes a night on the top line Boone.
bluejackets,lxd6iwk,2024-11-15 20:43:00,Start dancing making sure to hum loudly enough to yourself that she can hear.
bluejackets,lxd7qym,2024-11-15 20:50:56,sold my tickets tonight (probably to a Pens fan tbh) just cause last time the Pens played here  I almost got in a tussle with one and I don't  want to lose my tickets :(
bluejackets,lxb6yfg,2024-11-15 14:04:25,I moved back last weekend from Atlanta can’t wait to go to games again!

bluejackets,lxddt8p,2024-11-15 21:30:23,It doesn't help that their defense is God awful in front of him either
bluejackets,lxacbh0,2024-11-15 11:33:03,Excellent opportunity for them to right the ship tonight
bluejackets,lxd2ru3,2024-11-15 20:18:46,average Pittsburgh broadcasterevery time the feed played on TV defaults to the Pens broadcast I die a little inside
bluejackets,lxdds3h,2024-11-15 21:30:10,Oh buddy he had it years before he got to Pittsburgh
bluejackets,lxdc4kp,2024-11-15 21:19:14,Dare I say we want ten?
bluejackets,lxdh8gu,2024-11-15 21:53:34,The “look at the scoreboard” game. Legendary.
bluejackets,lxcu7v6,2024-11-15 19:25:05,what a pass from Yegor
bluejackets,lxcvkmv,2024-11-15 19:33:26,Reminded me of my random teammates on Rocket League.
bluejackets,lxdceee,2024-11-15 21:21:02,That's a deep cut I can get behind.Do it too it Lars
bluejackets,lxcuqy2,2024-11-15 19:28:23,You have my sympathy. I was in the same boat for a lot of years with baseball.
bluejackets,lxcsrao,2024-11-15 19:16:01,Me too. Very much hope we consider having him stick around
bluejackets,lxd325l,2024-11-15 20:20:35,The shots they are taking are so low danger too. No pressure being put on Jarry
bluejackets,lxcr8m7,2024-11-15 19:06:37,It’s being broadcast on NHL Network. Whenever that happens there is no stream on ESPN+
bluejackets,lxcrz2l,2024-11-15 19:11:10,FanDuel is such ass. High seas here I come arrrghh
bluejackets,lxcvy9p,2024-11-15 19:35:47,Noooo not the fucking pants goal!! I managed to block that out till you reminded me lmfao
bluejackets,lxcsa2l,2024-11-15 19:13:03,Sports surge dot net
bluejackets,lxd6axj,2024-11-15 20:41:33,bad but not the worst team playing in this game
bluejackets,lxcm9s8,2024-11-15 18:36:10,I don't know how I feel about that.  I don't know how I would feel if Tarasov was in the net either.  I just don't know how I feel about either of the goalies.  The defense has just been so bad in front of both of them that it's hard to tell if Elvis is doing better or if Tarasov is good.
bluejackets,lxclhoq,2024-11-15 18:31:28,It always is.  Sad thing is quite a few of them are Jacket fans until the Pens come to town.
bluejackets,lxcv2qt,2024-11-15 19:30:23,[deleted]
bluejackets,lxd4ok8,2024-11-15 20:31:07,Yeah Mateychuck scored again might as well have fun looking at the future.
bluejackets,lxd8w0i,2024-11-15 20:58:08,It can't be called if it's another Pens penalty. The NHL loves 'em some Pittsburgh.
bluejackets,lxde1x2,2024-11-15 21:32:00,And they're probably going to wind up firing Sullivan as their best ever coach.
bluejackets,lxdeg9k,2024-11-15 21:34:43,They have a ways to go just to get to the point where they are rebuilding.
bluejackets,lxde94u,2024-11-15 21:33:21,Way too many of them will be wearing their CBJ sweaters next week and scanning their season tickets
bluejackets,lxdflp4,2024-11-15 21:42:32,I cannot wait until Dubas stupidly extends this playoff hope more and more. I need to see these fuckers go into a 10 year rebuild just like the Wings. Years of utter shit.
bluejackets,lxdffau,2024-11-15 21:41:20,They wouldn’t understand a rock if it hit them in the head.
bluejackets,lxdbvoe,2024-11-15 21:17:38,God I love that idea???Cannot wait to have KJ back this is going to be disgusting when he is. 
bluejackets,lxdcypm,2024-11-15 21:24:45,Let me guess.. her uncle lived in Pittsburgh for 6 months back in the day so she’s just always loved the Penguins and Steelers but mysteriously not the Pirates?
bluejackets,lxb04s9,2024-11-15 13:30:47,I miss Dubinsky consistently making life miserable for 87 while on the ice in NWA.
bluejackets,lxd72w7,2024-11-15 20:46:37,I'm too sober to start dancing in public or I absolutely would.I am however tempted to play the Whip on repeat and 'forget' my ear buds lmfao
bluejackets,lxd9fzt,2024-11-15 21:01:40,Same honestly.But I haven't gone to a game in like a month and I figure we'll just leave if they get too much worse lol
bluejackets,lxd3bt1,2024-11-15 20:22:18,Their color guy is pretty annoying. Play by play guy isn't terrible.
bluejackets,lxcuf5m,2024-11-15 19:26:22,It sure was everything about that was sickLove to see it genuinely
bluejackets,lxcw2ba,2024-11-15 19:36:29,Centering!
bluejackets,lxdcpqf,2024-11-15 21:23:04,I’m feeling skinny Tony
bluejackets,lxcring,2024-11-15 19:08:23,So dumb
bluejackets,lxczgsv,2024-11-15 19:57:31,I think about that goal like bimonthly.
bluejackets,lxcz68w,2024-11-15 19:55:41,Except the game at the end of the 22-23 season where Johnny scored in OT and sank our chance at the best lottery odds. Talk about bittersweet.
bluejackets,lxd4xl4,2024-11-15 20:32:44,Jimmy Malatesta too
bluejackets,lxdfmu3,2024-11-15 21:42:44,He scored again in overtime lol.
bluejackets,lxdfa9r,2024-11-15 21:40:23,I call them 39ers. CBJ fans for 39/41 home games. Buncha Benedicthead Arnolds.
bluejackets,lxdg7uv,2024-11-15 21:46:44,He might find a way to be worse than the 2nd stint of Jim Rutherford.
bluejackets,lxdfjau,2024-11-15 21:42:05,Sadly true. It's okay they just ate six goals from the grieving team c:
bluejackets,lxdc1x6,2024-11-15 21:18:45,He’s going on the road trip with them tomorrow. It sounds like it’s gonna be KJ time real soon
bluejackets,lxclpcl,2024-11-15 18:32:45,Me too.
bluejackets,lxdbopx,2024-11-15 21:16:20,good call. they're the only ones I usually for some reason have a hard time with. The Leafs fans always seem to fight amongst themselves (twice I've seen them removed in cuffs squabbling plus ive partied qith a few of them) and Boston fans sem to actually have a sense of humor most times. Pens fans are like Steelers fans. fuck em all lolol
bluejackets,lxcrqkb,2024-11-15 19:09:43,I know it’s annoying :(
bluejackets,lxdi23y,2024-11-15 21:59:06,The kid looks pretty pretty pretty good.
bluejackets,lxdcclt,2024-11-15 21:20:42,Oh shit that's great news!! I figured he was fairly close with his extended skating session recently but that's still way ahead of what I'd hoped.
bluejackets,lxcs4ue,2024-11-15 19:12:10,They’re going to smash the pens and we’ll miss it live lol
bluejackets,lx9qvwu,2024-11-15 09:44:13,Better to just make a donation to his foundation if you want to honor him
bluejackets,lx9myud,2024-11-15 09:22:34,I don't believe so. They donated a lot of thebstuff that was left out front. Namely food and drinks.I'd be willing to guess they kept select items.
bluejackets,lxa7tki,2024-11-15 11:10:54,We were at the game with Winnipeg and the Johnny memorial that was by the entrance had all been taken down
bluejackets,lxa19s4,2024-11-15 10:38:11,Good idea!
bluejackets,lx9qf2f,2024-11-15 09:41:41,They kept the sticks and memorabilia like that.
bluejackets,lxazp0g,2024-11-15 13:28:39,They still have a memorial inside but it’s roped off and the OP wouldn’t be able to leave any items at this point
bluejackets,lxb0pku,2024-11-15 13:33:35,We have season tickets and that’s the memorial I’m talking about. At the top of the stairs and escalator by the entrance facing the McConnell garage. It was there for the 10/28 game with the Oilers but gone at the 11/1 game with the Jets
bluejackets,lxb0wjo,2024-11-15 13:34:34,Wow I was only there a couple weeks ago so I’m surprised it’s gone already!
bluejackets,lxbwnf4,2024-11-15 16:15:17,It’s actually moved not gone. It’s right next to fan zone over by 118
bluejackets,lx9rexm,2024-11-15 09:47:06,We need the morale boost. Beating even a sickly penguins team and not very good Habs would do a lot.
bluejackets,lx9r7z5,2024-11-15 09:46:03,Pens home games are always huge. Let’s hope that the barn isn’t filled w 87 jerseys as it has been in the past.Let’s really really hope there isn’t a Pens fan on the Zamboni as we have seen in the past
bluejackets,lxaalok,2024-11-15 11:24:33,i think we gotta sprinkle the wins in throughout the season to keep things from getting too bleak but we should be picking top 3 again this team needs more true high end talent than we have in the pipeline. cant get stuck icing a roster of adam fantilli and a bunch of middle 6 forwards and second pair defensemen.personally more than wins i'd love to just see fantilli be a real factor over the next 3 games. his on-ice numbers have made him look like a black hole in the lineup and his individual production hasn't been impressive either. its not his fault he was forced to focus on rehabbing the leg almost all summer rather than improving his game but it'd be great to see him be a positive out there. he was when he was on monahan's wing in anaheim. wish they would have left him there.
bluejackets,lx969ib,2024-11-15 07:39:15,Man I'd love to start getting some bodies back
bluejackets,lxa4msh,2024-11-15 10:54:58,im actually cackling out loud at the combo of this being posted at 2:30am columbus time and also you citing your source as puckpedia when this was an official announcement from CBJ and the monsters yesterday after practice lolgreat to see him finally playing again tho for sure
bluejackets,lx111l7,2024-11-13 21:59:01,I usually don't go to Pens games because every time the Pens fans are just fucking awful. At least you seem cool
bluejackets,lx121lh,2024-11-13 22:05:11,It’s Yinzerpalooza on Friday. I work the visitors bench most games so I’ll likely see you and a lot of other black and yellows in 105 on Friday. Have a great time and thanks for spending your Friday in our barn.
bluejackets,lx2kmtd,2024-11-14 06:26:18,if you must wear yellow in our house do us a favor - Can you tell every other penguins fan to dial the dickhead behavior way way way down? I’ve seen every team in the NHL come through Nationwide Arena as both a fan and former employee of the arena and Penguins fans are easily the worst behaved people in the league. By a mile.
bluejackets,lx104ee,2024-11-13 21:53:24,You’re cool Pens fan. I like you.
bluejackets,lx5p6xf,2024-11-14 16:59:54,Pens suck.  Hard.  Porno actress hard.
bluejackets,lxbxexg,2024-11-15 16:19:11,Tampa fan here but in so excited to make it to the game tonight also. I live in Ohio so CBJ will always be my second favorite team and everytime  I've been to nationwide when they play the bolts everyone has been awesome. Let's go jackets!
bluejackets,lx9gwiz,2024-11-15 08:47:18,Pens fans aren't actually all that bad it's just that there are a lot of them when they come to town. Which makes sense because our team has historically sucked really hard and Pittsburgh has been mostly pretty good my whole life and with some all time hall of fame greats. Obviously this attracts more people. I'm sure tickets are cheaper here than Pittsburgh too.
bluejackets,lxfhwot,2024-11-16 08:37:55,Well……YOU’RE WELCOME!!
bluejackets,lxg14cq,2024-11-16 10:39:32,Thanks for coming!
bluejackets,lxgjfy9,2024-11-16 12:19:32,Were you in section 122 by chance?
bluejackets,lx1mgwr,2024-11-14 00:31:25,That sucks to hear because my experiences have been mostly good. Last game I went to with my brother. A bunch of Pens fans started Let Go Pens chants in R-Bar before the game but then lots of us took pictures with Jackets fans making sad faces while they pointed at us and made faces after the game because we got creamed.  We had a good time and all bought each other drinks and BS'ed about hockey and sports stuff in general. This was probably 8-9 years ago.
bluejackets,lx5nft3,2024-11-14 16:50:58,I can assure you the dickheads will not count me and the Mrs. among their number haha. I actually have several musician friends in Columbus and hoping to meet up with one or two the next day before we head home. Planning to check out Otherworld too the Mrs. wants to see it.
bluejackets,lx6fyak,2024-11-14 19:23:23,Five cups one team
bluejackets,lxcddj4,2024-11-15 17:43:59,Well this season I think we’ll be giving you a run for the money on who’s worse. I’m ready for the rebuild.

bluejackets,lx0i30h,2024-11-13 20:05:12,It's showing up for me on ESPN on Hulu.
bluejackets,lx0i7dg,2024-11-13 20:05:57,Yep. Me too. Very odd.
bluejackets,lx0ilfx,2024-11-13 20:08:20,Same here

bluejackets,lx0tvag,2024-11-13 21:15:29,ESPN+ broke something in their system setup because Carolina/Utah has the same issue. Or maybe ESPN's way to tell me I should get some sleep tonight instead.
bluejackets,lx0ujbm,2024-11-13 21:19:31,I can get pens redwings on Max but I can’t get anything on ESPN+ even with VPN.

bluejackets,lx6gn7n,2024-11-14 19:27:11,Sorry I saw this so late... but yes I tried to watch the Cap-Leafs game using ESPN+ and I was told it was blacked out.  WTF?
bluejackets,lx0i7sb,2024-11-13 20:06:02,Well played 
bluejackets,lx0keif,2024-11-13 20:19:08,Why do people comment like this. You can streameast or sports surge or methstreams or crackstreams. It doesn’t matter
bluejackets,lx0id1o,2024-11-13 20:06:56,I do have ESPN+ through spectrum so maybe it’s another pissing contest
bluejackets,lx0v291,2024-11-13 21:22:45,Thanks this is working for me too on Hulu.  Just not on the ESPN app.
bluejackets,lx0uyez,2024-11-13 21:22:06,Correction ESPN+ is working through Hulu but not the ESPN app.
bluejackets,lx0klf1,2024-11-13 20:20:17,Brother that's a no no

tampabaylightning,lxsy0wl,2024-11-18 14:25:49,there’s a facebook group that lightning season ticket holders sell their tickets on without fees. you might not be received well there as a cats fan. you know how people are. still worth a try. i personally wouldn’t buy anything off reddit.
tampabaylightning,lxtdq98,2024-11-18 15:45:36,I knowww convenient for us Floridians but my God you just know the families are gonna have messed up photos this year lol

tampabaylightning,lxsjhfc,2024-11-18 13:13:04,That's well deserved from all 3 this week love seeing Vasy up there tearing it up
tampabaylightning,lxsn6tl,2024-11-18 13:31:37,How does Mason Marchment not make the 1st star? He out performed McDavid
tampabaylightning,lxsvv3s,2024-11-18 14:15:00,>Vasilevskiy became the fastest goaltender in League history to reach the  going 2-0-0 with a 0.50 goals-against average .981 save percentage and one shutout as the Lightning (9-6-1 19 points) won both of their games.Good reporting there NHL. I guess we'll never know what he reached.
tampabaylightning,lxstd45,2024-11-18 14:02:29,Great to see again!
tampabaylightning,lxu1rzq,2024-11-18 17:49:36,#1 BullshitVassy deserves first star best star #1 star!
tampabaylightning,lxsoh03,2024-11-18 13:38:04,McDavid - Draisaitl = Conor Sheary
tampabaylightning,lxsv9q6,2024-11-18 14:12:02,Because McDavid is the chosen one.
tampabaylightning,lxu2to7,2024-11-18 17:55:23,It’s probably because he reached 1000 points similarly to how Vasy hit 300 wins
tampabaylightning,lxu583d,2024-11-18 18:08:58,Came here looking for this comment. IMO the order should be reversed.
tampabaylightning,lxt57ku,2024-11-18 15:02:06,.981 over 2 games lol that's just silly
tampabaylightning,lxu1jxw,2024-11-18 17:48:24,Because maths
tampabaylightning,lxt2hz5,2024-11-18 14:48:25,I know but come on. Mason helped me win fantasy last week and that makes him a 1 star to me
tampabaylightning,lxt5e39,2024-11-18 15:03:01,Go back over 3 games. 3 goals allowed total. The big cat is definitely hot.
tampabaylightning,lxt5u6g,2024-11-18 15:05:20,3 GA in 3 games is crazy but what's crazier is we expect it from this guy like that's another goalies best stretch of his career for Vasy it was a Tuesday
tampabaylightning,lxs2i20,2024-11-18 11:47:36,That’s our Kuch. I’m sure there will be no news about itWhile you’re at it do you want to find out the fastest wingers to 1000pts and where he is on pace for?
tampabaylightning,lxs1bwj,2024-11-18 11:41:40,I apologize in advance if I made any grammatical errors that would this hard to read

tampabaylightning,lxs4874,2024-11-18 11:56:18,Mike bossy scored 1000 in like 630 games (dude was an animal) Kurri did it in like 750 games And Jágr did it in like 805 Kuch is currently on pace to do it in 802 which would make him the third fastest
tampabaylightning,lxsm0rl,2024-11-18 13:25:47,What makes you think there wouldn't be news about it?
tampabaylightning,lxtvz64,2024-11-18 17:18:22,It auto corrected it’s not that big of a deal I understand it’s Jágr not Jager

tampabaylightning,lxopta1,2024-11-17 20:23:45,Quite right my apologies. That’s just how they talk in Tucson Arizoña
tampabaylightning,lxnxvyx,2024-11-17 17:40:13,Did you have one of those bracelets (for the meet and greet)?  I heard they gave them away when the store opened.
tampabaylightning,lxo00ak,2024-11-17 17:52:20,Waited in line for him at international for like 2 hours 4 or so years ago and they ended the session right when i got to the front..
tampabaylightning,lxoace0,2024-11-17 18:52:43,Gotta go through Immortal Seats next time. I got to meet Vasy and Mac through them it’s a bit pricey but you get a GUARANTEE of getting your photo with them if you show up at the scheduled time. I went to the event last weekend and although it was expensive the photos were professional grade (better than some I’ve even gotten at comic cons with guys like Ewan McGregor) and you get multiple to choose from. There is another one coming up in December iirc let’s hope they can get him again especially since he seems to be doing more of these.https://preview.redd.it/b462x0hwuj1e1.jpeg?width=5568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a8aab1991026d3de494639e01d14d7204f839c9
tampabaylightning,lxqj67k,2024-11-18 05:30:59,I did a signing at Dicks with him a couple years ago.  Never again they rush you through tell you no pictures (like they will actually block phones even if you aren’t holding the line by having someone take photos for you).  You get to fist bump say hi he signs a low res lithograph and you’re pushed through.Then all the staff get to distastefully do all the things they prevented fans from doing right in front of everyone.
tampabaylightning,lxnxz6l,2024-11-17 17:40:44,They had a separate line and said everyone would get to meet him
tampabaylightning,lxnxx9z,2024-11-17 17:40:26,Nope
tampabaylightning,lxoxe8d,2024-11-17 21:10:26,Yeah what this guy said my fiancee saw a video about him doing meet and greets and signings at the convention center and surprised me with tickets. It was pricey like he says but we got a guarantee. Hes also super nice! Fiancée is pregnant with our first and Vasy said “oh nice I got 3 fans here” 
tampabaylightning,lxny8kz,2024-11-17 17:42:14,O that sucks. I'm sorry. My coworker was told there was no guarantee if you didn't have a braclet so they left after 30.
tampabaylightning,lxnhcw9,2024-11-17 16:09:06,I don't care. The one timer is a meme for most teams there's other ways to score on the PP as evidenced by our all left shooting top unit the past few games.
tampabaylightning,lxnf00n,2024-11-17 15:57:01,Definitely a hindrance but there’s still more than enough talent on the PP for it to click eventually. I’d bet they’ll address it at the deadline if we’re still in contention.
tampabaylightning,lxnt578,2024-11-17 17:13:40,Strongly agree and it has been really highlighted with Point’s absense the last few games with the only other right shot forwards being Chaffee and Glenny primarily playing Bottom 6 minutes So many small details in-game that are missed out on because the left shot forward has a scoring opportunity on his backhand whereas if it’s a right shot forward it’s an easy tap in etc.
tampabaylightning,lxnelaf,2024-11-17 15:54:50,Been saying that for a while. Almost thinking about Raddysh trying wing until we find one.
tampabaylightning,lxnvlsm,2024-11-17 17:27:20,I feel like the big right hand one timer doesn’t work in playoff hockey. It’s been a staple for us in the regular season for a decade but it just feels like it doesn’t translate come playoff time.
tampabaylightning,lxogdau,2024-11-17 19:27:14,Even with how slow our powerplay was to start and it’s still not clicking as well as it could we’re 15th in the league at about 20% talent turns out to be more important that handedness
tampabaylightning,lxo7j48,2024-11-17 18:36:19,That's because the PK of teams in the playoffs is usually pretty good. Also they don't call as many penalties in the playoffs. So you can't rely on it.
tampabaylightning,lxn4mhs,2024-11-17 15:01:29,This looks great! I have a blue Stamkos jersey and a black alternate personalized one. Just last night I was thinking I would never buy the white alternate but if it looked like this I might.
tampabaylightning,lxnkn6r,2024-11-17 16:27:02,With all due respect I appreciate the design and it’s perfectly fine but every concept of the lighting goes back to this very retro style design.  The current Lightning logo is sleek modern and is so much sharper than the retro logo everyone seems to go to.
tampabaylightning,lxov7lo,2024-11-17 20:56:53,Very much like this  Best of the new and old.
tampabaylightning,lxnyr3f,2024-11-17 17:45:11,Looks very beer league to me. Like this is a default option on a custom jersey site kinda thing.
tampabaylightning,lxnwv5z,2024-11-17 17:34:20,It's nice
tampabaylightning,lxrsolc,2024-11-18 10:56:33,The design is good but I'm not a fan. I don't want to disparage your work I'm just not a fan of the look.  You did a quality design though.
tampabaylightning,lxsgvws,2024-11-18 12:59:52,I’ll give the A for effort but I’m personally not a fan of the design or colors.
tampabaylightning,lxn8z4q,2024-11-17 15:24:59,I like it I think it’s time to move away from the black alternates for a while
tampabaylightning,lxozk9x,2024-11-17 21:23:51,Ooo what would a yellow nameplate look like with this design? Similar to Philly. I think it might look really slick.
tampabaylightning,lxoxxyy,2024-11-17 21:13:52,I wish we could add purple to our colors. Not as a primary but for little accents for different uniform designs.
tampabaylightning,lxn93wy,2024-11-17 15:25:42,I kind of liked the white stadium series
tampabaylightning,lxne40h,2024-11-17 15:52:20,Rather go back to black full time. I miss it.
tampabaylightning,lxrstfu,2024-11-18 10:57:15,That would not look good.
tampabaylightning,lxm9uov,2024-11-17 12:16:12,FYI the event itself was on the 12th of November and has passed. But I found this randomly looking for independent bookstores and wanted to share it anyway for those interested in exploring in their own. You can also find clips across social media. 
tampabaylightning,lxnquqk,2024-11-17 17:00:59,Craziest part of The Sopranos was when Phil turned into that house
tampabaylightning,lxoyl4w,2024-11-17 21:17:47,Uncle Philly my ass!
tampabaylightning,lxoyp95,2024-11-17 21:18:30,20 years & not a peep. He compromised
tampabaylightning,lxp2taq,2024-11-17 21:44:02,Wish they explored that part of Philly's character. His ability to turn into a house was never hinted at. Unbravo Chase
tampabaylightning,lxp2pxo,2024-11-17 21:43:28,Take that piece of shit and get off my rink!
tampabaylightning,lxm7ud1,2024-11-17 12:04:59,Guessing that means Point is ready to return (good news!) but I thought Gage was really good and would've liked to see him stay up a little longer hopefully he gets another chance later in the season.
tampabaylightning,lxm82gs,2024-11-17 12:06:13,He is an easy call up with no issues in the world of waivers
tampabaylightning,lxmce7p,2024-11-17 12:30:19,I liked his play. Tough fast and had a few looks. Hope we keep him and see more of him.
tampabaylightning,lxmaktp,2024-11-17 12:20:15,Its tough when you get called up from the AHL against the 15-1 Jets and still have an okay game I thought he looked really good last night against a more-normal team in the Devils. The question is now is are they putting Cam back in and going 12/6 or are they going to keep things the way they are and go 11/7 with Point since its working so well?
tampabaylightning,lxmjw33,2024-11-17 13:11:32,Hopefully this is a paper transaction because he played a great game last night
tampabaylightning,lxmfghc,2024-11-17 12:47:20,He’s accruing cap space
tampabaylightning,lxn78ws,2024-11-17 15:15:42,Tv announcer pronounce his last name as Gonzales. What is with that?
tampabaylightning,lxotx96,2024-11-17 20:49:02,Cam over gonzo I guess
tampabaylightning,lxouyr9,2024-11-17 20:55:24,I thought they might keep him over Atkinson.
tampabaylightning,lxstki9,2024-11-18 14:03:32,I never want to see Atkinson again. Any chance of Goncalves being in the lineup wi the next couple games?
tampabaylightning,lxm85mr,2024-11-17 12:06:43,Or JBB wants to give someone else from the Crunch a look. Definitely would rather have Pointer.
tampabaylightning,lxmc1fj,2024-11-17 12:28:22,I really hope they stick with 11/7. The Paul-Guentzel combo is fire and I’d hate to separate them to keep trying to make cam work in the bottom 6.Edit: to add I know it won’t be exactly the same with point slotting back into the 1c spot but 11/7 gives a lot more opportunities for different line combos hence more Paul and Guentzel playing together.
tampabaylightning,lxml2ip,2024-11-17 13:17:52,Yeah I was really impressed. I expect we'll be seeing more of him soon bc Atkinson isn't suited to play in the NHL anymore. If we go back to 12/6 why wouldn't we have Gage in the lineup?
tampabaylightning,lxnd98b,2024-11-17 15:47:51,His last name is pronounced Gon-Zal-Ves
tampabaylightning,lxm8enm,2024-11-17 12:08:06,I mean it could be that but considering we just beat 2 of the best teams in the league with Goncalves in the lineup I don't know why you would change anything unless it's for Point coming back in
tampabaylightning,lxmegqi,2024-11-17 12:41:49,I don't think that's it. Gage has been playing great and has good chemistry with Geekie. My guess is Cooper might like the 11/7 we have right now and he wants Gage to keep playing. I just really really hope we're not seeing Atkinson again because he slows down the bottom six so much.
tampabaylightning,lxmfde1,2024-11-17 12:46:51,Honestly I'm completely fine with sticking to 11/7 and keeping the three core groups together. JG and Paul finding chemistry means we can more evenly distribute the load between the top 3 lines without worrying about overworking anyone. It's a little convoluted but we've been playing so well I really hope we ride this until we need to change it.? - Point - KuchHagel - Cirelli - ?JG - Paul - ?ZG - LG - ?The above allows Chaffee Geekie and Mikey to move around freely which I actually really like. Of course also double shifting Kuch JG etc.
tampabaylightning,lxrg5si,2024-11-18 09:46:59,Not Gon-cal-ves?
tampabaylightning,lxmj1m7,2024-11-17 13:06:59,Could be a paperwork transaction. Remember this year we are accruing cap space as we no longer have players in LTIR
tampabaylightning,lxmfo5w,2024-11-17 12:48:30,I’m 100% behind this but is Coop enough of a mad scientist to go for it? My gut says yes!
tampabaylightning,lxntsvd,2024-11-17 17:17:22,With all the conversation about 11-7 configuration we need to keep in mind that it means your putting a lot of pressure on the forwards and that wear and tear adds up. I’d prefer they find a way to get back to 12-6 combo and get it working. I’ve also noticed how good Jake & Paul are playing together this is a Tandem I’d explore during the rest of the year.  Think pairings Kuch/Point Paul/Guentzal Cirelli/Chaffee or Geekie and Glendenning/Gerginsons then fill in the blanks.
tampabaylightning,lxnugwu,2024-11-17 17:21:02,"We're not paying $9M for Guentzel to be a third-line winger. That's ridiculous. ""Moving around freely"" is not the way for the other lines to develop chemistry. Geekie is actually earning his spot in the top 6 with his play and his size and grit are a nice balance to Hagel and Cirelli plus teams won't necessarily know how to play him yet with him being a rookie. Paul's been playing really well and I'd love to see him get some PP1 time but he can 3C between Atkinson and Eyssimont. Goncalves plays a top-6 style which he won't get up here unless he stays here. He could/should push Atkinson and Eyssimont to up their games. That's the move for Coop to make."
tampabaylightning,lxrjdi5,2024-11-18 10:05:37,It's a soft c that sounds more like an s or z
tampabaylightning,lxmg8hm,2024-11-17 12:51:37,Feels silly to try to change things with how great everyone has been playing. Something I don't see mentioned is how adding in Raddysh seems to help stabilize the bottom pairing a bit more than any other combo we've seen. That alone makes it worth it.
tampabaylightning,lxocz5k,2024-11-17 19:08:02,Yeah he is.  Do you remember the last shootout loss.  Goncalves and Heddy.  Not my first choice for a shootout
tampabaylightning,lxoei5e,2024-11-17 19:16:50,>We're not paying $9M for Guentzel to be a third-line winger. That's ridiculous.He's had two multi point games in a row with 23/20 minutes TOI. Paul has 3 points over those two games 16/20 TOI. When you run 11/7 it allows you to give guys more minutes and has no bearing on where someone is in the lineup at any point. JG and Paul have great chemistry and having 3 forward lines contributing is great.
tampabaylightning,lxm2mpi,2024-11-17 11:36:16,That 6 day off time seemed to help. Boys have more energy. Tampa has been through a lot this year with the hurricanes.
tampabaylightning,lxmc44f,2024-11-17 12:28:46,I mentioned that last night. We started off flat so Coop gave the bottom 6 some more time and shook up the lines a bit. It totally worked.
tampabaylightning,lxmkm90,2024-11-17 13:15:27,Agreed seems like they did alot of back to basics coaching with things like line changes. Kinda feels like we can be our own worst enemy.  Whatever it was. I hope they do it again if needed.
tampabaylightning,lxnowgo,2024-11-17 16:50:21,And I was honestly worried since we usually come back from breaks and blow the first game or two!
tampabaylightning,lxlo8m8,2024-11-17 10:14:29,Lost me at Fanatics
tampabaylightning,lxqejm7,2024-11-18 04:40:12,looks sick. i’d buy one if it wasn’t fanatics
tampabaylightning,lxlrmwa,2024-11-17 10:34:31,All new jerseys are Fanatics this year but there are different tiers of quality.
tampabaylightning,lxm04t0,2024-11-17 11:22:36,What are the tiers? I know nothing about this but would love a high quality Lightning jersey
tampabaylightning,lxma1gj,2024-11-17 12:17:14,Practice and breakaways are the bottom and same quality the premiums are the same price and quality as the adidas retail sweaters and the top is the on ice made in Canada sweaters run about 400+
tampabaylightning,lxl5lbj,2024-11-17 08:06:39,Does Vasy have the stamina to break Marty’s 691 win record? Only time will tell.
tampabaylightning,lxljiza,2024-11-17 09:45:30,I think the weight of the stick surprised him too.
tampabaylightning,lxku199,2024-11-17 06:18:29,I don’t blame him this is basically one giant “getting happy birthday sung at you” scenario

tampabaylightning,lxremyx,2024-11-18 09:37:54,Audemars Piguet are considered higher end luxury than Rolex via craftsmanship etc.  They are also more expensive. If given a choice I'd always take an AP over Rolex though either would be nice :D
tampabaylightning,lxn29v3,2024-11-17 14:48:34,Not a Rolex box

edmontonoilers,lxtbw95,2024-11-18 15:36:22,TLDR without reading article:It's not great.
edmontonoilers,lxttlqm,2024-11-18 17:05:47,Meanwhile our departures seem to be doing well…https://thescore.com/nhl/news/3090824
edmontonoilers,lxu8dsv,2024-11-18 18:27:13,turns out retooling the entire depth squad isnt such a great idea for any aspect of this team lol. what was JJ thinking destroying any chemistry from our playoff pk & pp
edmontonoilers,lxtwcl9,2024-11-18 17:20:23,Foegle and McLeod > Arvidsson and Skinner as it turns out. Even Holloway is doing better.
edmontonoilers,lxu5l07,2024-11-18 18:11:02,Arvi and Skinner have been 10-ply so far.  Podz couldn’t score in a brothel and Emberson is not an improvement over Ceci.  As a group I’d give them a D+ pretty disappointing.
edmontonoilers,lxtrgy1,2024-11-18 16:54:47,Arvidsson has been fantastic... When he's available. Podz has been a breath of fresh air tbh but he could be contributing more offensively but I'm not upset at all.Emberson has been absolute dog shit I cannot believe we haven't replaced him with someone from Bakersfield. Ever since game 1 it feels like he can't go a game without causing a goal by just standing around and pointing for someone else to cover his man. Literal hockey terrorist. I hope Brown outplays him and steals his spot when Nurse returns.Skinner had so much hype and I'm beginning to get sick of his inability to score. He looks good out there but can't finish. Extremely disappointing.
edmontonoilers,lxtywx1,2024-11-18 17:34:09,Ryan McLeod would currently be 3rd in points on this year's Oilers.
edmontonoilers,lxu3ktf,2024-11-18 17:59:35,Also broberg had almost a point per game before getting hurt. JJ is trash 
edmontonoilers,lxtz3qw,2024-11-18 17:35:10,Podz is literally Puljujarvi 2.0 in the top 6 but worse.
edmontonoilers,lxtwtos,2024-11-18 17:22:56,Arvidsson fantastic? We’re not watching the same games.
edmontonoilers,lxty8hr,2024-11-18 17:30:29,Same with their take on Emberson. I'm not saying he's been great or anything but I think he's been ok. His underlying numbers are solid but the actual results have been bad. Obviously he has some impact on those results but he also has the worst 5v5 On Ice SV% of any skater on the team so I think you could argue that goaltending might be dragging him down in particular.
edmontonoilers,lxsgujq,2024-11-18 12:59:41,The meteor is sick
edmontonoilers,lxshdgb,2024-11-18 13:02:21,You're smokin rocks the original McFarlane alternate is sick. One of my favorite jerseys ever. I love the font on the nameplates too. Part of the reason is definitely nostalgia though I loved them as a kiddo.
edmontonoilers,lxsho0o,2024-11-18 13:03:50,I love the updated McFarlane and the Heritage Jerseys the most. The tide pod orange ones are the worst.
edmontonoilers,lxsh7t5,2024-11-18 13:01:33,It's good you just want something to complain about like everyone did when it came out
edmontonoilers,lxshwuw,2024-11-18 13:05:05,You shut your mouth
edmontonoilers,lxskjm6,2024-11-18 13:18:24,If you got a problem with the McFarlane you got a problem with me
edmontonoilers,lxsk0lu,2024-11-18 13:15:45,fuck that i love the oil meteor drop i wish i had one that didn't fit 11 year old me. can you even get them anymore?
edmontonoilers,lxskvc6,2024-11-18 13:20:02,Why do you repost everything from Instagram
edmontonoilers,lxsmacp,2024-11-18 13:27:07,The reverse retro McFarlane might be my favorite oilers jersey of all time
edmontonoilers,lxsic80,2024-11-18 13:07:14,When one of the owners of the team designs a logo you take it and you like it damnit. It's a nice logo but it's very 90s.
edmontonoilers,lxsjim3,2024-11-18 13:13:14,4 and 9 are my favourites. The darker jerseys always hit harder with me.
edmontonoilers,lxskbfk,2024-11-18 13:17:15,Man you be tripping for real
edmontonoilers,lxts6kq,2024-11-18 16:58:24,love that this is a bunch of Oilers legends and #1 picks and then there's... Pat Maroon
edmontonoilers,lxu90yj,2024-11-18 18:30:56,Name a better duo than oiler fans on Reddit and complaining about something.
edmontonoilers,lxsllou,2024-11-18 13:23:41,Or they just don't like it.
edmontonoilers,lxsss4p,2024-11-18 13:59:32,Mitchell and Ness did make one in the spring with Ryan Smyth’s name and number on it that was being sold through Ice District Authentics. It looks like it’s sold out in every size except small but I’d imagine if it did well in the larger sizes that they’ll eventually restock it or do another player in that design.
edmontonoilers,lxt00t3,2024-11-18 14:35:53,If you are confident in spotting fakes you can find them on places like eBay and Poshmark semi-regularly. There’s also the new Mitchell and Ness replicas but they are only available for a couple players and aren’t super faithful replicas in terms of the fit/cut but are otherwise pretty good quality.
edmontonoilers,lxsfr7z,2024-11-18 12:54:16,Considering how gruesome that looked that's not horrible 
edmontonoilers,lxsf7rr,2024-11-18 12:51:33,Nurse was really hitting his stride I felt confidence coming out of him. Getting sidelined with this completely unnessecary hit feels bad for those cheering him on to succeed.
edmontonoilers,lxsfryw,2024-11-18 12:54:22,I'm so glad it's not a season or career ending injury. 
edmontonoilers,lxski1i,2024-11-18 13:18:11,I just hope to hell he's not rushing back if he's concussed. Yeah we're kinda fucked without him but after seeing what happened to Khaira it's not worth losing him long term.
edmontonoilers,lxsgf4l,2024-11-18 12:57:34,Could have been a whole lot worse that’s for sure.  Could have been season ending if it was a bad concussion.   Hope the boys rally around each other for the next 5-10 days.
edmontonoilers,lxsl2sc,2024-11-18 13:21:03,I find it crazy how they never acknowledge concussions anymore.
edmontonoilers,lxslf23,2024-11-18 13:22:46,I’m honestly surprised it’s not longer it looked so bad. Here’s hoping he can pick up where he left off he was looking great before the hit
edmontonoilers,lxsm9gb,2024-11-18 13:26:59,That sounds unreasonably optimistic after the likely brain damage he suffered. I could barely pay attention to the rest of the game after that hit. Made me sick to my stomach to see that.
edmontonoilers,lxsmzb3,2024-11-18 13:30:34,Was so worried about him and felt sick to my stomach while watching it all go down. Amazing news could have been career ending. 5-10 days? Hockey players are warriors.
edmontonoilers,lxswufj,2024-11-18 14:19:55,All the Nurse haters are about to have a real rough watch seeing what this team is like without Nurse
edmontonoilers,lxsghwc,2024-11-18 12:57:56,Too soon.  We can afford to give him more rest.
edmontonoilers,lxshe2p,2024-11-18 13:02:26,Just when was starting to look good again. I hope this doesn’t set him back to square one.
edmontonoilers,lxsqroh,2024-11-18 13:49:36,That isn’t nearly as long as I was expecting. Thank fuck
edmontonoilers,lxspo23,2024-11-18 13:44:06,Hopefully he is back for the games against Colorado. Gives him 12 days and lets him get some practice in before the big games. If he has issues you don't play him on the back to back against Vegas and hopefully still have Josh Brown called up.
edmontonoilers,lxstal4,2024-11-18 14:02:07,Imagine if the suspension was directly correlated with time lost if a player is injured.
edmontonoilers,lxt0hbu,2024-11-18 14:38:12,Simple solution to dirtbags. They don't play or get paid until the injured player returns to the ice. If that is never then good riddance to a violent asshole.
edmontonoilers,lxsvelb,2024-11-18 14:12:44,The way his neck snapped around good thing there wasn’t any spinal damage. That was a lot of torque
edmontonoilers,lxtbwyj,2024-11-18 15:36:28,Give him ten days off minimum. That was on the button. There's no need to rush him back. Symptoms can be nasty and inconsistent.I'm still feeling the effects of two concussions I suffered in December 2023 and August 2024.
edmontonoilers,lxssv4u,2024-11-18 13:59:56,So concussions are now only 5-10 days?
edmontonoilers,lxsmu51,2024-11-18 13:29:51,Yup.  10 days feels like good news honestly.
edmontonoilers,lxsw9qy,2024-11-18 14:17:03,Im hoping its truly because he is actually able to come back within this time frame and not because its the bare minimum that the docs were comfortable with green lighting him for to appease Nurse and/or the Oilers execs. I hate how rather than letting themselves heal properly hockey players and management much rather play through an injury which can either cause the injury to persist longer or cause further complications down the line. Though it does seem like players nowadays are more conciencious around CTEs. FUBAR'd mobility is one thing practically guaranteed early onset dementia and other neurological complications not so much.
edmontonoilers,lxu2632,2024-11-18 17:51:45,"Awesome to know that Nurse will be out close to the exact amount of time Reaves will as well. Pretty brutal after seeing his neck basically on the swivel. I don't really care if Reaves had no clear ""intent"" to injure on the play because he went out and made a disgusting hit like that anyways and has a history of bad hits and ""pulling a guys hair out"" ?? I mean jesus christ dude.  Honestly I think this should have been a larger suspension I'm fine with it being short as Reaves is terrible anyways but this type of player should be punished longer. Nice to see a few on the leafs sub patting their backs after they secured the win. Good to know they won't be winning much of anything anytime soon."
edmontonoilers,lxsoz06,2024-11-18 13:40:35,Honestly I’ve felt like his play over the last couple of years has been because of niggling injuries. Just my own theory. This hits hard. Plus he’s a big part of the team’s leadership. I was so happy to see him hitting his stride again. Hopefully he comes back and continues.
edmontonoilers,lxstomp,2024-11-18 14:04:07,Imagine losing Klefbom Larsson (tragic) and Nurse to injury or circumstances. Woof.
edmontonoilers,lxsm2cc,2024-11-18 13:26:00,actually $8MM on LTIR would be pretty sweet but I don't wish for Nurse to be hurt at all or any player (Marchand notwithstanding)
edmontonoilers,lxsrdri,2024-11-18 13:52:37,I feel like this is exactly the kind of concussion players needs to sit and heal on for a bit but the macho hockey mentality puts em right back on the ice. He will have to play extra safe which isnt what we need from 1 of our big D Men. Otherwise you might see Lindros/Crosby/Kariya kinda symptoms.
edmontonoilers,lxsn017,2024-11-18 13:30:40,Fear over CTE litigation probably
edmontonoilers,lxsnrif,2024-11-18 13:34:31,"I think they are just being careful with information they give out to fans/viewers nowadays. Injuries are commonly hush hush about the details since teams will use it against each other so commonly.Focusing on someone's knee or ankle happens less when just told ""lower body injury"" fore example. Of course this is obviously a head injury and likely has concussion effects to it. But teams being quite to the outward media is always in the best interest of the player."
edmontonoilers,lxsp5bj,2024-11-18 13:41:28,I think the cut made it seem a lot worse than it actually was. He’s literally our teams player rep. on some players committee to do with CTE. They wouldn’t be committing to a 5-10 day timeline if he’d been seriously hurt.
edmontonoilers,lxt07st,2024-11-18 14:36:52,I agree.  If he was concussed which he almost certainly was then I would think he would need more time than that to recover.  I really hope they're not rushing him back here.
edmontonoilers,lxtkfyi,2024-11-18 16:19:14,"Realistically he might end up having post concussion issues. Last year Cale Makar tried to return to play after a concussion. Passed ""protocols"" only to end up getting another concussion from a pretty mild hit. Bruises and blood vessel irregularities which show up on scans are not part of the protocol. Congratulations you have a mild TBI... not get back out there!!"
edmontonoilers,lxt0xk2,2024-11-18 14:40:29,I've never seen a neck turn that far before it was scary af
edmontonoilers,lxtoqm2,2024-11-18 16:40:58,I mean this is a thing in every sport. In hockey it's pretty mindblowing for how physical the game is and how insane the schedule in due to that. But in the World Series everyone knew Freddy Freeman was playing on a bad ankle (and he wasn't letting that effect his baserunning) and it seems like the Dodger's may have downplayed Ohtani's injury suffered when he was caught stealing because he went for shoulder surgery after the World Series (I think a week or two after the parade?).It's a tough situation we want these people to make decisions with their long-term health in mind but these are also athletes being paid a lot of money to play a game and they want to win management wants to win and when you have long seasons winning often means playing injured and working with some load management to try to make things easier on your players when possible. I just hope these are conversations that are happening without management in the room and with confidence that confidentiality is honoured. Because it's one thing for a player to decide to put off surgery or what-have-you in a conversation with their doctor it's another thing if management is exerting some influence on that decision.
edmontonoilers,lxt4sqe,2024-11-18 15:00:00,The replies to this post are confusing. Do people not know niggling is a word?
edmontonoilers,lxssdw7,2024-11-18 13:57:35,Niggling injuries are the worst 
edmontonoilers,lxty189,2024-11-18 17:29:24,Sekera
edmontonoilers,lxsrsc1,2024-11-18 13:54:38,Disagree. Nurse isn't worth his contract but losing him would be catastrophic. We don't have any assets to trade and 2nd line dmen for a contender don't grow on trees. We'd also be super fucked financially when he came backAlthough writing this out it would give the option to go for an expensive goalie at the tradeline throw anyone on the D and hope the combination of scoring goals and having an incredible goalie wins it. Of course we'd still be completely fucked when nurse returns but less than I initially thought.
edmontonoilers,lxt2lp0,2024-11-18 14:48:56,Doctors check them out now and ours are quite good on the rest times.I think nurse got lucky.
edmontonoilers,lxt0qke,2024-11-18 14:39:30, Nah his head turned almost backwards I didn't care about the blood it was just from his visor.  He could have broken his neck.
edmontonoilers,lxu7yzv,2024-11-18 18:24:50,I doubt they are the Oilers have doctors that know more about the situation than we do.
edmontonoilers,lxt68k6,2024-11-18 15:07:23,I’m guessing so. And even if they do they think it’s related.
edmontonoilers,lxt5rq9,2024-11-18 15:04:58,Shit. If I’m right in why you’re laughing it’s because of the similarity to another word that is highly inappropriate. But this is a normal word in my vocabulary and a quick look at its etymology suggests they aren’t related. But I may dig deeper into it (I’m a linguist so I find it interesting and I’d really like to know).
edmontonoilers,lxt0an8,2024-11-18 14:37:16,Can you imagine why that was in the suggestions for auto correct

edmontonoilers,lxssohj,2024-11-18 13:59:02,yeah I didn't think about the fact that we have no assets to trade. if we got skinner off the books $10MM (roughly) for a rent-a-goalie and a couple 2nd line blue liners could work ....I mean we could get 2 blue liners for nurse's price
edmontonoilers,lxtawzp,2024-11-18 15:31:23,I just thought it was a typo honestly didn't think that was an actual word I thought you were trying to say nagging
edmontonoilers,lxt63up,2024-11-18 15:06:44,It wasn’t an autocorrect and is unrelated to the word you’re thinking of. Perhaps I should have noticed its similarity but I never thought of it.
edmontonoilers,lxsw03e,2024-11-18 14:15:42,There's really only 1 goalie and he wants >12MM. Get rid of a pick to lose skinner and we'd have like $5MM to fill up the blue line. Get a partner for Kulak and anybody to settle in behind. It wouldn't be pretty but it might work. Like I said though the instant nurse returns from LTIR next season with a ton of other contracts coming up it's over.
edmontonoilers,lxtbztm,2024-11-18 15:36:51,niggling and nagging would be somewhat related in this context
edmontonoilers,lxtgtcy,2024-11-18 16:01:01,I got a brother named Nigel so we'd often call him Nige Niggy Piggy Niggy Nig. Like that's just some of the abbreviated ways we'd use to say his name and nick names so you don't even think about it. But there was definitely times where other people were in earshot and didn't understand the context of us calling our brother and gave us some very judging eyes.
edmontonoilers,lxth0y5,2024-11-18 16:02:05,"Lol I know I shouldn't have went for the joke but tbh there's a reason 99.9% of sportscasters and people I talk to say ""nagging"" injuries instead."
edmontonoilers,lxsx2cr,2024-11-18 14:21:01,oh yeah true but I feel like next season it's all over anyway. last year was our best window. with the big 3 resigning we'll have less space to plug holes then we did last year. I'm sure there are a few goalies out there for cheaper than that price but in the end we'd pay more than skinner's contract.I don't even want to think about next offseason TBH I can't wrap my head around it yet.
edmontonoilers,lxu8k6w,2024-11-18 18:28:16,Did you not see the news?  The cap has a chance to be almost 10% more next year.
edmontonoilers,lxu93li,2024-11-18 18:31:21,Leon Conner and Evan will get / have got more than 10% increases...

edmontonoilers,lxsimys,2024-11-18 13:08:46,Feel bad for J Skinner to be on 4th line playing 8-10 minutes.. I understand he had a couple of bad games.. but then you don’t want to penalize one guy.. everyone had bad games..  he is a pure scorer.. give him time to play with some talent and allow to grow some chemistry.. it will benefit the team..  I have a feeling he is already identified as the whipping boy for this season…
edmontonoilers,lxrwq2v,2024-11-18 11:17:54,Habs fan here (Oilers is my 2nd favorite team). Fucking can't wait to finally see the Oilers (especially McDavid and Draisaitl) in action at the Bell Centre!! Let's hope this is a good one!!
edmontonoilers,lxsc546,2024-11-18 12:36:18,Need some players to wake up. Nuge Hyman and Skinner need to show some fight. If you aren't scoring make sure you aren't giving the puck away and losing board battles. These guys have been poor in multiple ways. For all the shit Bouch gets (and rightfully for 2 GA) he's been good this season. Aforementioned three have not. Can I just shout out Janmark for a second? This dude's intensity is something impressive. There was a play in the second or third period where he was having in the corner against two leafs and just out worked them to get the puck out. He may at times have hands of stone but this guy always brings the intensity. Also with Skinner's struggles no reason not to ride Pick more going forward. I think we'll bounce back with a win.
edmontonoilers,lxrk17f,2024-11-18 10:09:22,Similar to how the entire team stepped up offensively with the McDavid injury the same is going to happen with the Nurse injury except everybody will have more attention to defense in his absenceThis is gonna be a tough game though the Habs always play us hard. They're the Flames of the East.

edmontonoilers,lxrro4f,2024-11-18 10:51:10,I noticed that the crowd sound was incredibly loud last game. Not the crowd itself but rather the audio mixing. Has anyone else noticed that of late? With all the praise going on for Amazon I have seen specific comments praising the louder crowd sound. I'm wondering if Sportsnet is trying to do that in turn? It's really made commentary hard to hear though. They don't seem to do any sort of frequency mixing though just literally turning a volume knob.
edmontonoilers,lxrsimt,2024-11-18 10:55:41,I’m gonna put on my best enthusiastic face. C’mon boys. Win it for Nurse.
edmontonoilers,lxt18ay,2024-11-18 14:42:00,Leon at 24 pts Connor at 21 pts. the next forwards are Hyman/Nuge/Janmark at 8 Skinner at 6 Arvidsson at 5.Stu and Bouch are easy scapegoats for when we lose but when are people going to talk about this? We spent a lot on offensive upgrades did the bare minimum to address the void left behind by losing Ceci/Broberg just to end up entirely relying on McDrai anyway.
edmontonoilers,lxrw4ka,2024-11-18 11:14:46,Going to the game in person. Wish me luck guys!
edmontonoilers,lxs1owb,2024-11-18 11:43:30,We can be two points out of first place and still have shit goaltending. Oilers solution to shitty tending is outscoring the opponent.

Both fun crochet involves a little more thinking which can be helpful when the game devolves like it did in Toronto but also you can miss out.

edmontonoilers,lxtxk7v,2024-11-18 17:26:52,Win tonight and you jump Van and CGY.  See if they can get it done. Not hopeful with this current D core.
edmontonoilers,lxrpyip,2024-11-18 10:42:02,Hoping for a bounce back game from Stu and Bouch. I know it's hard not to be super critical of them right now (and they deserve it) but Stu has a career SV% of .907 and back to back 50 game seasons above .900. We know he can be way better than he has this season. A .905 SV% is literally all the team needs. And Bouch was super elite last year. Defensive mistakes will probably always be a part of his game but hopefully he can at least get the offense going to make up for it. I know these guys can and will be better. Same goes for Nuge and Hyman but their issues aren't as directly detrimental as Stu/Bouch. It's kind of a miracle McDavid and Drai are still producing the way they are with those 2 guys combining for 4 goals so far lol. A low GA defensive showcase with some McDrai magic and a few depth goals would be nice. I hate the Habs so I'd love a blowout but a win without going to OT is all I'm asking for.
edmontonoilers,lxsy7y8,2024-11-18 14:26:48,The Oilers always have a tough time on this trip. I don't know if it's that the bars are too good or what but they always have flat games against Montreal and Ottawa. Hopefully they can pull out wins here.
edmontonoilers,lxscaa9,2024-11-18 12:37:01,Anyone else not the least bit sad that HymanBouch Nuge Skinner might not make Canada? Getting almost an entire month off will be money for the stretch run. Hopefully with a healthy dose of something to prove after.

edmontonoilers,lxsyz8i,2024-11-18 14:30:36,Will  Oilers have Josh the tough  Brown bear   on defense???   Trust Pickory more!!??
edmontonoilers,lxry930,2024-11-18 11:25:54,Somewhat unrelated but I think when a player gets suspended for injuring another player they should be suspended for the number of games that they are suspended plus the number of games that the player they injured misses. So if nurse misses 3 games Reeves is suspended for 3+5.

edmontonoilers,lxsxt6k,2024-11-18 14:24:45,Skinner did get moved up to play with Drai in the second half of the last game. He played almost as much with Drai as he did with Ryan. The starting lineup is just the starting lineup. Things change quickly. And it doesn't take much for a player to show that they're absorbing the defensive structure the coaches are teaching. Skinner is getting the opportunities he earns.
edmontonoilers,lxtbdla,2024-11-18 15:33:45,It’s stupid. Bouchard literally costs us games and he has the highest TOI for d-men. But yeah demote J Skinner cause he’s not lighting up immediately. Coaching decisions make no sense sometimes.

edmontonoilers,lxso989,2024-11-18 13:36:59,Good point about Janmark. Brown too. Those guys bring it every shift. Though it helps that expectations-wise we don’t really expect big offensive numbers from them.

edmontonoilers,lxrz69c,2024-11-18 11:30:39,This is Oilers hockey.The opposing goaltender is going to have a vezina performance their forwards are all going to look like prime Crosby and we'll get several closeups of McDavid and Drai shaking their head.

edmontonoilers,lxs01x1,2024-11-18 11:35:11,I thought so too - that they had heard so much positive feedback from Toronto fans over the Amazon broadcast that they perhaps realized they screwed up by muting it.They don't mute so hard in any other building so I don't know why they were in Toronto. But the other night you could hear crowd chants etc.
edmontonoilers,lxt4zya,2024-11-18 15:01:00,Its tough because those secondary group of forwards are still generating chances its their lack of finish. Hyman should have another 5-6 goals himself.
edmontonoilers,lxt1ncm,2024-11-18 14:44:06,People have been talking about Nuge and Hyman all year
edmontonoilers,lxt1u20,2024-11-18 14:45:03,not scapegoats they are getting the criticism they have consistently earned this year
edmontonoilers,lxs5ym2,2024-11-18 12:05:09,"Oilers seem to be really good at trying to destroy goaltending careers.The only guy who's career they haven't destroyed in recent memory is Cam Talbot ""was so ass and costing us so many games"" then we trade him away and he's doing just fine everywhere else after an off-season to recharge after getting away from us.Fuck Campbell developed a substance abuse problem. The media and fans here are pretty ruthless.Dubnyk similarly had trended to below .900 playing for us with Dallas Eakin's SWARM DEFENSE playing in front of him - so clearly the problem was goaltending. After getting traded and having 12 months to reset mentally from this gongshow of a situation dude posted a .936 save percentage in half a season with the Wild."
edmontonoilers,lxs5esp,2024-11-18 12:02:20,Skinner on the 4th line unfortunately probably continues until the Oilers are either well above .500 or desperately need a shake up in the top 6. Unfortunately his results with McDavid or Draisaitl (in a small sample size) aren't good enough for a team that needs every win it can get right now.
edmontonoilers,lxrta3v,2024-11-18 10:59:43,How can this be I'm told our goaltending sucks and should be trading blows with the sharks for last place in the division.

edmontonoilers,lxtqem8,2024-11-18 16:49:24,> Bouch come on man concentrate!Him giving up on the play on that 3rd goal against was unacceptable. Ekholm's pestering forced him to go forehand (the side Bouch would have been on) and if he would have kept skating he probably could have been close enough for a stick lift there.I can probably forgive the blind pass up the middle into McDavid's ass because I like that he makes plays and sometimes all that good comes with a little bad like this. But c'mon dude that puck squeaked by you out of the zone you should be the hardest working guy on the ice trying to prevent that breakaway.
edmontonoilers,lxtxq70,2024-11-18 17:27:46,Hard for Bouch to concentrate... Kid can see two pucks at once.
edmontonoilers,lxrtelq,2024-11-18 11:00:22,to everyone critical of bouch this was a really interesting [article](https://oilersnation.com/news/edmonton-oilers-evan-bouchard-and-what-it-means-to-play-good-defence) about how bouch doesn’t pass the eye test when it comes to defense but is still amazing by all metrics. with that being said he did cost us the win. still a young player who’s gonna improve a lot. it’s so early in the season. playoff bouch was a different beast. people forget so quickly
edmontonoilers,lxsi5xm,2024-11-18 13:06:21,Yes I am extremely grinchy and stingy-feeling about any extra hockey they have to play. Sure maybe they *like* it and are all *honoured* and everything but what matters to me is what kind of shape they’re in for the fucking playoffs man.
edmontonoilers,lxsepea,2024-11-18 12:49:01,I’m a little sad for Nuge particularly because they said these rosters will likely be the Olympic rosters just a few changes but they can all still turn it on for 2026 still I suppose just more of an uphill battle
edmontonoilers,lxt2h1y,2024-11-18 14:48:17,none of them deserve a spot.
edmontonoilers,lxrkbao,2024-11-18 10:10:58,Last update was Jack saying he was up and walking around after the game signing autographs and joking. Guess we will see if he’s on ice today
edmontonoilers,lxrz59x,2024-11-18 11:30:31,What happens if it’s an extremely dirty hit and somehow the player isn’t injured? No suspension?
edmontonoilers,lxs65x2,2024-11-18 12:06:11,I'd suggest that another option might be the team of the offender face a consequence: How about the team have the cost of the victim player's salary moved to the offender team salary cap for a year? Not only would that make frequent offenders unsuitable for teams to keep around but also more serious the more valuable the player they hit?Just a thought...
edmontonoilers,lxromf0,2024-11-18 10:34:50,If Nurse plays and is actually 100% healthy he was made in the same lab as McDavid.
edmontonoilers,lxrqvmz,2024-11-18 10:46:58,I agree with benching bouch a game.  There has to be consequences.
edmontonoilers,lxsaf3v,2024-11-18 12:27:40,This will get downvoted to oblivion but Bouchard played a good game vs the leafs and then his stretch pass deflected off McDavids skate into Knies. Sure you can make the argument being up by one he should be making a safer play but he’s our best puck mover and he’s paid to do it. On the second goal yea he should be skating harder. With that said Skinner had 3 business days to get to that puck before the leaf.
edmontonoilers,lxrsalb,2024-11-18 10:54:29,Da Bears are ridiculously terrible against the Packers for long stretches. It’s crazy.
edmontonoilers,lxtxmev,2024-11-18 17:27:12,Or breaking someone's face with his fists\*
edmontonoilers,lxu5uou,2024-11-18 18:12:34,So everything we have yet to see this year.  Such a frustrating team to love.  Sigh
edmontonoilers,lxrp3dv,2024-11-18 10:37:24,O
edmontonoilers,lxs10in,2024-11-18 11:40:05,Even better if our top D doesn’t give the puck away 2 feet in front of him
edmontonoilers,lxt0ek3,2024-11-18 14:37:49,Not gonna happen Cause Picks is in net. Still a Stu fan though.
edmontonoilers,lxtbh7b,2024-11-18 15:34:15,Are you asking?
edmontonoilers,lxrn652,2024-11-18 10:26:54,I would love to get him.
edmontonoilers,lxry3qn,2024-11-18 11:25:07,And yet people in here want to sit Bouch?
edmontonoilers,lxu5x8h,2024-11-18 18:12:58,Mcloud wouldn't have cracked the line up IF our new recruits performed at expectation likely not much ice time for Holloway either...Broberg stings still
edmontonoilers,lxtmrt8,2024-11-18 16:30:59,I’m pretty sure all those young guys are injured
edmontonoilers,lxu3zle,2024-11-18 18:01:54,I hate that I just read through all your bullshit. I wish there was an ai bot that deleted shit like this before it caught my eye.
edmontonoilers,lxtzirl,2024-11-18 17:37:24,What a dumb fucking take holy wow.
edmontonoilers,lxrvzxb,2024-11-18 11:14:06,Lol
edmontonoilers,lxsdn5a,2024-11-18 12:43:45,Seriously? You don't like watching hockey?Ahhhhh you are a winning team fan not a hockey fan. I get it.
edmontonoilers,lxslwts,2024-11-18 13:25:15,still out with an unknown injury
edmontonoilers,lxszuwb,2024-11-18 14:35:03,I think it was less him getting moved up and more an 11-7 thing where Drai was acting as the 4c. I've noticed Skinner a lot more the last two games though hoping the dam breaks soon!
edmontonoilers,lxt5fuh,2024-11-18 15:03:16,He's tied for 3rd for points form a forward with Hyman and RNH at 8.Drai McDavid lead the team with 24 and 21 points and then its Bouch (10) Ek (10) and Nurse (9).
edmontonoilers,lxsalw7,2024-11-18 12:28:36,Nuge - McDavid - Hyman is just such a good line. Despite Nuge and Hyman combining for 3 5v5 goals this year (and McDavid only having 3 himself) they have a GF% of 61.9. And that's with a PDO of .955. They're dominating despite getting pretty unlucky. Makes it hard to break the line up even if individuals aren't producing.
edmontonoilers,lxs7785,2024-11-18 12:11:30,TBF he can and will play any position competently almost surprised he hasn't moved to goalie somehow given how bad our current tendies look lately. 
edmontonoilers,lxsarnq,2024-11-18 12:29:25,Ehhhh as Habs fan smth is pretty off right now. Not working as hard as last year though it is getting better. Personally I think it’s the quadrillion injuries every year is getting to them but eh. I feel like Draisatl is gonna be the reason Oilers win if they do for some reason how has he been?
edmontonoilers,lxsc8nr,2024-11-18 12:36:47,Don't think they've disclosed it. He was listed as day-to-day after the Islanders game. Practiced in Toronto but did not play not at practice today.
edmontonoilers,lxsonxr,2024-11-18 13:39:03,“Lower body” injury. Dumb vague disclosures all season these days. Must have stubbed his toe coming out of the shower or something.
edmontonoilers,lxsif8k,2024-11-18 13:07:40,Arvidsson is bad news but 5-10 days for Nurse is significantly better than I was expecting.
edmontonoilers,lxt890w,2024-11-18 15:17:47,But they're making errors because they're being forced into roles above their pay-grade at this point. Bouch should be a 2nd pairing D but has by far the highest TOI on our team (and some of the highest in the entire league). Stu should be a backup goalie but had the 3rd most games played last season of any goalie.These guys suffer so the team gets to spend more of their budget on forwards and then said forwards proceed to underperform wildly.
edmontonoilers,lxs6pj8,2024-11-18 12:08:58,Fans and media are doing to Skinner what they did to Dubnyk.Going to ruin a good goaltender who's going through a bit of a rough start to the year.Dude brought us to G7 SCF and it's still not good enough for some fucks.
edmontonoilers,lxs73j6,2024-11-18 12:10:59,The Oilers are getting zero secondary scoring right now. Nuge Arvy Hyman and Podz have a combined goal total of 6 between them in almost 20 games. One could argue the top 6 *is* desperately in need of a shakeup. Or play him with Henrique then idc - anyone is better than DR.
edmontonoilers,lxsc9pf,2024-11-18 12:36:56,But the results from the other top 6 forwards are?This has to the be the dumbest comment I have seen on this sub
edmontonoilers,lxs7v59,2024-11-18 12:14:50,By every metric it does.League average goaltending would have this team near the top of the NHL
edmontonoilers,lxsb0a5,2024-11-18 12:30:36,5-10 days as per Knob this morning.
edmontonoilers,lxryssw,2024-11-18 11:28:43,Yeah even this year Bouch has an xGF% of 63. The problem is his actual GF% is 53.7%. Now a big part of that is the low on ice SH% and Skinner's poor start but plays like the 2 GA against Toronto have also played a big part. A positive GF% and 10 points in 18 games certainly isn't bad for a defenceman playing top pairing minutes but it's a far cry from the 1+ P/GP defenceman with a GF% of 61 he was last year. Bouch is getting more flak than he deserves because his last game was so atrocious but he hasn't been nearly as good as we know he can be.
edmontonoilers,lxrv2zf,2024-11-18 11:09:17,The problem with Bouch is his errors/lack of effort are critical especially last game. Analytics will tell you differently but what the fanbase sees during the game is what you will see most people complain about.
edmontonoilers,lxsj21w,2024-11-18 13:10:54,Might just be Mcjeez and Ekholm from our team!
edmontonoilers,lxrmc91,2024-11-18 10:22:22,I don’t feel he will play today and tomorrow.. mainly because we recalled J Brown.. we already have 6 defenders without Nurse. If there was any chance of him playing these two games I don’t think they would have recalled Brown
edmontonoilers,lxrlm4a,2024-11-18 10:18:19,I'd guess gtd in that case. Him not going back home today would be good news to me
edmontonoilers,lxrnmd3,2024-11-18 10:29:21,That basically rules out everything besides light concussion no? Even if he doesn't play I hope that means hell be back pretty soon
edmontonoilers,lxrzuu9,2024-11-18 11:34:11,Or a 1-gamer but it’s against a guy with injury problems? The whole year? I like the idea but there are just too many unknowns for it to be fair. There could be like a template: concussion is 10 games etc. 
edmontonoilers,lxs5x7v,2024-11-18 12:04:58,They still just get the x game suspension just no extra because the receiving player didn’t miss any games.
edmontonoilers,lxrsdri,2024-11-18 10:54:57,I believe it’s the same lab that made Wolverine.
edmontonoilers,lxrzq9f,2024-11-18 11:33:33,There can be consequences without benching Bouch for a game when we're already down Nurse lol. Bouch is our #1 Dman by ATOI per game and at 5v5/ES. Nurse is 3rd for both. We'd be in huge trouble without those guys even against Montreal. Yell at him in the locker room bag skate him play him a few less minutes but benching him would be crazy.
edmontonoilers,lxrslym,2024-11-18 10:56:09,Smith wasn't benched in 86 after he scored in fuhr and cost us a cup.
edmontonoilers,lxrs3sy,2024-11-18 10:53:28,You can make him puke at practice and still keep him in.
edmontonoilers,lxsp2js,2024-11-18 13:41:05,Second goal lack of effort from Bouch is unforgivable
edmontonoilers,lxsb2g5,2024-11-18 12:30:54,Skinner was also standing way out of the net flat flooted like he fully expected the defense to get it. He never really tried he just came out of the net
edmontonoilers,lxrp5h0,2024-11-18 10:37:43,I
edmontonoilers,lxscian,2024-11-18 12:38:07,Real goalies make the save regardless. Period. Stop defending the goalies for everything. But you are also someone who always does so I have 0 doubt you will change
edmontonoilers,lxt0i8b,2024-11-18 14:38:20,Cool then ill watch
edmontonoilers,lxrngmr,2024-11-18 10:28:29,He's exactly the type of D we need. 
edmontonoilers,lxs0ojm,2024-11-18 11:38:25,Yeah because he’s basically been guaranteeing the other team scores twice every game.
edmontonoilers,lxtnztd,2024-11-18 16:37:12,Broberg holloway foegs and clouder are all injured?
edmontonoilers,lxu2oxd,2024-11-18 17:54:40,yeah? how are special teams and shooting percentage expected goals yadda yadda all doing? Kulak is our 3rd top scorer SV% is abysmal we're in the middle of the league for give-aways...what about this screams cup contender to you? But yeah all is well when 3rd on your team is a 3rd string D man.
edmontonoilers,lxsen33,2024-11-18 12:48:42,Whatever you say bud. Leap to conclusions over a post on the internet more. Its a real good look. Also like how your statement basically says the Oilers are not a winning team with Skinner lol
edmontonoilers,lxsp4b4,2024-11-18 13:41:19,On 880 they said illness maybe he's not used to the WEM Autograph session bugs yet.
edmontonoilers,lxsoclo,2024-11-18 13:37:27,We knew this about Arvidsson coming into the season. He is unfortunately made of glass but he is typically healthy come playoffs
edmontonoilers,lxthpo2,2024-11-18 16:05:34,It definitely was very mixed up and likely will be again starting about half way through the game they did have a Podz - Draisaitl - Skinner line that was rolled out a few times.In any case he's going to get his opportunities with the big boys. If he stays responsible and active defensively he'll earn it.
edmontonoilers,lxsdzq0,2024-11-18 12:45:30,Same is true for Podkolzin on Drai's line. The problem is that it locks J. Skinner into the bottom 6 and he's a terrible fit there.
edmontonoilers,lxst8my,2024-11-18 14:01:51,Maybe he could play defense we could use some bolstering there.
edmontonoilers,lxtds4u,2024-11-18 15:45:52,Draisaitl has been incredible team MVP so far
edmontonoilers,lxt3ykb,2024-11-18 14:55:47,That’s what I was saying fack to. Should’ve been more clear lol
edmontonoilers,lxt9mgt,2024-11-18 15:24:49,whatever excuses you want to consistently make have at er. Bouch's giveaways and at times lack of effort have no excuse. Bouch is evaluated as and considered a 1st line D. yeah skinner should be a back-up but he's not so he needs to step up. he's not the first guy in NHL history to be put in this situation.last playoff's skinner was outplayed by vancouver's 3rd stringer. the year before that he was outplayed by Hill who was a 3rd stringer with no playoff experience who helped them win a cupso I don't accept the constant excuses for skinner because others have proven it can be done.our peak window was last year. either this group wants to win a cup of they don't. because they sure as shit aren't more likely to do it after this year with more cap space tied up.
edmontonoilers,lxtb2g0,2024-11-18 15:32:10,Bouchard ain’t even playing to NHL standards half the time. Dude is supposed to be a 1st pairing D and playing like a first pairing D at this point. He shouldn’t be 2nd pairing at all. He’s supposed to be the guy. Tired of watching someone who’s supposed to be #1 RD but can’t even play a full 60 mins without a catastrophic lazy play.
edmontonoilers,lxs9r3x,2024-11-18 12:24:18,Back to back seasons with 50 GP and an above average SV% but I've seen dozens of comments saying he'll never be more than a back up or isn't an NHLer. Yeah he's having an awful year but he's literally been an above average starter in 2 different seasons lol.
edmontonoilers,lxs8b3i,2024-11-18 12:17:04,Exactly right
edmontonoilers,lxs8wqu,2024-11-18 12:20:06,Its a huge concern.  And we were told we won the offseason...
edmontonoilers,lxs98fv,2024-11-18 12:21:44,Nuge - McDavid - Hyman have a GF% of 61.9. Despite Hyman and Nuge being unable to score. Skinner and McDavid had a GF% of **14.3**. In a small sample size with crazy low PDO but there's only so long you can keep a pairing together when they're getting slaughtered. Draisaitl without Skinner has a GF% of **71**. With Skinner it is 0. In their 51 minutes together they literally didn't score a goal. An amazing xGF% and I hope they get more ice time together eventually but how long can you leave a line together that isn't scoring? And you're not gonna break up the Janmark - Henrique - Brown line for Skinner. He isn't good enough defensively to replace Janmark and that line has been really good. Only breaking even in GF% but an amazing xGF%. A little better PDO and they'd be one of the best 3rd lines in the NHL. Skinner is just in a tough spot right now. I believe there is a good chance he and Drai could pop off playing together but I completely understand why he hasn't gotten another chance yet. It's hard to break up lines that are working even when individuals on the lines aren't scoring.
edmontonoilers,lxsgf37,2024-11-18 12:57:34,Yes as I pointed out in another comment the on ice numbers for the other top 6 pairings are much better. Nuge - McDavid - Hyman have a GF% of 61.9. That's *amazing*. And that's despite Nuge/Hyman's lack of goal scoring. And a bad PDO. Skinner and McDavid had a GF% *below* **15**. That's unbelievably bad. -5 at 5v5 in just ~35 minutes. Draisaitl without Skinner is at 71%. Which is absolutely insane. Unbelievably good. With Skinner it's 0% lmao. Not a single GF in over 50 5v5 minutes. The top 6 is still dominating play and massively outscoring their competition. They weren't doing that when Skinner was in the top 6. Now I've also said that the sample size is small and that his xGF% with Draisaitl was amazing. So I hope they get another chance together. But as a coach how long do you leave together pairings that aren't working? I don't know why I even wasted time writing out a proper response considering your instant insulting but hey here's hoping.
edmontonoilers,lxscwd8,2024-11-18 12:40:03,I didn’t see the news yet.
edmontonoilers,lxrna4w,2024-11-18 10:27:30,No chance but he’ll be back a lot sooner than people in here think.  It was a nasty hit but he also didn’t get knocked out cold or anything.
edmontonoilers,lxrrbr8,2024-11-18 10:49:21,If it was bad concussion he’d be on a plane back to Edmonton.  I think he got extremely lucky.  He got cut bad but his helmet seemed to take a lot of the force.
edmontonoilers,lxry8gj,2024-11-18 11:25:48,Nah. Concussion effects can be delayed. I didn't feel my first concussion until midnight nearly 12 hours after I hit my head.The next morning I was absolutely fucked.No idea how bad Nurse had it but if he had any concussion symptoms then the best bet for his health is to wait 2 weeks minimum.Of course NHL injury decisions are rarely made with the player's long term health as the sole priority.
edmontonoilers,lxs1er0,2024-11-18 11:42:04,Imo chewing him out and reducing his playing time is a good way to send a bad message to the locker room. Coaches need to hold their top players responsible. The leafs game wasn’t the first time Bouchard has handed the other team multiple goals. Bench him for one game (vs mtl would be good) and send a message to your top guys that this shit is unacceptable.
edmontonoilers,lxruxs6,2024-11-18 11:08:31,I mean. That was a terrible mistake he had an entire summer (cough lifetime) to ponder I’m sure he didn’t need to be benched months later.
edmontonoilers,lxsxk97,2024-11-18 14:23:31,I was listening to Devan Dubnyk on got her back after and he made the point of there was no point in bouch gunning it after he fucked up at the other blue line (yes he said bouch fucked up) so when he let up he was getting ready to play the puck should skinner save it which makes sense but looks awful.Again bouch fucked up at the blue line by taking the wrong line and not recognizing that there was danger. 
edmontonoilers,lxspx8u,2024-11-18 13:45:23,[Skinner and Bouch on that play.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg)
edmontonoilers,lxrqnv6,2024-11-18 10:45:49,L
edmontonoilers,lxsm88p,2024-11-18 13:26:50,lol I shit on Skinner when he makes terrible decisions or misses easy savesYou’re not as smart as you think zodiac. You never have been
edmontonoilers,lxskg94,2024-11-18 13:17:56,These real goalies?    League wide save percentage by season:    2024/25 — .901%  2023/24 — .903%  2022/23 — .904%  2021/22 — .907%  2020/21 —.908%  2019/20 — .910%  2018/19 — .910%  2017/18 — .912%  2016/17 — .913%  2015/16 — .915%
edmontonoilers,lxrscxn,2024-11-18 10:54:50,Why? Besides physicality he dosent really do much well he’s very overrated just because he’s a good fighter plays weak competition and still struggles. Not to mention he’s left handed lol
edmontonoilers,lxro063,2024-11-18 10:31:27,Where would he play?
edmontonoilers,lxs4tx9,2024-11-18 11:59:22,With Bouchard on the ice at 5v5 the team is +2. Without him on the ice the team is -4. Yeah he hasn't been as good as he needs to be but scratching him would be an insane decision. Especially with Nurse out. He had an awful last game but is still a positive player. When his on ice SH% starts to bounce back he'll look even better.
edmontonoilers,lxtqx53,2024-11-18 16:52:01,Broberg is hurt. Holloway is back. Mclovin is 28 years old and clouder is doing well in buffalo whatever that means
edmontonoilers,lxsidl9,2024-11-18 13:07:26,Hold on my over emotional friend. You implied you are not watching if Skinner starts?Did you not?
edmontonoilers,lxsozcq,2024-11-18 13:40:38,He has that history.. He travelled with the team and as per Knobs was supposed to play weekend game..  I didn’t see any updates after that..
edmontonoilers,lxsj43p,2024-11-18 13:11:11,11-7 means j skinner will get shift with mcdrai I'm sure
edmontonoilers,lxsitko,2024-11-18 13:09:42,Can Skinner play right wing and play with Draisaitl? Draisaitl has been solid defensively and Podkolzin too - maybe worth the risk?
edmontonoilers,lxss5uh,2024-11-18 13:56:29,The problem is twice posted by Spideyjust above (with numbers) every line he plays on is worse with him on it.
edmontonoilers,lxt65ro,2024-11-18 15:07:00,He ends up playing LD on the PP sometimes honestly he could be great on defense if management could convince him to do that during 5 v 5 without it feeling insulting
edmontonoilers,lxteyfm,2024-11-18 15:51:43,Ah fuck I think he’s gonna get like 4 points tonight then I don’t want it just have a really bad feeling about it
edmontonoilers,lxteosl,2024-11-18 15:50:25,So when is the rest of the team going to be held to the same standard? Last season a lot of the offense was pretty invisible outside McDrai and Hyman. This season it's just McDrai that has been performing. Jeff Skinner is at -7 while playing predominantly on a line with these guys and it's barely even getting mentioned. Im not saying our defense doesn't deserve criticism but tbh you could replace Skinner with an avg. stat goalie and we'd still lose many of these games because the team has been pretty ass throughout.
edmontonoilers,lxtc9x9,2024-11-18 15:38:18,Being annoyed at Bouchard is one thing but thinking he's not even a good defenseman by saying he shouldn't even be top 4 is one of the wilder takes I've read in awhile.
edmontonoilers,lxtbyjf,2024-11-18 15:36:41,if we didn't have Ekholm I'd say we have one of the worst blue lines in the NHL and if he didn't have Ek to back him up I doubt Bouch would be on the first line. He is supposed to be a 2st D pairing after the playoffs analysts were putting him in the top 10 D men. I don't get lazy play I just don't get it. I don't love Skinner but I don't think he's lazy. Bouch is.
edmontonoilers,lxsa8ay,2024-11-18 12:26:42,"Literally.I'm not defending his play recently but I'm also not shitting on him like he's the ""dog shit backup we have"" according to many. He'll be fine just gotta get through this rough patch. He's proved many times he can."
edmontonoilers,lxsb2n8,2024-11-18 12:30:55,I think they'll get there soon they're all too skilled not to. Plus it's good that we're winning games regardless because there's nowhere to go but up on that end. It just feels like the top guys need something to get them going. Drai's been our best player since he was benched for like 2 shifts... yet Nuge and Hyman are plastered to McDavid's side get every opportunity to succeed and yet show less and less by the game.
edmontonoilers,lxse0cg,2024-11-18 12:45:35,The small sample size is the problem though. They gave him like a game or two to figure it out while he was adjusting to a new team and systems and coincidentally everyone else was also struggling. The analytics are great and I agree it will regress but a huge part of why the Oilers are losing games is because these guys have not been able to finish any of their chances. It's a coin toss every game if we're going to score more than two... that's not really a recipe for success either.I'm not saying Skinner is going to come in the line and immediately pop off. I'm saying he's literally of no use on the fourth line and is a perennial 20-goal scorer who needs puck touches and is used to playing with skilled centers instead of playing ten minutes a night with Derek Ryan. I would much rather they figure out his place on the team and what works in November than down the stretch still not know what he is. I don't really agree that the games are must-win right now and it seems like the the team doesn't either because they're playing with almost zero killer instinct.
edmontonoilers,lxsos5u,2024-11-18 13:39:38,Has he really played that much in the Top6? God damn it really hasn't felt like it. Well that is worrying.
edmontonoilers,lxrnk3i,2024-11-18 10:29:01,True.. but I’m not sure if they need to go through a concussion protocol..
edmontonoilers,lxrwftq,2024-11-18 11:16:24,Must be the whip effect like in whiplash but sideways. It’s like getting punched straight on your cheek without seeing it coming. True that if the concussion was really bad he’ll be on the plane back for further testing. But concussion is really tricky.
edmontonoilers,lxs0lad,2024-11-18 11:37:56,If it's really bad I'm not sure they want you at altitude immediately in case there is bleeding/TBI; they'd probably leave him in Toronto with his family for awhile given it's his hometown.
edmontonoilers,lxs3x5x,2024-11-18 11:54:45,You don't have to bench someone for an entire game to send a message like that. Look at what Knob did with Drai like 10ish games ago. Drai took an awful penalty was sat for a couple of shifts and has been a beast since then. In fact he's been playing the best hockey of his career. That sends a huge message (even Draisaitl can be punished) without hurting the team by having a top player miss an entire game. Chewing him out and reducing ice time *does* send the message that this shit is unacceptable. If Bouch gets yelled at and his ice time cut then that can happen to anyone on the team. But you're not gonna scratch your #1 Dman when your #3 is missing the game too.
edmontonoilers,lxrv8po,2024-11-18 11:10:08,He also got passed the cup first in 87... ultimate redemption. Bouch better take notes

edmontonoilers,lxrussx,2024-11-18 11:07:47,Mostly because we're the softest team in the league and he is a really physical shut down D. He's better than Dermont/Stetcher/Brown. Plus Montreal may be more willing to trade than most other teams and the cost might be very reasonable. If Kulak stays on Nurse's pair we could play him with Emberson.
edmontonoilers,lxrv4jr,2024-11-18 11:09:31,But but but he got picked up from Costco has a fun name and gives good interviews!  Thanks goodness Reddit isn’t the GM. We’re benching one of our best D scratching our starting Goalie and picking up fun guys for the team without care for roster management or cap. That’s a guaranteed cup.
edmontonoilers,lxs24a9,2024-11-18 11:45:39,In Edmonton
edmontonoilers,lxsd75e,2024-11-18 12:41:34,You have a lot of nerve coming in here and posting actual facts!
edmontonoilers,lxsyk13,2024-11-18 14:28:30,I mean in the last 10 games he is +1 and -4 in the last 5 so clearly we are trending downwards right now.
edmontonoilers,lxskq1p,2024-11-18 13:19:19,Overly emotional sally doesn't realize this:League wide save percentage by season:    2024/25 — .901%  2023/24 — .903%  2022/23 — .904%  2021/22 — .907%  2020/21 —.908%  2019/20 — .910%  2018/19 — .910%  2017/18 — .912%  2016/17 — .913%  2015/16 — .915%
edmontonoilers,lxsosr0,2024-11-18 13:39:44,I don’t get emotional about sports you’re the one malding over a post on Reddit lol I do have better things to do than watch a hockey game where the team I support is already handicapped at the start by who they start in goal
edmontonoilers,lxtg41b,2024-11-18 15:57:30,IMO they should all be held to the same standard. Stecher Kulak Emberson Philip Pod all really stepped up this year bravo to them. Perry is doing well and I wasn't excited to see us resign him.Ekholm McDrai - godlike beasts as usual. Although Conner is taking a bit to get going he'll be fine.Janmark Brown Pickard - all meet expectationsThe rest of the team has been a pile of dogshit. I didn't expect Hyman to get 50 goals this year. I had high hopes for Jeff Skinner and thought he was a steal....looks like I was wrong. I was excited over Henrique disappointed this year.
edmontonoilers,lxtj3wl,2024-11-18 16:12:34,I said he isn’t playing to that standard right now. Bouchard should be 1RD. But he isn’t playing like a 1RD with how lazy he is. Emberson and Stetcher are playing better defensive hockey than Bouchard is right now. He needs to wake up. He’s had both Keith and Ekholm mentor him and yet he has not stepped up defensively. And people were comparing him to Hughes and Makar last year lol. His offensive skill is incredible. But his lazy play and poor defence is killing this team right now because he is expected to be the guy. Ekholm can’t bail him out forever.
edmontonoilers,lxsk7w1,2024-11-18 13:16:45,Also important context:League wide save percentage by season:    2024/25 — .901%  2023/24 — .903%  2022/23 — .904%  2021/22 — .907%  2020/21 —.908%  2019/20 — .910%  2018/19 — .910%  2017/18 — .912%  2016/17 — .913%  2015/16 — .915%Shooters are getting better across the board. There's very very very few elite tendies.
edmontonoilers,lxsi4dg,2024-11-18 13:06:08,And in those games they were giving him chances they very quickly went 0-3. And a large part of why they were so quickly in trouble was because the top 6 with Skinner wasn't working. Like it was awful. You can not afford to have McDavid sitting at -5 at 5v5. This team goes nowhere fast if McDavid and Draisaitl aren't dominating. I understand the sample size problem and I absolutely hope they get more time together in the future. But as the coach how long do you let it go for? Not a rhetorical question. Your team is 0-3 McDavid and Skinner are -5 at 5v5 after 30 minutes after 50 minutes Draisaitl - Skinner has yet to score a goal. Because I certainly wouldn't let it go much longer while the team is losing. Since the first 3 games the Oilers are 9-4-2. McDavid and Draisaitl have both been dominating play at 5v5. Draisaitl the best hockey of his career. It doesn't make sense to disrupt that by playing Skinner there until the team is in a safe position. Skinner is useless on the 4th line but he was an active detriment in the top 6. He'll get more chances eventually but Knob is trying to win games. Edit: Skinner is actually breaking even when not with McDavid or Draisaitl. 5 GF and GA. With McDavid or Draisaitl he has 1 GF and 7 GA. Him breaking even while in the bottom 6 is actually good and better than I expected. A 4th line that breaks even while the top 6 dominates is great.
edmontonoilers,lxsw66n,2024-11-18 14:16:33,~85 minutes with either or both of McDrai. Oilers had 1 GF and 7 GA in those 85 minutes. Not worrying at all though IMO. He and Drai had a great xGF% and he's been fine playing in the bottom 6 (5GF and 5GA without McDrai). Eventually he'll get another shot with Draisaitl and hopefully they get better luck. But he isn't currently getting outscored in the bottom 6 and the top 6 has been amazing since he was moved down so things are alright for now. Skinner still has 3 5v5 goals which is as many as McDavid lol.
edmontonoilers,lxsxllj,2024-11-18 14:23:42,Well the problem here is as far as we know Knob hasn’t done anything to send a message to Bouchard and his lack of effort has been pretty consistent throughout the entire season. I understand that knobs pretty hand-cuffed now especially with Nurse out so do we reduce Bouchards ice time and basically be half a man down for a game on top of Bouch’s lack of effort. Or do we just bring up a full body to replace him for a night?Imo the latter sounds like a better option. Although your Drai example is a good comparison I don’t think he has the mental that Drai does to receive the message by sitting on the Bench.
edmontonoilers,lxrs5k7,2024-11-18 10:53:44,R
edmontonoilers,lxsm82w,2024-11-18 13:26:48,Yep he's had a bad start. So have a lot of other good goalies.
edmontonoilers,lxs2sax,2024-11-18 11:49:02,I just don’t get how a bottom pairing guy on a bottom 10 team will magically fix our defense. Plus paying the Montreal price to get him. Him and Nurse would be a disaster plus we’d need record PK again with how many pims they’d take
edmontonoilers,lxsokof,2024-11-18 13:38:35,Huh all those numbers are over .877
edmontonoilers,lxspkmp,2024-11-18 13:43:37,Then I was right? Thank you.
edmontonoilers,lxttyx9,2024-11-18 17:07:41,I'd even say before McDavid had an epic last week that he would be right there with Bouchard in terms of underperforming.
edmontonoilers,lxsrps0,2024-11-18 13:54:17,"We're seeing a slow return to 80's style hockey with more and more goals being scored. Which is fucking great!But the downside means that we're probably also going to get scored on more.Like you said there's maybe 3 or so truly elite goaltenders in the league. And then maybe 3-7 more who are ""really good"". And then it just kind of falls off from there."
edmontonoilers,lxsqju6,2024-11-18 13:48:32,To my eye McDavid looked a bit sloppy for the first few games of the season (when he played with Skinner) and has looked absolutely dynamite since returning from injury. So not sure it’s all on Skinner that their combined stats in the early season weren’t great.
edmontonoilers,lxss2c8,2024-11-18 13:56:00,The team has implied on multiple occasions that they were playing poorly for the first 3 games because they were still heartbroken about the cup loss. The second biggest reason they were losing games was because of special teams. Skinner has almost zero impact on both of those things. Sure Skinner didn't do much positive and can be a defensive liability but most offensive players are streaky and make high-risk plays. Did the coaching staff expect him to immediately have a positive impact on those lines if so that's pretty shortsighted? He's coming off a completely different system in a team that had different expectations and he's a unique player it was always going to take some time. And now the Oilers have it. As you pointed out they're 9-4-2 in their last 15 and can easily revert to these lines whenever. Why not use games in November against non-divisional teams to understand what the player brings? Especially when the rest of the team is also underperforming.
edmontonoilers,lxsape2,2024-11-18 12:29:06,S
edmontonoilers,lxsyaxw,2024-11-18 14:27:14,Skinner is not a good goalie lmfao what did he feed you?
edmontonoilers,lxstd5x,2024-11-18 14:02:29,You know what's a disaster... Loosing Broberg and having players like Josh Brown/Stetcher/Dermont. Arber X. would be a huge upgrade on any of those guys. We had a gaping hole on defense before he season and that was with Nurse in the line up. Plus we're so damn soft and all those D are soft. Kulak playing amazing is the only thing covering up that giant hole so far. Doesn't help that we lost so many forwards that were fast skating good defensive forwards. Like why the hell is Ardvisson and Jeff skinner playing minutes on the PK? The Oilers cant afford to take a top defensemen from a top team to fill out our bottom pair that doesn't make any sense.
edmontonoilers,lxsyzzp,2024-11-18 14:30:43,Yep. And Skinner has a career .907
edmontonoilers,lxtui4u,2024-11-18 17:10:31,I'd say before that he was the biggest underperformer. felt like he didn't have enough time to get his head in the game after his wedding summer. glad he's enjoying life and should be but he should be the guy roaring out of the gates to lead by digging the fuck in. Before last week Drai was the only one on the team looking like he wants a cup
edmontonoilers,lxtasjb,2024-11-18 15:30:45,Stecher isn’t that bad Dermott doesn’t seem awful. Josh Brown looked BAD we’ll see more with this call up maybe. I’ve kind of felt a disconnect with the team this year. I’ve always been a fan my whole family is Oiler fans but I even took a break during the decade of darkness mostly to watch Marleau and Thornton play. This year just doesn’t meet the expectations we have as fans coming off last year. Lots of turn around on the roster and an old team. I agree losing Broberg sucks but there’s nothing we can do about it now. Based on track record and playoff performance resigning Janmark Henrique and Brown made sense. Perry seemed crazy to resign at the price but he hasn’t played terrible. Losing McLeod sucks he’s done well in Buffalo but we have Savoie who’s a blue chip prospect we’ll see if he comes to fruition. Losing Foegele is whatever Arvidson directly makes up for him. Maybe not points wise so far but having the right shot makes up for it in my opinion. What else are we missing? I get being frustrated but it’s the game of hockey you win some you lose some. Chemistry isn’t built over night it takes time. I’m guaranteeing we add something but Arber Xhekaj is not going to be the savior in this line up I would almost guarantee he would make this lineup worse
edmontonoilers,lxryhox,2024-11-18 11:27:08,Man I just want an update on Darnell. I hope he's gonna be okay.
edmontonoilers,lxstbxo,2024-11-18 14:02:19,Trade rumours heating today. SJ called up Askarov Pens Petterson on the move. Speculators saying could be related to the oil. I’m sure there’s more coming. Also glad to hear Doc is looking good
edmontonoilers,lxrm9bs,2024-11-18 10:21:54,I'm still grumpy about the loss to the Leafs in OT. It's haunting me. I don't know why.
edmontonoilers,lxs6c4l,2024-11-18 12:07:04,Do we know how long Nurse will be out?
edmontonoilers,lxs9imj,2024-11-18 12:23:09,0-1 on Amazon Prime ... LFG
edmontonoilers,lxrzgz8,2024-11-18 11:32:12,Morning skate is just getting started. So should get an update sooner than later
edmontonoilers,lxt7m8a,2024-11-18 15:14:30,Apparently 5-10 days
edmontonoilers,lxthl3h,2024-11-18 16:04:55,Vanecek was injured last game which is why the sharks called up Askarov
edmontonoilers,lxs5fc2,2024-11-18 12:02:24,Cause they had it lost it got it back again and lost it once more. The Oilers managed to lose twice in one game. That hurts.
edmontonoilers,lxs0gkc,2024-11-18 11:37:15,Because it’s the fucking Leafs and fuck the Leafs.
edmontonoilers,lxsk2x1,2024-11-18 13:16:04,5-10 days so at best he’s back next weekend and at worst he is back after American Thanksgiving on the road trip to Utah Colorado and Vegas
edmontonoilers,lxsae2d,2024-11-18 12:27:30,This is it. Plus seeing Marner doing that stupid celly irks me.
edmontonoilers,lxod5wy,2024-11-17 19:09:07,Boys on the bus
edmontonoilers,lxofqdj,2024-11-17 19:23:45,84 85 87 88 and 90. 5 cups in 7 seasons. Even one after the scumbag grifter owner sold Gretzky to LA to bail out a failing meat packing plant that failed anyways.
edmontonoilers,lxok21l,2024-11-17 19:48:48,What's wrong with Boys On The Bus? Or do you just want something with better video quality? Cameras weren't everywhere back then and the guys that did Boys On The Bus were one of the first to do so with the Canadians then the Oilers. Any new documentary about the 80's Oilers would just use video these guys shot.Episode two of Game 7 might be of interest to you. It features the Oilers vs Ron Hextall (and the Flyers). A lot of the footage is from Boys On The Bus and there's some behind the scenes commentary from the film makers. You can find it on Amazon Prime Video.
edmontonoilers,lxome5u,2024-11-17 20:02:52,Boys on the Bus is brilliant. Seeing as the occasion is mentioned here King’s Ransom is an ESPN documentary on the Wayne Gretzky trade. It’s on Disney Plus and pretty sure can be found somewhere on the interwebs
edmontonoilers,lxor46v,2024-11-17 20:31:45,Boys on the bus
edmontonoilers,lxosgu9,2024-11-17 20:40:04,Amazon’s Game 7 series has an episode on the 80s Oilers
edmontonoilers,lxotpvv,2024-11-17 20:47:45,Great book I read twice “The Glory Barons” Think I have my copy still somewhere here
edmontonoilers,lxre9ny,2024-11-18 09:35:40,This documentary was so far ahead of it's time. The insider view just didn’t happen agaaftin sports until Drive to Survive blew the whole concept wide open.Young drunk Gretzky talking about how he doesn't go on the ice under pressure to be the best he goes out there because it's fun and that's his puck and everyone else can get their own puck is priceless.
edmontonoilers,lxol8g4,2024-11-17 19:55:52,I have no idea what Mr. Pocklington did with the money but I'm sure anybody on the Gainer's picket line will tell you he didn't use the money to bail out the plant.
edmontonoilers,lxouwwf,2024-11-17 20:55:04,Insaaaane
edmontonoilers,lxov4rm,2024-11-17 20:56:25,The show is called Game 7? The boys on the bus is fine I just feel they deserve a docu like the recent bulls docu. The Last….something.
edmontonoilers,lxqd7ao,2024-11-18 04:24:45,Too bad not on uk disney+.
edmontonoilers,lxovf0n,2024-11-17 20:58:09,I would love the best quality if that one so I will look on disney for sure thx
edmontonoilers,lxovggl,2024-11-17 20:58:24,
edmontonoilers,lxpgnf5,2024-11-17 23:16:16,I remember. But that was the story. Poor Peter had to do it to save the Oilers from rising costs.
edmontonoilers,lxoxj2w,2024-11-17 21:11:16,Yes it's called Game 7. The Last Dance was possible for the same reasons The Boys On The Bus was. Video footage. You're going to see a lot more of these docs and miniseries but they won't be from the 80s. Cameras and full access was not the norm back then.
edmontonoilers,lxoxgx8,2024-11-17 21:10:54,They had the footage to make that documentary filmed during that season. Can't make a documentary if the content wasn't produced.
edmontonoilers,lxo9jo9,2024-11-17 18:48:03,Leafs fan here.I absolutely expected and hoped he'd get something like 10 games. Not because he's useless on the ice for my team because that kind of hit can literally kill someone some day and punishments need to reflect the degree of danger that players can put others in when trying to eliminate dangerous plays from the game.
edmontonoilers,lxocdy8,2024-11-17 19:04:37,The Dept of Player “Safety” must start every review with: “hey you know what would be really ridiculous? Let’s do it”.
edmontonoilers,lxomwnl,2024-11-17 20:06:00,A mixtape of different angles? Seeing it live was once too many for me.
edmontonoilers,lxpsouo,2024-11-18 00:50:39,It’s just hilarious how punishments don’t really mean anything.Oilers lose one of their top defencemen for an undetermined amount of time with his entire career/life potentially impacted.Leafs lose a goon who doesn’t really impact their team for 5 games.
edmontonoilers,lxogij2,2024-11-17 19:28:02,The fact that the Leafs aren’t playing today and there is no update on the health of Nurse shows this is a joke call. 5 games sends a message for sure but the dopes in DoPS randomly factors in the degree of injury. Sometimes never always probably what? who…break out the magic 8 ball boys… man the NHL is bush league.
edmontonoilers,lxogft0,2024-11-17 19:27:37,DoPS too lazy to conduct a meeting for suspensions more than 5 games.
edmontonoilers,lxoh2mn,2024-11-17 19:31:12,5-10 was the right call.  Do think 5 is on the low end though.  I don’t think Reaves was flying in there thinking I’m going to blind side check this guy in the head but that’s what happened and the league needs to crack down on this type of hit. The onus has to be on the person making the hit. So yeah it’s low side of wha I would like to see. I wasn’t expecting more though
edmontonoilers,lxr45bd,2024-11-18 08:31:06,The worst part is he has had three previous suspensions and has still not learned. You want to be a dept of player safety you need to keep this player off the ice indefinitely.  Send the right message if your instinct is to injure we don’t need you in the game period.
edmontonoilers,lxopqym,2024-11-17 20:23:21,He should have got retired
edmontonoilers,lxtqi2n,2024-11-18 16:49:53,10-Games would have been ideal and 5-games is what he got so it is what it is.
edmontonoilers,lxrcxwb,2024-11-18 09:27:34,Always felt like you should face a minimum suspension but otherwise miss as much time as the other guy does.
edmontonoilers,lxo8nni,2024-11-17 18:42:50,"The league gave him 5He should've gotten 10And Benn should've gotten 2-5 for his boarding on CarloI do not like Nurse as a player and I hate his contract -- but still the league really should hammer it home when a clear-cut text book example of a hit targeting ""only the head"" comes up."
edmontonoilers,lxon0c0,2024-11-17 20:06:37,5 games is enough for reaves.
edmontonoilers,lxpj8fk,2024-11-17 23:34:58,He even hid behind Skinner and the net.Skinner needs to yell something.
edmontonoilers,lxs00dd,2024-11-18 11:34:58,I don't disagree.The way Nurse was angled - off balance and pushing his whole bodyweight into the direction of the hit - there was never any chance to not get rocked in the face. He was in an exceptionally vulnerable position.I honestly think this was one of the most egregious hits in a long time.
edmontonoilers,lxoabwl,2024-11-17 18:52:39,If it makes you feel any better the hit clearly was not intentional and that was proven as Reaves apparently went looking for Nurse to apologize after the game.
edmontonoilers,lxoe5vc,2024-11-17 19:14:53,I think Leafs fans would want the same if someone like Gaggiula would headhunt Rielly unconcious

edmontonoilers,lxodqfs,2024-11-17 19:12:23,"With text-book head-hits they should start with ""what would be wayyyy too much?""And then go a bit under that50 games might have been too much. 20 games would have been very much defensible."
edmontonoilers,lxrlm93,2024-11-18 10:18:20,+ the goon is basically almost retired he might have had about 10 games left in his career anyways
edmontonoilers,lxok8kh,2024-11-17 19:49:53,Yeah and Reaves is just too far from any league office no way they would be able to get a meeting done in Toronto
edmontonoilers,lxrke5o,2024-11-18 10:11:26,I agree to this
edmontonoilers,lxrlszb,2024-11-18 10:19:22,Multiple guys yelled something it can be heard in the full videos. Nurse did not react maybe he didn't hear them
edmontonoilers,lxoblhq,2024-11-17 19:00:03,"Has there ever been a single dirty  hit after which the hitter goes on the media & says that ""yeah I wanted to kill him""?It is par for the course to act all civilized & apolegetic AFTER you've gotten caught & are facing serious punishmentOnly truly moronic sadist psychopaths do not at least act sorry"
edmontonoilers,lxoavhi,2024-11-17 18:55:50,If I punch you in the face and apologize does that make it unintentional? Dude is a “pro” who made a choice to hit Nurse in the head.
edmontonoilers,lxogbq0,2024-11-17 19:27:01,Bullshit he's staring at Nurse the whole way and braces and turns his shiulder at the last second to clearly make contact.
edmontonoilers,lxohtve,2024-11-17 19:35:39,Agreed
edmontonoilers,lxom0f9,2024-11-17 20:00:34,"""Nurse is at fault for skating around the net he really shouldn't be doing that"" That's what you sound like"
edmontonoilers,lxon2i6,2024-11-17 20:06:59,He had like 6 strides to make a decision. Actually he made a decision.  The game is fast yes but these are professional athletes that are supposed to be making snap decisions. They didnt stumble into the NHL.The amount of games doesn't matter. He barely plays as is. I don't know what the fix is for crap like this. Fine the team? Opponent gets to pick a player that isn't allowed to play for 5 games on the offending team? No clue. 
edmontonoilers,lxoq4ln,2024-11-17 20:25:42,"Reaves wound up at the opposite faceoff circle and had a half dozen strides while maintaining his fix on Nurse. He lined up and threw the hit never made initial contact anywhere else but his head. That's 100% intentional. That makes it ""deliberate intent to injure"".Doesn't matter what an opponent is doing headhunting is dangerous and should be dealt with a lot more strictly than what the league enforces now. By your reasoning a player can kick an opponent in the head of he's on the ice because....*he shouldn't have been down*....just a horrid take and you should sit back to think about your opinion before typing next time "
edmontonoilers,lxopumu,2024-11-17 20:24:00,You're saying Nurse should have expected Reaves to jump into the hit? Because that's what it sound like.
edmontonoilers,lxr7rof,2024-11-18 08:54:54,“A nanosecond DECISION to lift shoulder just a little”. Interesting that even in your defence you note that Reeves made the CHOICE to go for an injury
edmontonoilers,lxpab27,2024-11-17 22:32:15,Yeah that's right blame Nurse  
edmontonoilers,lxrmty0,2024-11-18 10:25:03,I think it would be very workable.  Once Nurse gets cleared by an independent medical professional the Oilers have to give x days notice to the Leafs and at that point Reeves can return maybe there's even short progress reports that are issued along the way.  Independent doctors player agents and the player's association can all be sources of checks to keep teams from abusing the system.
edmontonoilers,lxtm8yx,2024-11-18 16:28:21,I see. Thanks.
edmontonoilers,lxod58c,2024-11-17 19:09:00,no but you generally also don't have players going to the other team's locker room to apologize either even after hits worse than this.
edmontonoilers,lxoceb6,2024-11-17 19:04:40,It's much harder to unintentionally punch someone in the face then it is to unintentionally lay a dangerous check on someone playing at the speed these guys play at and I'm sure you agree with that. Hits with no intent go wrong all the time this hit simply does not look intentional (at least to me)
edmontonoilers,lxonzqq,2024-11-17 20:12:38,[deleted]
edmontonoilers,lxosey7,2024-11-17 20:39:44,If you watch Reaves lifted shoulder in the last nano second.  Had he not done that and had Nurse not skated with his head quite so low the contact wouldn’t have been with the head.
edmontonoilers,lxp2vva,2024-11-17 21:44:29,I also suspect that Edm players didn’t think the hit to head was intentional. Just the way they acted after.
edmontonoilers,lxosvae,2024-11-17 20:42:32,No Nurse should have had basic awareness of whats around which could be done by lifting head now and then. For example he could have adjusted his course to follow the boards rather than to cut to the centre or avoid the hit altogether.Does not mean Reaves should avoid multi-game punishment; he broke the rules and injured a vulnerable player.
edmontonoilers,lxr8za7,2024-11-18 09:02:41,Not what I said. He made the choice to lift shoulder.Nurse took an unexpected trajectory. Had he carried on towards the boards the angle would have been different and his shoulder would have been hit.  Nurse turned in towards the centre. Reaves is large and not manoeuvrable.  I think he lifted shoulder as a reaction to unexpected line taken by Nurse. Wrong decision.
edmontonoilers,lxoodtl,2024-11-17 20:15:00,I agree really reaves shouldn't have even been suspended. It's on nurse to avoid a check to the headAnd for the record I think reaves intended to hit him in the head. He made no contact with any other part of nurses body. He lifted his shoulder into nurses chin it was nothing but a head hitActing like its nurses' responsibility to avoid being hit in the head instead of the responsibility of the hitting player not  to aim for someone's head is insane
edmontonoilers,lxossrh,2024-11-17 20:42:05,Reaves lines him up and took a half dozen strides FFS. Just stop embarrassing yourself here. It was 100% intentional. Notice how not a single Leaf player or coaching staff argued the call? Not one. They know it ever analyst knows it ever fan with half a brain or more knows it.
edmontonoilers,lxos1xh,2024-11-17 20:37:30,[deleted]
edmontonoilers,lxotmbb,2024-11-17 20:47:09,Even Bissonette couldn't defend it. That speaks volumes alone.
edmontonoilers,lxou84y,2024-11-17 20:50:53,Note how I am not arguing the call either.  I said that suspending Reaves is the right decision.  Blatantly obvious it was the right call to kick him out of the game. I think its a reading comprehension problem.Taking a dozen steps is not what resulted in an illegal hit.  Contact with the head did.  When I watched the game I expected Nurse to take a slightly different line towards the boards rather than towards Reaves.  That would have resulted in Reaves hitting shoulder. I suspect Reaves expected the same and was not skilled enough to adjust.
edmontonoilers,lxosvtv,2024-11-17 20:42:37,"By saying that any part of its nurses fault you're implying that reaves isn't fully to blame and that's insane.Reaves skated full speed at him hit nothing but his head. Nurse never moved to avoid the hit reaves went right through his head he even lifted his shoulder to hit him in the head. He would have missed him completely if he didn't lift his shoulder.So yeah he was aiming for his head and hit him in the head. Acting like any of this is nurses fault is insane and the exact reason why goons like reaves still have jobs. People constantly saying ""OH it's jot your fault X player shouldn't have had his head down."" It's just an excuse to allow things like this to continueBut the league clearly wants hits like this in the game otherwise they would be harsher on them when they happen. This wasn't an accident it was head hunting"
edmontonoilers,lxovxtn,2024-11-17 21:01:22,I watched his assessment video.....100% that speaks volumes. Reaves got off easy with 5 games for *another* dirty hit suspension
edmontonoilers,lxovwb6,2024-11-17 21:01:06,I don’t think he was aiming at the head. Nurse took a weird line towards Reaves rather than more along the boards.  Obviously it was due to complete unawareness but watching the game I didn’t expect Nurse to cut towards the centre. We don’t know what Reaves was thinking but my guess - he was expecting same as me and that would have lead to shoulder being the first point of contact. Nurse would have been lined up at a different angle rather han having head pointing at Reaves.  And Reaves isn’t skilled enough to adjust at the last moment.It will always be a hazardous game for as long as contact is permitted.  Players should have basic awareness of whats around them. Yes Reaves should be punished and he should be more careful.
edmontonoilers,lxow4tk,2024-11-17 21:02:35,Then we have different options. Imo he was aiming for nurses head
edmontonoilers,lxoxc7q,2024-11-17 21:10:05,If true then Reaves is a complete moron and deserves more but I really don’t think he expected Nurse to go at him heads down and reaves wasn’t mobile enough to adjust.
edmontonoilers,lxnv1es,2024-11-17 17:24:11,He currently leads the AHL in PIMs
edmontonoilers,lxnu1hh,2024-11-17 17:18:43,[Recent highlight of his](https://x.com/condors/status/1858248231924449456?s=61&t=5JgUaEz8L6eYYJatX5d4VQ). Guy he’s ragdolling is 6’3 222lbs.
edmontonoilers,lxo4g2s,2024-11-17 18:18:08,Fuck.  Means nurse is out.  Not shocking but had My fingers crossed
edmontonoilers,lxnzh8q,2024-11-17 17:49:20,Bring him up for the next game against Toronto. If he can't dummy Reaves what is he even signed for?
edmontonoilers,lxnyy6e,2024-11-17 17:46:18,He stinks
edmontonoilers,lxo56ia,2024-11-17 18:22:26,Fuckkkkkkk
edmontonoilers,lxoiq2k,2024-11-17 19:40:54,Oh goody!  Now we get to ice a lineup with half of our defense not being NHL quality players!  This should go really well!!
edmontonoilers,lxp9ind,2024-11-17 22:27:01,Awesome. This guy is mean as hell. Without Vinny here anymore the Oilers could use some sandpaper on the back end.
edmontonoilers,lxo4nbl,2024-11-17 18:19:19,I would rather give Phil Kemp a shot. He's +4 doesn't take penalties plays a stay at home shutdown style and there is at least a small possibility he doesn't suck at the NHL level. But I guess Brown's $1M salary (lol) is just too much to ignore.

edmontonoilers,lxnvren,2024-11-17 17:28:12,Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh
edmontonoilers,lxokdsz,2024-11-17 19:50:45,Who knows? Maybe a physical guy is the key just hope he doesn’t take too many stupid penalties. What do we think the pairings will look like?Ekholm - Bouchard (assuming Bouch doesn’t get reduced ice time)Kulak - StecherBrown/Dermott - Emberson? (I forgot if Brown is left or right)
edmontonoilers,lxpa7wh,2024-11-17 22:31:40,I think I get this move. This team is very soft and seems to be allergic to hits. Injecting some toughness into this team might help if he can stay out of the penalty box.
edmontonoilers,lxpji4g,2024-11-17 23:36:52,I’m going to put this one out here and say the Oilers trade for Borgen in SEA. RHD expiring 2.7m contract mean fucker
edmontonoilers,lxpsng2,2024-11-18 00:50:18,I actually don’t mind this. In fact I’d rather have him on the team than Dermott.
edmontonoilers,lxoa0z1,2024-11-17 18:50:52,Ha!
edmontonoilers,lxp1cyg,2024-11-17 21:35:04,Oh boy
edmontonoilers,lxo1p91,2024-11-17 18:02:03,About time
edmontonoilers,lxnvmcf,2024-11-17 17:27:25,Hopefully he calms down here our PK hasn’t been spectacular this season yet lol
edmontonoilers,lxobwhh,2024-11-17 19:01:49,Ok yea we need this. The oilers have been soft as hell.
edmontonoilers,lxodp29,2024-11-17 19:12:10,Good lord.. He beat the wheels off of him.
edmontonoilers,lxojz1p,2024-11-17 19:48:18,Before last night I didn’t like this signing at all.  After last night happy to see him in the lineup as the 7th D against asshat teams like the leafs.
edmontonoilers,lxp3hpi,2024-11-17 21:48:12,Brown is a mean fucker.  Don’t mind him putting some fear in teams
edmontonoilers,lxo65fd,2024-11-17 18:28:05,There was no world where Nurse wouldn't miss games from that hit. My concern is if there will be whiplash issues on top of the concussion which could be career-altering. If we're lucky he's only out a few weeks but there's a chance it could be much worse.
edmontonoilers,lxoa04k,2024-11-17 18:50:44,Nurse critics about to witness how valuable he is
edmontonoilers,lxokft0,2024-11-17 19:51:05,Why dummy reaves?  Let him take runs against their top6 players.  If he connects properly great if not I guess it’s a 5 game suspension./s not /s.  Screw the leafs for having reaves in the lineup and concussing players who actually deserve to be in an NHL lineup.
edmontonoilers,lxocn4l,2024-11-17 19:06:02,That's our new reality for Dmen callups.  This sub is going to be wishing we had Ceci back real fast
edmontonoilers,lxoygri,2024-11-17 21:17:02,Brown is a team best +5 and is kicking the shit out of people. The Oilers are butter soft especially without nurse. I think the right call was made.
edmontonoilers,lxodzcg,2024-11-17 19:13:49,Legit question as someone who's not super in-the-know with our AHL roster who would you recommend in his place?
edmontonoilers,lxpalv6,2024-11-17 22:34:17,did you just use “le” unironically
edmontonoilers,lxooluw,2024-11-17 20:16:22,I feel like you might have to split up ek and Bouch and have them drive their own pairs. Brown is a RD but he’s been playing LD in bako lately.
edmontonoilers,lxnvqq1,2024-11-17 17:28:05,He’s been in a lot of fights so that’s part of it
edmontonoilers,lxoe1f6,2024-11-17 19:14:09,Wow. That’s the first time in a looong time I’ve seen a hockey fight where I’ve said “Jesus Christ” to one guy’s punches
edmontonoilers,lxrclom,2024-11-18 09:25:29,If he plays tonight I guarantee him and Xhekaj dance .
edmontonoilers,lxocdk8,2024-11-17 19:04:33,Had he been back in the lineup next game I would have been screaming at the Oiler medical staff like I was Sheldon Souray.
edmontonoilers,lxo8snb,2024-11-17 18:43:39,For sure out for concussion protocols hopefully thats it and no major neck injuries
edmontonoilers,lxolnzh,2024-11-17 19:58:29,I mean I definitely agree. I was just wishful lol
edmontonoilers,lxrdora,2024-11-18 09:32:07,I would assume that after the Crosby injury soft tissue neck injuries are something that teams routinely look for and treat promptly now? Most people don't treat whiplash aggressively because they can't afford it/don't realize right away how severe it is. At least with competent medical staff (I don't think some teams have that but the Oilers certainly do). Then again whatever happened with Yamamoto never seemed to get sorted out.
edmontonoilers,lxolpvh,2024-11-17 19:58:47,100%
edmontonoilers,lxokke3,2024-11-17 19:51:51,Can't argue with that logic. What a dirty fuckin play that was. He's such a bum
edmontonoilers,lxtiz2y,2024-11-18 16:11:55,That’s like having cancer and wishing you also had aids
edmontonoilers,lxp2zdh,2024-11-17 21:45:05,He’s also leading the league in penalty minutes which should pair nicely with our tied-for-last penalty kill this year.I really don’t care if we’re soft--the much bigger problem is that our defense fucking sucks. You need to be good before you can worry about being tough. Josh Brown has thoroughly proven he’s bad at defense so let’s give someone new a try.
edmontonoilers,lxp15vj,2024-11-17 21:33:51,No offense to yegkiko up there but I'm doubting their actual knowledge of Brown. He had a shit camp but he's easily as good as Vinny and actually plays tough and fights.
edmontonoilers,lxopeax,2024-11-17 20:21:13,I don’t hate trying ekholm-stetch and kulak-bouch. Can’t see them risking having Bouchard without ekholm’s cover though
edmontonoilers,lxo3gzt,2024-11-17 18:12:21,So the concept of a plan is to get him to fight and we get back on a winning streak?
edmontonoilers,lxo7urq,2024-11-17 18:38:12,Are we still undefeated with fights?
edmontonoilers,lxojs8r,2024-11-17 19:47:12,Podkolzin dropping Lauzon with a straight right hand didn't do anything for you?
edmontonoilers,lxodiov,2024-11-17 19:11:06,The oilers medical staff has dealt with their share of concussions in recent years. Particularly with Yamo who also had some neck issues as well. Holloway also got concussed in his rookie season a couple years ago. I’m sure they are monitoring nurse closely
edmontonoilers,lxp44jv,2024-11-17 21:52:07,Looks like he has three minor penalties in 12 games. The rest are fighting majors / misconduct.He's not very good but the hyperbole in this thread is strong.
edmontonoilers,lxoq3b0,2024-11-17 20:25:29,Bouch doesn’t need ekholm. He’s perfectly capable without him and if he wants to be paid he needs to prove that he can play without him and drive his own pair. Who knows maybe separating him from ekholm will be the kick in the pants he needs to get going and get out of this slump. You could try this: Bouch - KulakEkholm - Emberson Brown - Stecher I feel like Emberson needs someone more reliable than Brown. Plus him and ekholm have been PK-ing together so there’s familiarity there.I also think that they were getting shifts with other guys after nurse went down. While also getting some shifts together still
edmontonoilers,lxocn1j,2024-11-17 19:06:01,We’re undefeated in games we’ve had a fight inJosh Brown is the key
edmontonoilers,lxo7z3f,2024-11-17 18:38:53,I believe so. It’s been a while since we’ve had a fight
edmontonoilers,lxovdvj,2024-11-17 20:57:57,I felt a tingle.  We definitely need some team toughness.  Also a goalie coach.
edmontonoilers,lxofsct,2024-11-17 19:24:04,Oh I agree.  My point was that the only way he doesn't miss games after that hit is with incompetent medical staff.  I don't think we have that problem
edmontonoilers,lxoeie0,2024-11-17 19:16:52,He doesn’t miss many games either so it will be interesting to see how we do without our $9 million man.
edmontonoilers,lxoxma4,2024-11-17 21:11:50,For sure a goalie coach
edmontonoilers,lxoen3q,2024-11-17 19:17:35,He usually only misses games when he gets suspended during the playoffs 
edmontonoilers,lxnhppr,2024-11-17 16:11:01,Well deserved no place for head hits in the game.
edmontonoilers,lxni5lq,2024-11-17 16:13:24,The amount of people claiming this hit was “clean” and that it’s Nurse’s fault for “not keeping his head up” is fucking absurd.Like I legitimately can’t tell if this many people are trolling or just straight up fucking stupid.
edmontonoilers,lxnia1a,2024-11-17 16:14:05,And somehow Toronto is better off with this. Should have been make Reaves play for 20 minutes a night. Really send a message
edmontonoilers,lxnihkj,2024-11-17 16:15:13,With how shitty the DoPS is 5 is a good amount
edmontonoilers,lxnkbv6,2024-11-17 16:25:19,It’s literally a good thing for Toronto to not have this guy in the lineup and not have to go through the effort of telling him he’s not playing.Can we get soem real consequences for these scrub players?  The guy just took out one of our top d men.
edmontonoilers,lxni9xx,2024-11-17 16:14:04,I was expecting 2 games and a stern talking to from Parros so I'm actually pleasantly surprised
edmontonoilers,lxnkfpl,2024-11-17 16:25:55,Have they said how nurse Is doing?
edmontonoilers,lxnh1rt,2024-11-17 16:07:26,The wheel has spoken.
edmontonoilers,lxngvg4,2024-11-17 16:06:28,He was never offered an in person hearing so it was expected to be 5 or less. Most recent suspension for a hit to head was Tanner Jeannot 3 games for his hit on Boeser who has been out indefinitely since the hit. Reaves or the team can appeal the suspension to Bettman if they want to. Leafs only play 4 games the next 2 weeks so they might have time to appeal it.
edmontonoilers,lxnua31,2024-11-17 17:20:01,Wasn't Nurse just announced as a member of the CTE investigation panel the NHLPA is putting together?
edmontonoilers,lxnxyv9,2024-11-17 17:40:41,The suspension should be for as long as the injured player is out for. Nurse out 10 games? Reaves out 10 games.
edmontonoilers,lxnicg8,2024-11-17 16:14:27,Should have been the whole season
edmontonoilers,lxnsrd8,2024-11-17 17:11:32,There’s this guy on Tik Tok who pretends to be an Oiler fan but he’s really a leafs fan  yeah he makes Tik toks about hockey and wears an oilers jersey but this morning he was wearing an Leafs jersey and gloating and just happy about the hit on Nurse. I despise fake Oilers fans. I really do. I only cheer for Edmonton Oilers that’s it!
edmontonoilers,lxnw9gl,2024-11-17 17:30:59,Only 5 games?!  That's very disappointing.Should have been at least 10 games.
edmontonoilers,lxnt3uh,2024-11-17 17:13:27,Don't go on Facebook or Twitter. It is wild to see how much people are defending him/the hit.
edmontonoilers,lxo4ulp,2024-11-17 18:20:31,should have been twice that.
edmontonoilers,lxoiq5v,2024-11-17 19:40:55,Not enough
edmontonoilers,lxnoz74,2024-11-17 16:50:46,A 5 game suspension for Reaves equals out to about 35k in forfeited salary.He's also a dog shit player with no meaningful point production the Leafs are better off with any other player taking his minutes. Reaves' only purpose on the roster is to hit and hurt players.5 games was really all we could hope for but I fail to see much use in this as a punishment or deterrent.
edmontonoilers,lxnkjqa,2024-11-17 16:26:31,How's Nurse doing?
edmontonoilers,lxnxrna,2024-11-17 17:39:31,That hit was brutal. Leafs should have been forced to play him 20 min a game in the top 6 for a full series in the playoffs
edmontonoilers,lxnm9t3,2024-11-17 16:35:58,They’re better off without him on the roster
edmontonoilers,lxnyqno,2024-11-17 17:45:07,I hope Nurse is OK he definitely looked stunned and was taking it slow in his movements.  He did take a quick look at the puck and I suspect he thought he had more time.  5 game suspension seems reasonable but sometimes I wish they would give it more.  It's not like Reaves is any good at actual Hockey and his absence isn't hurting his team.  Send the fucking message.
edmontonoilers,lxo00mn,2024-11-17 17:52:23,He was always going to get five games because that is the maximum under the collective agreement without an in-person hearing.
edmontonoilers,lxomvst,2024-11-17 20:05:51,Reaves is a goon and should be retired
edmontonoilers,lxpsffe,2024-11-18 00:48:17,Sad that the NHL considers a deliberate attempt to injure only worth a 5 game suspension. Disgusting
edmontonoilers,lxngo97,2024-11-17 16:05:24,Complete bullshit.
edmontonoilers,lxnndug,2024-11-17 16:42:02,Good
edmontonoilers,lxnvkhw,2024-11-17 17:27:08,The better punishment is to make them start him for 5 games.
edmontonoilers,lxo3g99,2024-11-17 18:12:14,Any update on Nurse? Maybe it's answered in another thread below.
edmontonoilers,lxnu0j5,2024-11-17 17:18:34,Hey DOPS got something right for once.
edmontonoilers,lxp2uv2,2024-11-17 21:44:19,Excellent news. There was no reason for that hit!
edmontonoilers,lxr4ors,2024-11-18 08:34:43,# too Few!!!
edmontonoilers,lxrbzl1,2024-11-18 09:21:40,What a POS that guy is. Always has been. Goons are no longer a thing - why is this guy even playing anymore?
edmontonoilers,lxre7g2,2024-11-18 09:35:17,Should have been 10
edmontonoilers,lxs2in9,2024-11-18 11:47:41,Well I would do more than 5 games - this guy needs to learn a lesson.
edmontonoilers,lxs3eya,2024-11-18 11:52:12,Does it matter? Reaves is trash. You should be able to pick a player on the team that serves the suspension. He could be out all yeah and no one would notice.
edmontonoilers,lxo7c35,2024-11-17 18:35:10,Should suspensions carry the rule that one of the games is deferred until the next time these teams play? I have always felt it was a little unfair that the victimized team doesn't get any benefit from the suspension.
edmontonoilers,lxnnutn,2024-11-17 16:44:37,The game moves fast. Nurse didn't square up as expected. Reaves is responsible for the hit. It wasn't purposeful. He felt horrible. He's responsible for the hit. They got this one right.
edmontonoilers,lxp1nyx,2024-11-17 21:36:58,If he played for any other team it would’ve been 8 games.not his first time
edmontonoilers,lxnk8q7,2024-11-17 16:24:51,More was deserved tbh
edmontonoilers,lxnp8xw,2024-11-17 16:52:16,More was deserved and I'm sorry for making this about another incident but I'm salty that jeannot's hit only got 3 when it was so much later of a hit than Reaves'. Wheel doing wheel things I guess.
edmontonoilers,lxre48q,2024-11-18 09:34:44,True that..  even in boxing you can’t hit on the head.. I still remember Khaira’s face when he had that concussion few years back.   And people still say if you don’t want to watch physicality go watch other games.. but I don’t see any games where you can legally hit opponents head.. you don’t need to target opponents head to play physical..
edmontonoilers,lxninkx,2024-11-17 16:16:06,I’ve seen it too. Some people just use the “it’s oldschool” excuse like we don’t know now that those “oldschool” players have brain damage and serious health issues at a young age.
edmontonoilers,lxo4w8a,2024-11-17 18:20:46,It’s so frustrating when people say “gotta keep your head up” after these types of hits because the whole point of the old guard telling that to younger players was so the younger players wouldn’t have to experience their friends (or themselves) developing dementia-like symptoms becoming a shell of their former selves and dying early—sometimes by their own hand.And these assholes are out there saying it as a way to justify and encourage more illegal hits that end up ruining lives. They’re just bad people.
edmontonoilers,lxnlk4p,2024-11-17 16:32:01,People just hate the Oilers.
edmontonoilers,lxoe9je,2024-11-17 19:15:29,This was the dirtiest hit if seen in years. Probably at least 6 years and it maybe tops them. Reaves is a big man and he went through nurses head like a train. I was surprised he was able to move after i thought the stretcher was coming out for sure
edmontonoilers,lxnohtr,2024-11-17 16:48:06,I do think nurse needs to do a better job of protecting himself but that kind of hit has no place in hockey anymore.  Those are the types of hits that can end a career.  Head injuries are something everyone needs to take more seriously.
edmontonoilers,lxr98gm,2024-11-18 09:04:18,These “tough” guys that think they “know” the game of hockey should try having a 225lb goon crush them directly in the head and see how “clean” the hit is
edmontonoilers,lxnjhkn,2024-11-17 16:20:43,Always assume the latter
edmontonoilers,lxnr0es,2024-11-17 17:01:52,My friend if you DONT think many people are stupid you haven’t been around many people …
edmontonoilers,lxnt791,2024-11-17 17:14:00,It’s ragebait
edmontonoilers,lxolhj4,2024-11-17 19:57:24,Little of column A little of column B
edmontonoilers,lxnkpfa,2024-11-17 16:27:23,Disgusting hit but also keep your fuckin head up Daryl.
edmontonoilers,lxnp11a,2024-11-17 16:51:03,See I fully say it wasn’t clean but I don’t think it was a head hunt eitherIt was two tall boys colliding. Reaves doesn’t leave his feet to make the hit or bring his shoulder up he catches Nurse in a bad way cause they’re just big
edmontonoilers,lxnpohm,2024-11-17 16:54:35,Whynotboth?.gif
edmontonoilers,lxoauz8,2024-11-17 18:55:45,Stupid or not. Bet you he keeps his head up next time
edmontonoilers,lxnjdiz,2024-11-17 16:20:05,Ha!
edmontonoilers,lxnv07k,2024-11-17 17:24:00,Should be forced to playGoalie till Nurse is back and healthy.
edmontonoilers,lxnjxea,2024-11-17 16:23:07,Dave?
edmontonoilers,lxnt00s,2024-11-17 17:12:52,On the PP and play on the PK.
edmontonoilers,lxnzqon,2024-11-17 17:50:48,No should have been 10+
edmontonoilers,lxnlbrz,2024-11-17 16:30:45,Better solution. Reaves has to play 25+ mins a night the next 5 games
edmontonoilers,lxnrcr4,2024-11-17 17:03:47,What was forcing Toronto for keeping him in the lineup? Can’t they just toss him on waivers or am I missing something?
edmontonoilers,lxouyz1,2024-11-17 20:55:26,The team needs actual consequences not just the player. We've now lost one of our top D for who knows how long. Leafs lost a marginal fourthliner.
edmontonoilers,lxnl1kl,2024-11-17 16:29:12,Haven’t seen an update yet they’re probably waiting for the swelling to go down to see if he broke anything or just a concussion. But Jack said it’s a good sign that Nurse was seen moving around the locker room and joking around with the training staff last night after he left the game.
edmontonoilers,lxnuj3m,2024-11-17 17:21:23,Yep he’s the team’s representative.https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/article/darnell-nurse-to-be-part-of-new-nhlpa-committee-on-cte/
edmontonoilers,lxow0vu,2024-11-17 21:01:54,I agree but that's not even fair compensation in this case. Toronto doesn't give a shit if Reaves even comes back this season. He's a useless plug.
edmontonoilers,lxniq6j,2024-11-17 16:16:30,That’s just doing the Leafs a favour to be honest he’s been useless
edmontonoilers,lxny0xj,2024-11-17 17:41:01,Leafs fans..  you know the type!
edmontonoilers,lxowcuj,2024-11-17 21:03:59,Too soon to know much. 
edmontonoilers,lxoqjmv,2024-11-17 20:28:15,In goal...
edmontonoilers,lxq4lzi,2024-11-18 02:48:59,Yeah and how about 5-on-4 all game
edmontonoilers,lxp86pw,2024-11-17 22:18:15,Hey. I like this.
edmontonoilers,lxnpky8,2024-11-17 16:54:04,I agree. I think biz was right when he was talking about how nurse just didn't turn up ice which is what would happen 99.9% of the time in that situation. Reaves obviously got a bit over excited to lay down a big hit since he's pretty much good for nothing and he fucked up by hitting him in the head. Do not think it was intentional but he's definitely completely responsible for the outcome.
edmontonoilers,lxnyiuz,2024-11-17 17:43:53,“Square up as expected” WTF??? Nurse had his head down and the DICK  clearly saw that but still gave Nurse the head shot. I can’t fucking believe that anybody would try to justify that FFS!
edmontonoilers,lxpuda5,2024-11-18 01:06:00,Reeves is getting in Raffi Torres areas. This should have been 20 games based on the hit and his history. But he plays for Toronto now so 
edmontonoilers,lxru90k,2024-11-18 11:04:52,What do you mean in boxing? You definitely get points for hitting the head.
edmontonoilers,lxnk79m,2024-11-17 16:24:37,Old-school as in it was allowed when we didn't fully understand the damage these hits caused.Some people are against change despite it being for the good
edmontonoilers,lxnr3zd,2024-11-17 17:02:25,You should have seen the Leafs radio play by play announcer. He started comparing it to a Wendell Clark hit from 30 years ago and downplaying the whole thing saying it wasn’t that bad. Fucking absurd take and he sounded like a fossil
edmontonoilers,lxoab2p,2024-11-17 18:52:30,You look at the results back then too. Imagine prime Kariya’s career. Like I’d rather watch that than some bruising slow 4th liner that can just take suicide runs at guys when they are unsuspecting.
edmontonoilers,lxpp3xf,2024-11-18 00:19:47,Intentional body checking will be out of hockey soon. The speed is way too fast and the need to make a great play so you get the $$ contract is too great. Gone are the days of respecting Reeves in this case as a fore-checker and just rimming the puck.Fly-byes will be the accepted norm if they aren't already.I feel bad for Reeves. You could tell that was not the outcome he was hoping for but if you run around trying to bury your shoulder into people's chests you have to take the consequences when things go wrong. Hope Nurse is OK. .. the dirtiest hit you've seen in 6 years...was it the Mcdavid hit on Leddy? 5 seems about right in today's game. 6 years ago it was 2.
edmontonoilers,lxo6j9z,2024-11-17 18:30:22,But these hits don’t just end people’s careers they ruin people’s lives and the lives of their loved ones by destroying a (sometimes large) portion of who they are. Contrast the post-career lives of people who suffered for example career-ending shoulder injuries (Klefbom) with those who suffered career-ending head injuries (Pronger) and it’s clear they’re very different.In summary i agree with you.
edmontonoilers,lxns5gz,2024-11-17 17:08:12,Nurse made a mistake this one time. It's not like his head is down all the time. Should have been suspended 20 games.
edmontonoilers,lxnxz7z,2024-11-17 17:40:44,He absolutely brings his shoulder up as he initiates contact.  It was not “two tall boys colliding”.  Go watch the hit again.
edmontonoilers,lxo59ry,2024-11-17 18:22:57,ho does leave his feet though. and he is looking st Nurse the whole way he knows nurs head is down and he leaned on his should er st the last second to make contact with the head.
edmontonoilers,lxnz77p,2024-11-17 17:47:45,I thought you meant play goal for Edmonton and thought “that seems a little harsh. Not sure he deserves to have his mental health and career irrevocably destroyed reducing him to a shell of his former self…”
edmontonoilers,lxnp2il,2024-11-17 16:51:17,Daves not here man
edmontonoilers,lxnsfvu,2024-11-17 17:09:46,Make him pay like 500 k - million.  Make the fine hurt and people won’t do this anymror
edmontonoilers,lxo2eer,2024-11-17 18:06:05,Ya I find it hard to believe that they can’t just healthy scratch him?
edmontonoilers,lxnmwgc,2024-11-17 16:39:23,It's better than him being in an induced coma but I think that's about all a person can take from that.
edmontonoilers,lxnmdqk,2024-11-17 16:36:32,I fractured my pelvis and joked around with the x-ray technician. I also did the pain laugh when I fractured my pelvis. Neither was a sign that things weren't bad... it's just how some of us manage pain.
edmontonoilers,lxnmx3j,2024-11-17 16:39:29,It's better than him being in an induced coma but I think that's about all a person can take from that.
edmontonoilers,lxnpldr,2024-11-17 16:54:08,Yeah there’s not a single Leafs fan who is upset he won’t be playing. They all hate him.
edmontonoilers,lxnyai4,2024-11-17 17:42:33,"""It was a clean hit!"" Shoulder-to-head hit. Or""Nurse's fault for not keeping his head up.""Yeah victim blaming is such a strong argument..."
edmontonoilers,lxozfxn,2024-11-17 21:23:06,Josh Brown getting the call up
edmontonoilers,lxod4vt,2024-11-17 19:08:57,He's 100% responsible. What it really showed me the game is too fast for him. I think the point of the 99% comment is the good NHL player can live those odds. Reaves can't.
edmontonoilers,lxocom4,2024-11-17 19:06:17,I mean. Reaves took a bad line Nurse would have been making the turn up ice and Reaves would have hopefully would have been able to do shoulder on chest. Obviously Reaves saw the head down and was going to be turning up ice he got so excited to hit him. Bad decision by a guy that can't keep up with this league. My guess is if my dumb mind thinks that it's gotta be obvious to people that evaluate the players.
edmontonoilers,lxrxnbc,2024-11-18 11:22:44,I meant back of the head.. sorry for the confusion
edmontonoilers,lxnnh5w,2024-11-17 16:42:32,“Old schoool” because it hurts their feelings too much to know the people who should have stopped that stuff back then and didn’t and told them to “suck it up” were essentially not caring for them. It’s a hard pill to swallow for old heads. So they do the second best thing: repeat the cycle to the next generation so that it is normalized. In addition they shame those who oppose it again to keep it normalized. It’s an example of generational trauma. 
edmontonoilers,lxnruky,2024-11-17 17:06:30,Ya we know what those people are called rhymes with preservatives.
edmontonoilers,lxorsuu,2024-11-17 20:35:57,Sounds like Biz-Nasty on the Hockey Night in Canada intermission discussion last night.
edmontonoilers,lxr57yt,2024-11-18 08:38:16,Did you actually think you had something when you wrote this?
edmontonoilers,lxtv673,2024-11-18 17:14:04,This is ridiculous lol feel bad for Reaves? There's a reason the majority of players don't hit guys like this and he has a track record. It's not difficult to avoitoputting your shoulder through someone's chin.You're thinking mcdavid has had the dirtiest hit in the past  year until now? What planet are you on. He should be gone for 20 games after that hit on nurse
edmontonoilers,lxoclti,2024-11-17 19:05:50,And I’m not saying he does that all the time. I don’t agree that it should have been 20 games though.
edmontonoilers,lxof4ph,2024-11-17 19:20:19,I have numerous times
edmontonoilers,lxocoqt,2024-11-17 19:06:18,He doesn’t? His one foot comes off the ixe
edmontonoilers,lxoz7i2,2024-11-17 21:21:40,[Where’d he leave his feet? From the momentum of the hit?](https://imgur.com/a/MC1qUjG)
edmontonoilers,lxnzv24,2024-11-17 17:51:30,It's ok him and his team will get bounced in the first round again.Toronto is never a threat when it comes to playoff hockey.
edmontonoilers,lxnxfbg,2024-11-17 17:37:33,No it's me Dave. I got the stuff!
edmontonoilers,lxntlp7,2024-11-17 17:16:16,Dave's here
edmontonoilers,lxnu88o,2024-11-17 17:19:44,Considering the guy was just smashed in the head and neck it’s actually something important to point out he was moving around and was around others that’s why Jack mentioned it. Pretty different type of injury from a broken pelvis you don’t go into concussion protocol for that.
edmontonoilers,lxntmt8,2024-11-17 17:16:26,How long did it take your pelvis to heal? My grandmother just fractured hers.
edmontonoilers,lxocwfp,2024-11-17 19:07:35,Exactly some dick trying to justify Reaves nailing Nurse because Nurse didn’t square up. So with that logic when a guys heads down it’s go time for a head shot!
edmontonoilers,lxppohc,2024-11-18 00:24:32,End of the day the it’s seems like a lot  of hockey fans just want to watch a blood sport. Just watch the I care about player safety crowd get quiet when banning fighting is brought up
edmontonoilers,lxoskom,2024-11-17 20:40:43,Even preserves have a best before date.
edmontonoilers,lxpm2od,2024-11-17 23:55:41,Biz is a moron. He also downplayed Jeannot’s hit on Boeser on his podcast. Compared it to Sam Bennett. Said a hit like that is ok in the playoffs but doesn’t fly during the regular season…
edmontonoilers,lxotbzq,2024-11-17 20:45:22,Repeat offender. Deserves more than 5.
edmontonoilers,lxofivu,2024-11-17 19:22:33,I have excellent news for you then it seems your eyesight qualifies you to work as an NHL referee.  Apply today and start living your best life!
edmontonoilers,lxo7qmo,2024-11-17 18:37:32,Yeah their roster seems constructed for the regular season (is this due to how GMs are evaluated?) and just can’t get it done even in the first round. 
edmontonoilers,lxo0gzp,2024-11-17 17:55:01,I was actually pointing out that laughing and joking after a serious injury isn't an indication that things are good. Heck Cogliano played with a fractured neck. The body's response to pain and survival is nothing sort of amazing. It's when the adrenaline wears off that things get ugly.Well the fractured pelvis also came with a concussion... I'd take the concussion over the pelvis fracture any day of the week.
edmontonoilers,lxo2ebj,2024-11-17 18:06:04,Close to 4 months before I felt comfortable resuming impact activities... like running. It was a very slow process resuming my regular activities. More out of mental fear than injury related.I was also in my late 20s so on the younger side. Give Grandma lots of love... it's a tough injury.
edmontonoilers,lxodbnp,2024-11-17 19:10:01,Every time apparently.
edmontonoilers,lxotuwr,2024-11-17 20:48:37,I don’t think he is considered a repeat offender because it’s been more than 18 months since his last suspension.
edmontonoilers,lxouliv,2024-11-17 20:53:07,Should have gone to Specsavers.
edmontonoilers,lxo32av,2024-11-17 18:09:57,Cheers thanks.
edmontonoilers,lxou2f4,2024-11-17 20:49:55,If that's the way DOPS looks at it it's a bullshit technicality.
edmontonoilers,lxrvr0t,2024-11-18 11:12:49,Psh who wants to save Spec
edmontonoilers,lxp1h1w,2024-11-17 21:35:46,It’s the way the CBA dictates it I believe.  The players really are their worst enemy sometimes.
edmontonoilers,lxmy48s,2024-11-17 14:25:59,A bunch of that must be earmarked for mcD
edmontonoilers,lxnttvq,2024-11-17 17:17:31,When you finally get rid of Arizona
edmontonoilers,lxmug76,2024-11-17 14:06:45,Hopefully the oilers spend it all on a franchise goaltender.
edmontonoilers,lxn9ebj,2024-11-17 15:27:14,Wonder how much extra revenue all the jersey ads are generating
edmontonoilers,lxnr71v,2024-11-17 17:02:54,Maybe we can finally get a better goalie
edmontonoilers,lxnzdax,2024-11-17 17:48:42,NHL ticket prices could increase 10 percent for 2025-26 (someguyonthetheinternet)
edmontonoilers,lxo06b4,2024-11-17 17:53:17,That should cover Bouchards next contract
edmontonoilers,lxp1xtc,2024-11-17 21:38:39,Thanks Utah
edmontonoilers,lxpia7s,2024-11-17 23:27:53,Perfect timing for McD resign 
edmontonoilers,lxpkrhm,2024-11-17 23:45:57,Considering that’s when 29’s extension kicks in we’ve already spent $6M of that
edmontonoilers,lxrda1x,2024-11-18 09:29:38,That’s almost one whole Darnell Nurse!
edmontonoilers,lxn9ubl,2024-11-17 15:29:34,Good news for us
edmontonoilers,lxmzm1p,2024-11-17 14:34:03,McDavid already makes 12.5 they only need like 3-4m to sign him. Kane Arvidsson and Herique are all UFA’s that year too. 
edmontonoilers,lxmz4kd,2024-11-17 14:31:28,Prepare to be underwhelmed!
edmontonoilers,lxn1jva,2024-11-17 14:44:37,Yep because those guys show up in free agency all the time.
edmontonoilers,lxodsnk,2024-11-17 19:12:45,We only need league average goaltending to win a cup. I’d rather spend moderate $ on a competent goaltender and invest the big $$ on upgrading our top 4 D.
edmontonoilers,lxnyqe9,2024-11-17 17:45:04,Best we can do is all offense all the time
edmontonoilers,lxnylmw,2024-11-17 17:44:19,the last time a franchise goalie went to FA was Bobrovsky if i remembered correctly and he was not cheap.
edmontonoilers,lxr08d8,2024-11-18 08:03:48,Only 10%? What a treat
edmontonoilers,lxpidqh,2024-11-17 23:28:35,I rather not see him resigned
edmontonoilers,lxpu971,2024-11-18 01:04:58,Thank god the jets are lights out too otherwise they'd be tanking revenue
edmontonoilers,lxn5aiv,2024-11-17 15:05:04,Rico/Kane be 36/35 and can't imagine they'll be re-signed.Hopefully some guys willing to take a discount to play with McDrai.Bouchard will take up a decent chunk of the increase
edmontonoilers,lxn1l7q,2024-11-17 14:44:49,Gonna be some tough decisions
edmontonoilers,lxq0h2g,2024-11-18 02:05:12,I guarantee you the NHLPA wants McDavid to take the actual max in the CBA (20% of cap) not the informal Crosby / Ovechkin percentage of cap rule.
edmontonoilers,lxnavsc,2024-11-17 15:35:16,Absolutely.  It's really easy to just go and grab one of those guys.
edmontonoilers,lxo8c1e,2024-11-17 18:40:59,CoughshesterkincoughI realize this is all but impossible  but maybe he wants to play in a smaller market than NYC
edmontonoilers,lxn7ydd,2024-11-17 15:19:35,If Bouch keeps playing how he has been he’ll hopefully take a big pay-cut.
edmontonoilers,lxnyaaj,2024-11-17 17:42:31,We should be able to find skinner/ardvisson type wingers literally every season we have mcdavid and drai as our top 2 centers you'd think. No more overpaying for wingers.
edmontonoilers,lxq0igj,2024-11-18 02:05:36,Bouchard is playing his way into another bridge or a smaller deal than Nurse
edmontonoilers,lxpiywe,2024-11-17 23:32:58,I think they will be easy decisions by then
edmontonoilers,lxrodoy,2024-11-18 10:33:31,"There is no chance McDavid is the first person to sign a legit max contract. We haven't really even seen anyone come close since the early days of the cap. McDavid seemingly cares about winning and his legacy far too much to do something like that. He needs to leave money on the table both for the team to have a chance at winning and to not tarnish his reputation. McDavid is constantly said to be the most competitive guy in the league. ""No one wants to win more than him"" is often thrown around. That is instantly thrown out if he takes 20% of the cap lmao."
edmontonoilers,lxnb3a6,2024-11-17 15:36:23,Awesome. I can’t wait to have the next Vasi.
edmontonoilers,lxngvqg,2024-11-17 16:06:31,The only positive in his game this season? I remember last year I would be happy he scored but mad because his value was climbing lol
edmontonoilers,lxo30d0,2024-11-17 18:09:38,Bouchard and Skinner this year are saving the Oilers so much money in the future.... just kidding if this keeps up Edmonton will have to go out and find a number one G and top pairing D by the time their contacts are up.
edmontonoilers,lxnc0nn,2024-11-17 15:41:27,I'm excited as well lol.Although this might be negated when all of our rivals go out and grab themselves a draisaitl to drop into the number 1 center slot.
edmontonoilers,lxmp94p,2024-11-17 13:39:50,So who are we giving up for Connor Hellebuyck?  /s
edmontonoilers,lxmrdlx,2024-11-17 13:50:48,What is a realistic goalie replacement option ?
edmontonoilers,lxnjn9t,2024-11-17 16:21:34,At what point do we say hey maybe the goalie coach isnt doing good coaching. How many goaltenders do we go through?
edmontonoilers,lxmvm8i,2024-11-17 14:12:47,If you go per 60 we're actually top in the league by a mile at 8.42.Just for reference - Sutter's King's from 2011 to 2014 widely considered the best defensive team of all time were the top team of that era by a mile with only 8.76 HDCA/60.Difference is Quick was good and Skinner is not so good.
edmontonoilers,lxmrc3q,2024-11-17 13:50:34,It’s not about how many defensive breakdowns it’s about when they happen. To me the Oilers seem like they always fall apart in the last ten minutes of games they’re leading in. That’s when the breakdowns come and they’re too egregious and too frequent to overcome. This is why we’re losing games we should be winning. Goaltending could certainly be better but I think my point still stands
edmontonoilers,lxni8dt,2024-11-17 16:13:50,"We keep seeing it time and time again. The Oilers' goalie either gives up the first shot or just can't make the big saves or just seem to regularly draw the ""that's one he wishes he had back"" line from commentators (Campbell and Skinner to a lesser extent Pickard). Meanwhile in the other crease is a former Oiler goalie that's playing ten times better than they did in an Oilers uniform to the point of ""He doesn't even resemble the goalie that was in Edmonton"" vibe (Stolarz Dubnyk and Broissoit). The thing all of them have in common as goalies is that they all at one point were coached by Dustin Scwhartz. Skinner and Picks still do Campbell is in rehab and the other three all got the opportunity to actually develop into competent goalies elsewhere.Schwartz is antithical to goalie development and the fact that he has a job still after ten years is as disappointing as it is dodgy. Despite the chance to play with McDrai goalies don't seem eager to move to Edmonton. They're not stupid they see what happens when you're stuck dealing with Schwartz."
edmontonoilers,lxmxyxs,2024-11-17 14:25:11,Almost exactly one year ago a bunch of you folks wanted to trade for Elvis Merzļikins...thank God THAT didn't happen.   The Oilers need to use their very limited resources on getting another dman.  At the cap pay scale Pickard and Skinner will be more than fine.
edmontonoilers,lxmlesy,2024-11-17 13:19:40,Don’t worry he had an ELITE playoff run (where he was a .901SV% and lost his job to an AHLer for a stretch). To get this guy to give you even league average goaltending is a monumental task he’ll continue to lose us games until he’s hopefully replaced
edmontonoilers,lxmqb1b,2024-11-17 13:45:11,Now that nurse is out the problem will solve itself right……..right?
edmontonoilers,lxmvjyz,2024-11-17 14:12:27,Blackwood? gibson? Monty? Binner? Sad that there isnt many options
edmontonoilers,lxn191b,2024-11-17 14:42:57,Skinny misses Vinny
edmontonoilers,lxn3o5r,2024-11-17 14:56:12,lol- I guess the blows up the Gazzola’s and Rishaug’s arguments of it’s the defence’s fault and not Skinner’s. The cover this guy gets from the media is unbelievable. Side note- Koskinen had better numbers in front of a worse defence and he got chased out of town
edmontonoilers,lxnq6g4,2024-11-17 16:57:18,Guys let’s give Skinner a break here it’s his first year here coming from Buffalo /s
edmontonoilers,lxoztrb,2024-11-17 21:25:27,Doesn’t mean our defense is any good. We limit chances because we typically have the puck in the offensive zone more often than not which is backed by having the second lowest corsi against and the highest corsi for. When the team is defending you can see we struggle to clear the puck we give up lots of second chances off an initial save as well as missing an assignment that gives a clean shot in the slot. It’s gotten better recently but the damage has already been done and our starting goalies confidence is shot. Im still wondering why we haven’t given Skinner any of the games we have played against bottom 5 offenses to help get him where we need him to be.
edmontonoilers,lxmvy8s,2024-11-17 14:14:32,This is what is wild. Our defense makes mistakes and it always ends in the back of the net. Teams with good goalies make mistakes and the goalie makes the save.
edmontonoilers,lxmvw8m,2024-11-17 14:14:15,I don't know where you're getting That from but money puck has Oilers #25 in high danger shots against.https://moneypuck.com/teams.htm
edmontonoilers,lxmzrwl,2024-11-17 14:34:54,They need to bring back Kris Russell from the wilderness and let him take the crease...he's used to blocking shots with even less padding.
edmontonoilers,lxn35cy,2024-11-17 14:53:19,iT’s tHe TEaMs fAuLt
edmontonoilers,lxn3ien,2024-11-17 14:55:18,Part of the reason i didn’t like the Pickard resigning was that you needed someone that could realistically push skinner out of the starting job and play 7 of the next ten if needed. Not that it’s his fault but Pickard just can’t do that.
edmontonoilers,lxpccbv,2024-11-17 22:46:01,I’m no historian but how is it we acquire goalies and they slide just to bounce back when they’re traded?Maybe it’s not the goalie but the goalie coach?
edmontonoilers,lxmoads,2024-11-17 13:34:53,And 75th in expected goals against. The obvious scouting report on the Oilers this year is that they play terrible collective team defence especially Bouchard and their goalies are below average.And here we are 1/4 of the way through the season with terrible team defense especially Bouchard and horrifically bad goaltending costing them games and people are still all Surpised Pikachu Face.We outshoot the other team give up third period leads and lose by one critical goal. Consistently. There’s a reason.
edmontonoilers,lxn518i,2024-11-17 15:03:44,We don't need a regular merchant goalie /s
edmontonoilers,lxmwo56,2024-11-17 14:18:20,This is the biggest thing a lot of fans here won’t talk about. Our goalie tandem is extremely cheap if it gets upgraded it’s almost certainly going to be at a larger cap hit and cost good assets. There is no easy way for the team to address its goaltending issues at this point and they are likely going to just hope they figure things out as the season continues just like last year.
edmontonoilers,lxn5irg,2024-11-17 15:06:18,Steps that Oilers aren’t willing to take1) Change the goalie coach. Something is broken here. Skinner isn’t reading the game. They let the best goalie coach in the org get poached this year by Florida2) Have a goalie dept like all other NHL teams. Right now it begins and ends with Schwartz3) Use your analytics dept. Find that cheap option who is right in the precipice of blowing up. Every Edmonton goalie that comes through here develops the same problems. Glove overcommitted to one side and can’t recover and body mechanics. Talbot and Smith went to outside goaltending coaching to correct this. Dubnyk on the Got Yer Back podcast had Dubnyk on. Dubnyk was talking about the goals against the Maple Leafs. He mentioned Skinner not anticipating the play on the OT goal and McMann breakaway goal. Kevin Woodley has mentioned Skinner’s anticipation/reading the plays a few times last year- and he did again during the finals. Skinner has said earlier this year the game “being too fast”. I don’t know if Skinner has the hockey IQ to be a “good” goalie. I think he is a below average starter that you hope can save most of the routine saves because he is piss poor on high danger chances.
edmontonoilers,lxn9mha,2024-11-17 15:28:24,Maybe MacKenzie Blackwood from the Sharks? He's got a .914 sv% and 5.0 GSAx through 11 games and he's only making 2.35 million this season. With Askarov's .939 in the AHL I'd think Grier would be open to trading Vanecek or Blackwood to make room.
edmontonoilers,lxn6dir,2024-11-17 15:11:00,I don't think they're looking for good goaltending at this point. They just hope to outscore their problems. They're just blasting them at the net and that only works if they're getting some of those in.You gotta wonder how many goalies you have to swap out before you talk about the coaching...
edmontonoilers,lxn8f7t,2024-11-17 15:22:01,Not at this point in the season but after his start in the AHL I would t be opposed to giving Olivier Rodrigue a look in December for a game or 2.Send him back down after a sampling see if it wakes up Skinner and maybe try it again in February for a few more games.Yes he struggled in the preseason but the entire team struggled in the preseason and the first month. If he sticks the team saves assets and I’d guess opens the door for a new goaltending coach. I’m starting to think Skinner might be the only reason Schwartz is still here(other than Schwartz being good in the video room)….. I’ve lost count on how many goals have gone under Skinner’s pad when if he just leaves it flat it’s a simple save. He looks like he’s trying to become a Dominik Hasek/Bill Ranford hybrid and it’s fucking hideous……
edmontonoilers,lxnprc9,2024-11-17 16:55:02,Apparently never
edmontonoilers,lxtxo0o,2024-11-18 17:27:26,Fr this what I don’t understand what goalie has DS made better? At some point you are who your record says you are. You can tell me how respected he is by other goalie coaches and goalies all you want. The bottom line is in his time with the organization he’s not made a demonstrable improvement on a single goalie.
edmontonoilers,lxms0e4,2024-11-17 13:54:09,Other teams give up good chances as well. Its just that their goalie saves them so it doesn't register the same in your brain as when it goes in the back of the net.
edmontonoilers,lxn635s,2024-11-17 15:09:25,Timing of breakdowns doesn’t matter. Your goalie needs to make a save at all points in the game. Skinner last night allowed 3 goals on his last 4 shots. 2 of those goals he played horrendously.
edmontonoilers,lxmvhec,2024-11-17 14:12:06,Do goals count double in the third period? Why does it matter then they happen?
edmontonoilers,lxojlc2,2024-11-17 19:46:04,Except Skinner is literally the worst goalie in the league right now. Thats not fine.
edmontonoilers,lxovozz,2024-11-17 20:59:51,It was a miracle we beat Vancouver last year. It was only because they were so poor. The odds of us going on another run like that again with Skinner seems pretty unlikely. This is an old team that needs to win right now. Time to look at plan B.
edmontonoilers,lxoew2q,2024-11-17 19:18:58,Sadly we might end up with a bit more cap space than expected but need 2 Dmen.
edmontonoilers,lxn1kco,2024-11-17 14:44:41,Yeah had Campbell panned out or we used cap space on an actual starter (or even another asset to bolster the D) we probably win the cup.
edmontonoilers,lxmwidx,2024-11-17 14:17:29,I am hoping sooner than later
edmontonoilers,lxn1zw4,2024-11-17 14:47:02,Ill be honest ive been hating on nurse and his contract in the past. However this season it looks like hes been doing so much better. More fast with decisions more confident on the ice more shooting. However if he does go on ltir (the hit looked like his neck got fucked) then it should open up a lot of money for another dman/goalie
edmontonoilers,lxn0vn1,2024-11-17 14:40:54,And even with options what do we have to offer? We already traded our 25 or 26 1st rounder lol
edmontonoilers,lxn2g5v,2024-11-17 14:49:32,Vejmelka Lyon Forsberg there's options but none of them are going to be genuine starters as teams don't usually let them go.
edmontonoilers,lxnld9p,2024-11-17 16:30:59,Those teams don't have Connor McDavid and Leon Draisatl. You can't have the best scoring team in the league and the best goalie as well
edmontonoilers,lxmw1ut,2024-11-17 14:15:04,Natural Stat Trick league standings sort by high danger chances against. Oilers are fifth fewest.
edmontonoilers,lxo1lby,2024-11-17 18:01:26,Imo should've signed Brossoit. He's 1a 1b calibre goalie now (although he turned out to need surgery)I also wanted to target Stolarz he had been a good backup for years on the ducks and then was decent enough for the panthers. Now he's killing it in Toronto
edmontonoilers,lxq2jcq,2024-11-18 02:26:40,Huh?? Kuemper never played for the oilers lolTalbot had the best season of his career here and Dubnyk was no slouch either go back and look at his stats. They gave up on  both those guys way too early.
edmontonoilers,lxmp7d4,2024-11-17 13:39:34,No they don't play terrible collective team defense at all. Thats why we're 5th best in high danger chances against.Reading comprehension is important.The scouting report is shoot the puck at Skinner and there's a 20% chance it'll go in.
edmontonoilers,lxmqi15,2024-11-17 13:46:12,"""terrible team defence especially Bouchard"" is pretty hilarious"
edmontonoilers,lxmuelm,2024-11-17 14:06:31,They don’t play terrible defence though and that’s the point of this post…. Edmonton has given up the fifth **fewest** high danger chances in the league.
edmontonoilers,lxpw30x,2024-11-18 01:22:04,Easy. Trade drai and Bouchard for Brad Marchand.  Trade Marchand for Holloway broberg and McLeod trade those three guys to Calgary and /or Vegas for picks and retain a bunch of salary. Resign Zack kassian and James Neal trade Connor McDavid for bobrovski and tkachuck. Then   Flip those two +nuge for helly. Easy
edmontonoilers,lxn1iwh,2024-11-17 14:44:28,I've been trying to be optimistic about Skinner (both of them but one at a time) he gets better as the defense tightens up but since it seems Buchard forgot how to play hockey this summer I'm starting to think more on replacements as well.What would be wrong with bringing back Cam Talbot?His stats look good and he's 100k cheaper than Skinner. He is not getting any younger but he's said he enjoyed his time in Edmonton and since he left he's been a journeyman maybe he'd like the idea of retiring here. What would it take to get him from Detroit?
edmontonoilers,lxnk9v6,2024-11-17 16:25:01,Yup. I got roasted for defending Skinner in another post but it boiled down to this issue. We can't afford one of the elite goalies but it's pretty obvious Stu can't get the job done either. I think the Oilers are hoping it will be like last year...Stu gets pulled in the playoffs Pickard helps out Stu comes back in and plays better.
edmontonoilers,lxnr5r8,2024-11-17 17:02:42,With us losing broberg and holloway do we even have any good assets to offer outside of a first round pick? There's not much we can trade without taking away from our team except maybe Savoie. And even then depending on how long Nurse is out for we need to save assets for a dman as much as we need a goalie. I agree that our best hope is that the team get its shit together over the next stretch like last year.
edmontonoilers,lxovcf5,2024-11-17 20:57:42,People don't talk about it because it's so obvious. Unfortunately the Jeff Skinner signing looks like a dud. Gotta use his salary to add a goaltender if possible.
edmontonoilers,lxndrk3,2024-11-17 15:50:31,The criteria that satisfies the condition of being an upgrade in terms of numbers is so low that an upgrade is almost certainly not much more expensive and could likely be cheaper.
edmontonoilers,lxo12ug,2024-11-17 17:58:31,Goalies are the cheapest asset to upgrade on in a trade because of their lack of reliability. Even Ullmark a perpetual in the conversation candidate for vezina was only a first.You don't have to give up much for a goalie
edmontonoilers,lxo033h,2024-11-17 17:52:47,I agree with bringing up Rodrigue. I dont know how Skinner will respond though.  Gives Bakersfield a chance to bring up Brochu from Fort Wayne and let him play.
edmontonoilers,lxn1mr1,2024-11-17 14:45:03,Prime example in last few games as well like when George basically passed McDavid in on breakaway which was stopped
edmontonoilers,lxn5b8l,2024-11-17 15:05:11,Yes and no. Other teams give up chances but other teams don't bank the puck off their own guys ass for a turnover right in front in a 2-1 game for kicks. Or literally give up a full on breakaway with 5 minutes left in a tie game. Like yes it happens but it's sooooo rare. And when it happens it's usually a goal. Like most of the time.
edmontonoilers,lxnkudc,2024-11-17 16:28:07,Yes and in general the other teams goalie is better than ours on most nights
edmontonoilers,lxo66gx,2024-11-17 18:28:16,And your goalie needs to trust the guys in front of him. How many times and goals against are because the team in front of him just stopped playing?  The whole team just kinda glides into the zone with zero urgency hangs at the blue line waiting for the guys who retrieve the pucks to retrieve the pucks so they can have a breakout pass and score lots of goals. Problem is management kinda let those guys go.
edmontonoilers,lxmzab7,2024-11-17 14:32:19,Because that’s how we’re losing games while giving up less high danger chances. Making errors at crucial times (like Bouchard a giveaway to Knies)
edmontonoilers,lxooxa0,2024-11-17 20:18:20,Only up to go then
edmontonoilers,lxnakh5,2024-11-17 15:33:34,Coulda woulda shoulda. Yeah if Skinner made just one or two more stops. If our PP would have just scored one more. If Nurse blocked just one more shot.You can play that game all day long.I just want to see the Oilers finish all 60 minutes including the first and last 5 minutes.
edmontonoilers,lxn1z2y,2024-11-17 14:46:55,Ya thats the issue and we would obvs need retention. I would assume teams would ask for Savoie or orielly so depends what bowman prioritizes
edmontonoilers,lxo9isu,2024-11-17 18:47:54,We don't need the best goalie. As you said we have McDavid and Draisaitl. That doesn't change the fact that Skinner is statistically the worst goalie in the league so far this season. We're just asking for average goaltending nothing more (although that would be great if it happened)
edmontonoilers,lxo3p49,2024-11-17 18:13:42,You can at least have league average goaltending which we never do lol
edmontonoilers,lxmyk3z,2024-11-17 14:28:22,Oh FEWEST which is on par with money puck. Which makes it even worse for Skinner. 
edmontonoilers,lxms7lr,2024-11-17 13:55:12,Yeah that’s how words work. Watch the third period of every game they’ve blown a lead in. Or don’t I’m not your mother.
edmontonoilers,lxq712x,2024-11-18 03:15:19,All right so we'll have Janmark centering our first line and wins the game on the 19th round of the shootout in a 1-0 wins feature a shutout from Helly with 19 saves in the shootout.A win is a win
edmontonoilers,lxqz4jn,2024-11-18 07:55:44,Why didn't I think of that?
edmontonoilers,lxn41go,2024-11-17 14:58:15,I don’t think Detroit gives up their only winning goalie without receiving one in return unless they’ve already decided the season is over. I think it’s too hard to speculate until we’re closer to the trade deadline. The buyers and sellers will be much more clear as well as team’s needs. As bad as Stu has been this year I still don’t like the idea of trading such a young goaltender who has shown periods of good/great goaltending. The team also doesn’t have a lot of great assets but should have some cap flexibility so likely the only real option will be an expiring contract that is overpaid.Honestly I feel like the only hope is Skinner figuring it out as the season goes on.
edmontonoilers,lxn5syy,2024-11-17 15:07:51,The OP posted evidence defence isn’t the problem. Bouchard has underlying metrics that align with other premier defencemen in the league.
edmontonoilers,lxo3bpa,2024-11-17 18:11:30,I don’t know if Ullmark is the best example. Boston had 2 elite goalies both in need of an extension and had to settle on one. Ullmark was/is making 5 mil and got a sizeable raise with his extension. 5 mil is a lot of cap space something Edmonton doesn’t have in spades.Not saying it’s impossible for Edmonton to get a goalie upgrade but I have yet to see a realistic suggestion in this sub. People either suggest a different cheap entirely unproven goalie or ask for elite goalies that not only have a sizeable cap hit but would require decent value going the other way.
edmontonoilers,lxn5w3i,2024-11-17 15:08:19,Other good teams make big defensive blunders regularly but their goalie bales them out fairly regularly.
edmontonoilers,lxnfrvr,2024-11-17 16:00:48,Just the other game McDavid was gifted a breakaway from a bad pass (In the 3rd period I believe) and their goalie stopped it and went on to save multiple grade A chances in the 3rd period. Its just that other team's goalies can actually stop timely grade A chances whereas Skinner can't.
edmontonoilers,lxstg6b,2024-11-18 14:02:55,Look he was passing to the streaking open wingers that were (For some reason) making a change while Bouchard had the puck behind the net. When Bouchard was about to pass and then notice them jumping the boards to go off he PUSHED IT…hit Connor and the rest is history. I’m over it. We got a point.   Next game.
edmontonoilers,lxoarbi,2024-11-17 18:55:08,What you are saying is completely and utterly false. The oilers are one of the league leaders in scoring chances and high danger chances given up. These are the facts. The goalie is 57th in the league in save %. This is fact. The goalie is also 42nd in goals saved above expected. Bottom line- the goaltending is failing the defence- not the other way around
edmontonoilers,lxoec5h,2024-11-17 19:15:54,This I agree with but who do we get to fill that role? I really think that it should be Pickard if we can't trade for anyone... But maybe the oilers move a bunch of players before the deadline and spring to get a good goalie it's a possibility
edmontonoilers,lxop7tj,2024-11-17 20:20:06,I've been trying to find some data I saw some months back listing goalie stats broken down in various situations. Skinner was league worst on the rush but decent with defender coverage hence my comment that he might get better with tighter defense.Maybe we need a second set of stats for when Bouchard just literally can't even any more and gives up on plays. I don't know what column of the stat chart to sort by to get a give-a-shit metric though.Anyone would be hard pressed to convince me that Bouchard's level of selective effort is sufficient for a player of his caliber though and has not led to goals against. He plays fine his stats are good until he gives up on a play and then he's not and Skinner is the goalie that has to bail us out and he's not that goalie.As I was trying to suggest my optimism is fading and regardless of defense woes or not a new goaltender solution may need to be found.
edmontonoilers,lxo4kat,2024-11-17 18:18:49,Sure you're not going to get cheap contract and low asking price but my point is that goalie returns in trades are always substantially lower than people expect. Goalies are voodoo is actually pretty true so the returns are never as high as expected.We could probably pick up Blackwood for a first by itself and if his stats get a bit worse then a second and rodrigue or something like that (better timeline for the sharks better pick come draft time from worse goalie both have value).He'd be a rental and probably require a raise next year but imo were spending too little on goaltending.
edmontonoilers,lxn9994,2024-11-17 15:26:29,I know it seems like that but on the whole if a player is given these kind of free chances they score at a pretty high rate. Skinner over time will almost certainly come back to the mean on this as he did last year. Just like other goalies like Saros who had the same thing going on.People live and die by a moneypuck table on a day in November. Things will be completely different 3 months from now and everybody crying today will act like they believed all along.
edmontonoilers,lxnh0ps,2024-11-17 16:07:17,That's anecdotal the data across multiple seasons tells you the reality. Has Skinner stopped breakaways? Has he made huge saves? Yes! But people don't think about those. They erase them from their minds. They also don't remember the many dunks that other goalies let in as well as all the soft goals.
edmontonoilers,lxorfd1,2024-11-17 20:33:39,We can use all the fancy numbers or we can head over to YouTube and watch with our eyes (you can even use your ears too)  video after video. How many goals have been scored this season alone because the players are just not committing? Is there a measurable stat for give a shit level? How many times is Draisaitl gonna give up on the play and the result is a goal? But the numbers say the goalie sucks and he should have had that... yeah and if McDavid gave a shit the shot would have never happened.
edmontonoilers,lxotrok,2024-11-17 20:48:04,So then there is no point in talking about Bouchard is there? You have just proven my point- no matter how much data tells you that you are wrong- you have decided he is bad and you’ll look for your confirmation bias.
edmontonoilers,lxo83kt,2024-11-17 18:39:37,Would the Sharks be willing to give up Blackwood though? He’s young fits their timeline and likely won’t be too expensive when extended. I appreciate an actual realistic suggestion here though.
edmontonoilers,lxothf1,2024-11-17 20:46:19,Hahahaha- what an absurd statement. These aren’t fancy numbers- it’s a count of what is happening on the ice. It is applied to all players. “Give a shit” metric? lol are you one to decide how much effort one is giving? Your logic doesn’t even make sense. Your eyes have biases. Clearly. Numbers don’t care who you like or don’t like. They just give a quantifiable data set of what is happening. You clearly don’t believe in it.
edmontonoilers,lxss1ac,2024-11-18 13:55:51,These people can’t read or understand facts.  When Bouchard is on the ice his STATS Indicate the best offense versus defense in the entire league.  In other words he drives play and it’s great to have him on the ice.  I can handle the odd mistake or lack of judgment.
edmontonoilers,lxt8qhf,2024-11-18 15:20:17,Well put
edmontonoilers,lxmhzm4,2024-11-17 13:01:14,Why do goalies leave the oilers and reach a higher potential? Thats all I need to see. Schwartz is the problem.
edmontonoilers,lxmih53,2024-11-17 13:03:52,Norris is a trophy for defensemen.  And yes Schwartz IS the problem.
edmontonoilers,lxmjo7s,2024-11-17 13:10:22,I doubt anyone here would have the insight to determine what the problem actually is.Having said that goaltending has been bad for a long time and we've had the same goalie coach for 10 years.  We've gone through (7?) head coaches since then. It seems foolish that we would have kept the same goalie coach the whole time.
edmontonoilers,lxmjwct,2024-11-17 13:11:34,our back up goalie is out performing our main goalie…. and our back up has a 0.89 save %. thats embarrassing. and this is coming from someone who really likes stu and think he has good potential as our main goalie. but we cant keep up like this. we need a new goalie coach
edmontonoilers,lxmkh0k,2024-11-17 13:14:42,I refuse to crap on any goalie we have in the system until this team plays better defensively in front of him. Whether it's systems coaching or personal accountability (I'm looking at you Bouchard) something isn't right with this team.
edmontonoilers,lxni9mv,2024-11-17 16:14:01,When skinner played his first few games with the oilers he came out and challenged shooters and was very good at stopping the first shot. His lateral movement was not good and needed work. Since being here full time he sits deeper in the net making him worse at stopping shots and his lateral movement is still terrible. A proper coach shouldn’t have their goalies play so deep and would have worked on stu’s lateral movement. Schwartz is the problem!
edmontonoilers,lxmjx66,2024-11-17 13:11:42,If something has been broke for a dozen or so years whatever you do don't fix it. 
edmontonoilers,lxmn592,2024-11-17 13:28:55,Here's some cold gard facts for younger Oilers fans from a 40 yr old who's been dealing with this for decades.- We haven't had superstar goal tending since 97-98 which is the last year Cujo was with us. Curtis Joseph was absolutely one of the top 5 goalies in the league in his prime. Every other year was lighting in a bottle years like the Roloson cup year or *star* goal tending like a good Dubnyk year or Tommy Salo year where they'd make the all star game and be good but not superstar quality. Look at this list and tell me any year that comes close.https://hockeygoalies.org/bio/nhl/edmonton.html- On the same note we haven't had superstar defense since the 06 cup run year when we got Chris Pronger and the subsequent add ons that held the line extremely well when Pronger wasn't on the ice for *30* mins a night.So superstar defensive play can make star goalies look like superstars (see: Boston Bruins etc) or superstar goalies can drag a team to the cup finals (see: 90s-00s Hasek Roy and Brodeur teams) but when you have neither and are built completely offensively like today or not at all like the decade of darkness of course it's going to put the spotlight on goal tending.The argument I'll listen to all day though is the way the team is built today it's incredibly evident (see last year) that we can win a cup with just slightly above average goal tending and we currently aren't getting that imo.
edmontonoilers,lxmjdhv,2024-11-17 13:08:48,I don’t even understand the skinner complainers. If Bouchard doesn’t throw a pizza into the middle of our zone right to Knies or forget to skate to defend a breakaway then we are talking about a fantastic start from our goalie where he only gave up one goal. Skinner can give you good starts when the team actually defends in front of him. People who expect him to save every high danger chance have unrealistic expectations. The team has far too many breakdowns in fornt of him right now
edmontonoilers,lxmiypa,2024-11-17 13:06:33,Would this hair-splitting make you feel 1% better given that Skinner is literally dead last in the league in expected goals against?It shouldn’t. The guy is cratering from modest career averages to Campbell levels of ineptitude.Annnnd - directly to your point: Skinner’s glaring weaknesses are high glove hand side to side mobility initial positioning and rebound control. All of those are coachable/trainable things and Schwart either doesn’t see them doesn’t think they’re priorities or does not know how to execute actual improvement. It’s a performance based business and Schwartz’s goalies have been fucking terrible for a decade. That’s not opinion. That’s statistical fact. Save% GAA Expected Goals Against. The Oilers have managed to win despite their goaltending not because of it. You won’t like it you don’t need to agree but it’s the facts period.
edmontonoilers,lxmn9t8,2024-11-17 13:29:35,I don't believe we've had consistent goaltending for a single season since drafting. Connor McDavid. I think Kelvin Pickard has been an amazing backup goalie for us and he's done everything we could have hoped and more considering how much money we pay the guy. Skinner has games where he looks like a legitimate starting goaltender. But during other games he makes it look like he has huge fundamental flaws that are not becoming of a goalie you rely on. To win you extend the cup. This year Skinner has not shown us that he's dropped his consistency issues. So why don't we have a new goaltending coach? And why doesn't the TV ever talk about this? I honestly don't get it. The coyotes gave Sean Burke multiple goalies and he was able to magically take their garbage career and turn them into bright shining stars.
edmontonoilers,lxmjw8p,2024-11-17 13:11:33,Sorry I'm not buying into the Schwartz gaslighting good dayedit: just checked of course this is the same guy who was arguing about the exact same thing a week ago this isn't a new opinion. it's somebody who for some reason feels a need to defend Schwartz. he's just got some awful opinions on hockey.
edmontonoilers,lxmkdzm,2024-11-17 13:14:14,Schwartz has to have dirt on someone right? To still have a job with the organization.
edmontonoilers,lxmjm40,2024-11-17 13:10:03,I feel like Edmonton gives Skinner such a big pass because he’s a local Edmonton guy.He’s not a reliable NHL starter.
edmontonoilers,lxmjk6b,2024-11-17 13:09:46,Maybe score a goal on a 5 minute power play versus worrying about the play of a goal tender the team’s defense abandoned
edmontonoilers,lxmly5u,2024-11-17 13:22:33,Why do people constantly act like we the fans have the power to fire the goalie coach or trade/waive Skinner?
edmontonoilers,lxmnsgs,2024-11-17 13:32:16,"I don't buy the ""Schwartz is the problem"" narrative. The goalie coach is only one of many variables behind goalie performance afaik the only reason he gets blame is because he's been there a long time otherwise I don't see how any fan has the info to evaluate him.I think the real issue is team structure/discipline ""good"" goalies tend to play for teams with strong structure. The goalies learn to to anticipate what their teammates will do how the play will develop and where the chances will come from. Then the goalie starts cheating to be really for things like cross-seam passes that shouldn't be available and they start to struggle.I don't think it's a coincidence that massive team turnover the loss of a 2nd pair RHD and general sloppy play has coincided with Skinner and Pickard both struggling after their solid play last year."
edmontonoilers,lxmldkc,2024-11-17 13:19:29,I'm not exactly sure who you are referring to that has gotten significantly better elsewhere. Maybe Stolarz but he was a 3rd stringer during his short stint here forced to be a backup to a failing Koskinen. While Schwartz has to go our biggest problem with goaltending seems to be our pro scouting and development.
edmontonoilers,lxmnq5t,2024-11-17 13:31:55,I think it comes down to team philosophy Like our team now and then the team in the '80s they virtually different teams plays a totally different style but our team now and our teams in the '80s they leave the goaltender out to dry Every other team coaches their team to play in a way to mitigate these huge scoring opportunities. We don't. And then when we are playing right we don't get consistent goaltending it's dumb
edmontonoilers,lxml58n,2024-11-17 13:18:15,"It's because edmonton just isn't a goalie friendly situation.  They basically never have been. I think it was Robin lehner a while back that said when an agent says edmonton the goalies hang up the phone lol. The way the team plays the chances they give up at times the aggressive nature of fanbse and the pressure of always having to be considered a contender because of mcdavid. I don't know what impact Schwartz does or doesn't have on these goalies but I know the guy doesn't tell them NOT to make a big save once in a while lol. Mike Smith did well for his age ""under DS""  so did cam talbot in the 16 17 season.  Frankly I think blaming some goalie coach for skinner not being able to bail his team out ONCE in 3 chances last night is just giving the players a pass."
edmontonoilers,lxmpcfs,2024-11-17 13:40:19,I think it’s also cause we usually dump these goalies before goalies  on average hit their peak which is usually late 20
edmontonoilers,lxn68zs,2024-11-17 15:10:19,Dubnyk is the only one who reached a higher potential and it took Sean Burke basically building him from the ground up to do itTalbot has stayed the same he always has been. Brossoit hasn’t become a 1A or 1B and is still just a backup behind strong defences. Stolarz has looked decent with the Leafs thus far but the sample size is small
edmontonoilers,lxmlcsk,2024-11-17 13:19:22,Who has done that though? Have you actually looked into the stats? He’s been here a decade so how many have left and gone on to be way better?
edmontonoilers,lxmj3j2,2024-11-17 13:07:16,The fact this guy thinks goalies get the Norris is all you really need to know about this take.
edmontonoilers,lxmlf6g,2024-11-17 13:19:43,Oh yeah lol. Brain cramp.
edmontonoilers,lxmly6q,2024-11-17 13:22:33,Well I know he’s highly revered in the goalie community because he’s added stuff to the position that’s used by everyone today. So the average fan probably doesn’t even understand basic goaltending. Maybe that’s why?
edmontonoilers,lxmnwgp,2024-11-17 13:32:51,Yeah true. We’re 5th for expected goals against and we’re 7th for goals against above expected. So those stats line up and we’re pretty much where we’re expected to be at.
edmontonoilers,lxmm0xz,2024-11-17 13:22:58,That’s what I’m asking in this post. Who’s gone on to be way better or have we just had bad goalies?
edmontonoilers,lxmmlew,2024-11-17 13:25:59,I think it’s the goals saved above expected stat. He does tend to let in some he should’ve had and I guess his stats are pretty bad for breakaways and odd man rushes.
edmontonoilers,lxmmbq5,2024-11-17 13:24:33,Ok yeah just avoid the discussion I’m trying to create because you can’t provide anything besides what gets copied and pasted here.
edmontonoilers,lxmn8n3,2024-11-17 13:29:25,He’s highly revered in the goalie community which I think is why he’s stayed. I just think we haven’t had any good goalies. A coach can only do so much. A good example is Jake Allen amazing with the blues and jersey because they play good D but had an .891 and .892 with the Canadians.
edmontonoilers,lxmls45,2024-11-17 13:21:39,I'd say he's an NHL goalie.  Not sure he's the guy on a serious contender......all this realizing how stupid that sounds considering skinner took them within 1 damn win last season lol.  You can't take that away from him.  I just think there's a fair chance he peaked there and that might be asking alot to repeat it
edmontonoilers,lxmmr9v,2024-11-17 13:26:51,Yeah he is pretty damn inconsistent. As far as goalies go he’s still young and he’s had flashes of being solid so it’s tough to say how good he’s is or how good he can be.
edmontonoilers,lxmo3ce,2024-11-17 13:33:52,Yeah I just checked and our expected goals against based on the chances we give up is near the top of the league. So the team does fucking suck at playing D
edmontonoilers,lxmp4uu,2024-11-17 13:39:13,Talbot Stolarz (small sample size) Brossoit Nilsson   Bryzgalov(in his one season with the wild). Out of our main starters Talbot got worse under ~~Schultz~~Schwartz Campbell got worse under Schwartz Skinner is getting worse under Schwartz. Mike Smith got better but brought his own trainer in after his first bad season. Koskinen stayed the same.No goalie has walked onto the Oilers worked under Schwartz and got BETTER. The best you can hope for is they stay the same like Koskinen.
edmontonoilers,lxmnlft,2024-11-17 13:31:14,>because he’s added stuff to the position that’s used by everyone todayLike what?
edmontonoilers,lxmp2jh,2024-11-17 13:38:53,Cam Talbot came to Edmonton had a great first year then got exponentially worse in his second and third years (ie. when DS's coaching started to creep into his game) then left and was great in the next few seasons for the most part (one bad season in Ottawa) and is still playing great this year at 37 years old.Laurent Broissant was horrible as a backup here under DS then went on to put up solid backup numbers in Winnipeg and Vegas.Stolarz has been way better since he left but he only played 6 games here so that's whatever.
edmontonoilers,lxmol3i,2024-11-17 13:36:22,The fact that we've had so many different goalies over the years and not one has had sustained success. Except Smith that one year who was a veteran tells you something does it not? Vancouver and many other teams seem to turn water into wine on every damn goalie. Vancouver isn't exactly a great defensive team but they've produced half a dozen good goalies in the same time we've had 0. Everyone raves about the goalie coach. Have you ever in your life heard someone say: man this swartz guy sure is a great coach? 31 Other teams would never hire him. 
edmontonoilers,lxmol6n,2024-11-17 13:36:23,Both can be true. We haven't had any quality goalies in the last decade except for Talbot who we ran into the ground and then out of town. And all our goalies have run into consistency issues it's time to try a new voice for the goalie coach.
edmontonoilers,lxmqivs,2024-11-17 13:46:20,Fair but he performs exceptionally well once the zone has been established and the opponent is cycling to generate a chance. All this to say that goalies have different strengths and weaknesses. We need to do more to help Skinner off the rush by not giving away high danger chances through poor defensive play. Skinners not elite but he’s not nearly as bad as some in this sub pretend and blaming the goalie is the number one scapegoat strategy in hockey
edmontonoilers,lxmnfdm,2024-11-17 13:30:22,"This is like the 8th year of this ""discussion"" the arguments haven't changed one iota. There is no discussion to be had. We continue to lose due to goals against and have changed everything else end of story.I don't have the power to make you lose your job Dustin if you could ever tell me what it actually is you excel at go for it. But it seems pretty clear to me it's just at keeping a job."
edmontonoilers,lxn17t0,2024-11-17 14:42:45,Did he take them to the game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals or did they get there despite him?
edmontonoilers,lxs44ze,2024-11-18 11:55:51,Xga is literally fifth lowest in the league. High danger chances against we are literally last (as in first at limiting high danger chances.) High danger goals against is 28th. It's 100% a goalie issue.https://www.naturalstattrick.com/teamtable.php?fromseason=20242025&thruseason=20242025&stype=2&sit=all&score=all&rate=n&team=all&loc=B&gpf=410&fd=&td=You need to stop posting confidently wrong things.
edmontonoilers,lxmobfh,2024-11-17 13:35:02,Sometimes our defense looks really good when Evan Bouchard isn't on the ice haha And I don't see nurse making as many bone-headed decisions this year. Maybe he's just looking better because of his defensive partner. I don't know but I feel like I used to complain. Really hard about nurse every other game last year and I don't blame him for a single game this year yet.
edmontonoilers,lxrzb94,2024-11-18 11:31:22,Who the fuck is Schultz
edmontonoilers,lxmqeiy,2024-11-17 13:45:42,Dude you’re copying and pasting the thing I mentioned didn’t happen in my title and post. Mike smith didn’t hire his own goalie coach. But anyways…Talbots stats stayed almost exactly the same after he lefts us wherever he went. Cant really mention Bryz since he was basically done before we got him. Koskinen wasn’t even in the NHL so we can’t say if he got better or worse. He played on the most stacked team in the KhL that had datsyuk and kovalchuck so of course he had success in the KHL.
edmontonoilers,lxmonkq,2024-11-17 13:36:43,Development of the panda/overlap.
edmontonoilers,lxmrryi,2024-11-17 13:52:55,Talbot had a career .912 in Edmonton .913 in Minnesota .913 in LA .919 in Calgary. Then he’s had bad seasons in Ottawa Philly and one bad one in Edmonton. And Brossoit has been up down up down up down wherever he’s gone. He’s had good and bad seasons in Edmonton Vegas and Winnipeg. Idk. I don’t think we can pin this in Schwartz.
edmontonoilers,lxnbru2,2024-11-17 15:40:09,"You don't get there ""despite"" any goalie man. Even the 80s oilers were winning games 7-5 because fuhr would make that last save they needed.  Skinner stole them game 6 vs Dallas granting them the chance to play for the Stanley cup.  He won them that game.  Skinner was also good in the finals.  I'm not going to stand here and call the guy  a vezina candidate but not giving him credit for going all the way to the cup finals is wild to me.   The Oilers didn't get there winning 6-5 either.  There were MANY low scoring victories in the last 2 rounds"
edmontonoilers,lxn9egr,2024-11-17 15:27:15,Bouchard has the 3rd lowest GA/60 on the team (ahead of Ekholm behind Nurse/Stecher) and lowest xGA/60.He has lowest high danger chances against/60 and lowest high danger goals against/60.A lot of hand wringing on Bouchard because he gets the most ice time and makes visible mistakes because that's what is required to play his type of game.
edmontonoilers,lxs14zm,2024-11-18 11:40:43,"Lol sorry ""Schwartz"". Dustin Schwartz and Justin Schultz always ends up messed up in my brain."
edmontonoilers,lxn6gq6,2024-11-17 15:11:29,A: I said trainer. And he absolutely did. https://oilersnation.com/news/will-a-new-partner-help-mike-smithhttps://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3289541/2022/05/02/oilers-mike-smith-playoffs/After hiring his trainer he went from a .902 to a .923 and .915.B: Talbot left the Oilers at 3.36gaa and .893 sv%. Since then he has only had ONE season under .910 and never hit 3 gaa again. You're straight up just lying.C:Bryzgalov was a +.900 goalie his entire career except his last season. He left the Oilers at 3gaa and. 900. His next season was a 2gaa and .911. He left the Oilers and got better the exact thing you asked to be show.D: I never said Koskinen got better. He wasn't on that list.
edmontonoilers,lxmr76b,2024-11-17 13:49:51,The panda post lock was developed by the Flames goalie development coach (Thomas Speer) and first used by Dustin Wolf. Wrong Dustin? Lol
edmontonoilers,lxot64i,2024-11-17 20:44:23,>He has lowest high danger chances against/60 and lowest high danger goals against/60.  That stat is shocking. That just goes to show how amazing he could be if he had respective decision making without the puck.
edmontonoilers,lxs2xna,2024-11-18 11:49:46,"Lmfao this dude is so confidently wrong so many times and has yet to be like ""oh yeah my bad."""
edmontonoilers,lxm3bds,2024-11-17 11:40:03,I would let Jake Paul punch me in the face for 20 million too.
edmontonoilers,lxm1v1h,2024-11-17 11:32:03,Save it for Reaves
edmontonoilers,lxm0fgi,2024-11-17 11:24:14,A fun post to temporarily take your minds off StuBouch
edmontonoilers,lxmdk0m,2024-11-17 12:36:45,Sorry Evander you're not eligible for pension.
edmontonoilers,lxmo077,2024-11-17 13:33:24,Get on the ice and fight brother
edmontonoilers,lxm1rnl,2024-11-17 11:31:32,I love the thought but Kane would get his head caved in unless he took like 6 months off hockey to train exclusively for a boxing match and even then I don't know how much actual boxing experience he has. I said the same thing about the Tyson fight and even won some sucker bets with my co workers who were thinking that OG iron Mike was going to step in that ring rather than a 58 yr old man. Like him or not Jake Paul is a full time boxer and is training as such.
edmontonoilers,lxmm8ww,2024-11-17 13:24:07,Not what you should be focusing on Evander.
edmontonoilers,lxm1ewp,2024-11-17 11:29:36,I can’t stand Paul. But he beats Kane.
edmontonoilers,lxn2v4s,2024-11-17 14:51:47,He probably doesn't know who he is lmao
edmontonoilers,lxna69j,2024-11-17 15:31:23,I’d pay all the money in the world to watch Kane beat the shit out of Paul on ice
edmontonoilers,lxnrl1r,2024-11-17 17:05:03,Well Semenko fought Ali so it's not that crazy.
edmontonoilers,lxnxccg,2024-11-17 17:37:05,At least that matchup would be kind of funny to think about
edmontonoilers,lxq67zb,2024-11-18 03:06:25,He’ll take a dive for 20M like Tyson did
edmontonoilers,lxqm620,2024-11-18 06:02:42,He'd get his ass handed to him.  Boxing is way way more technical than people think.Paul is no world beater but he would humiliate any non boxer athlete in the ring just with sound basics.
edmontonoilers,lxmy3z3,2024-11-17 14:25:57,Sorry but Kane doesn't have the following for Jake to even consider it lol.
edmontonoilers,lxm9p04,2024-11-17 12:15:17,Kane would get his ass kicked
edmontonoilers,lxmxmeb,2024-11-17 14:23:20,Something no one in here has mentioned.He said that in 2020. He hasn't said anything about it since. As is oiler fans know the Kane of the past is different than the one on our roster.
edmontonoilers,lxnw1hd,2024-11-17 17:29:46,Jake wouldn’t do that. He only likes beating up people twice his age these days
edmontonoilers,lxm317f,2024-11-17 11:38:30,Kane chasing that payday. Unfortunately for him Paul is a much bigger star and Kane isn’t even in his orbit. Both are deplorable but this is the honest take.
edmontonoilers,lxmkumo,2024-11-17 13:16:43,"Boxing is such a pile of shit now I don't even know a single name in the sport anymore except some Internet Bro who beat up a psycho muscle grandpa and ex-MMA CTE wasters who wanted extra money because Dana White scammed their ass for years.What a pile of shit industry and it still makes money because violence is the easiest sell outside the idea of making Pay-Per-View Public Live Pornos with celebrities.

edmontonoilers,lxn9ogp,2024-11-17 15:28:41,Yea agreed.  Fuck up reeves next games he’s back against Toronto.
edmontonoilers,lxnh229,2024-11-17 16:07:29,I legitimately think Reaves never plays in the NHL again. Toronto fans don't seem to like him he isn't fighting and he isn't putting up points. Not sure what it's like behind closed doors but why does he need to play again?
edmontonoilers,lxmlxmd,2024-11-17 13:22:28,An amuse-bouche if you will
edmontonoilers,lxmgalh,2024-11-17 12:51:56,Mike Tyson clearly had mobility and even balance issues so that when Paul would not get closer than jab distance for the most part and was always moving around a lot there was nothing Tyson could do to close in on him and cut off his angles even if the will was there to do it. Kane wouldn't be able to box until his current hockey contract expires anyway. I probably wouldn't question his legs his agility his core or his power though with some proper training. I just don't think that Paul would take a retired Canadian hockey player for a fight.
edmontonoilers,lxmh0y0,2024-11-17 12:55:57,"Sure but having the wealth to not need a day job and training really hard at something.... doesn't mean your are or will be good at that thing.  No dog in this race but acting like Paul is a real boxer because he ""trains with top camps""... turns out camps are businesses and they'll take his money all day long..."
edmontonoilers,lxu8iyo,2024-11-18 18:28:04,True but his deal right now is he has not faced a series of seasoned experienced boxers around his own age.  He trains and takes it seriously but until he gets the experience of fighting those actual boxes that's all it is: he's in good shape.
edmontonoilers,lxm2rdt,2024-11-17 11:37:00,See this fight is actually interesting. Kane being a professional hockey player undoubtedly has incredible cardio but does he have enough to last eight two-minute rounds? (I didn’t watch the “fight” so they may have done less but eight seems like a reasonable amount to me). Kane isn’t nearly as old as the paper tigers that Paul “defeated” but at the same time he’s not a pugilist. If you take away the skates what does he look like in a fight?
edmontonoilers,lxmcq65,2024-11-17 12:32:09,If Kane trains as Jake Paul does he can beat him. Maybe if he doesn't there is a high chance  he beats Jake.
edmontonoilers,lxm5pkm,2024-11-17 11:53:12,Bro no he doesn’t lmao
edmontonoilers,lxpta0l,2024-11-18 00:55:58,Not at all

edmontonoilers,lxmrt1z,2024-11-17 13:53:05,This is obviously wrong…if you have all the time and money and will to train really hard at something unless you have mental problems you will absolutely get good at that thing.
edmontonoilers,lxm3fli,2024-11-17 11:40:41,So just because you’re a hockey player that now means you are a professional boxer?? Like gtfo. There’s a reason ppl train YEARS to be one and 90% are still trash This guy
edmontonoilers,lxm64f7,2024-11-17 11:55:27,You think Kane is a better boxer than Anderson Silva or Tyron Woodley? Lol
edmontonoilers,lxnek5l,2024-11-17 15:54:41,Again the date on the tweet is 11/29/20. The other account I can't even find so guessing just as old.
edmontonoilers,lxmiac2,2024-11-17 13:02:51,You can walk down almost any street in North America and ask people who Jake Paul is and they will likely know. You cannot walk down most streets outside of Alberta and ask anyone who Evander Kane is. You will get a blank face. FactsOh and bro - before you try break your brain - he just added 40 mil to that so sorry you are also wrong there
edmontonoilers,lxn65xk,2024-11-17 15:09:51,Bruh McLeod gang raped a woman Get off this planet
edmontonoilers,lxmdged,2024-11-17 12:36:11,Lol
edmontonoilers,lxmok9u,2024-11-17 13:36:15,That's fair
edmontonoilers,lxtsoep,2024-11-18 17:00:57,This reminds me of when I used to train jiu jitsu. I got good enough to beat all my friends who didn’t train never got good enough to beat anyone in my classes 
edmontonoilers,lxq03db,2024-11-18 02:01:19,Yeah he's head and shoulders above almost everyone with a day job and head and shoulder below almost everyone who's day job is boxing. 
edmontonoilers,lxobzfv,2024-11-17 19:02:18,OK build me a rocketship.. go.. land on Jupiter's moon go.
edmontonoilers,lxm634t,2024-11-17 11:55:16,Paul is not a professional boxer. Sure he's trained woth professionals for years but many have pointed out that any clip of him practicing is still very amateur and riddled with rookie mistakes. Kane grew up boxing because his dad was a pro which doesn't make him pro but it gives him more merit than you're giving him.
edmontonoilers,lxm4wci,2024-11-17 11:48:43,"Well I mean the only credentials you need these days to be a ""professional"" boxer is a YouTube following so why not?"
edmontonoilers,lxmcv6l,2024-11-17 12:32:56,That's not even close to what that guy said but OK.
edmontonoilers,lxm7bq6,2024-11-17 12:02:07,Thinking Jake Paul is even a boxer is the first mistake you goobers made. Ever get your 2 neurons firing long enough to wonder why he isn’t fighting any real boxers or guys who aren’t 60?
edmontonoilers,lxm7lcw,2024-11-17 12:03:36,Exactly. Paul isn’t some slouch.  He can Box and has been training for 8 years now.  He’s just not the world Heavy Weight contender that he thinks he is.
edmontonoilers,lxnkagh,2024-11-17 16:25:06,Again Daily Faceoff did an Instagram post 2 days ago about this 2020 tweet and Kane also responded 2 days ago with the comment “Both of his eyes would be shut.”
edmontonoilers,lxoc4v7,2024-11-17 19:03:10,Ya.. cause you always get your full paycheque right?  And he absolutely has no expenses.
edmontonoilers,lxng8w5,2024-11-17 16:03:12,How is that relevant here? What are you on about bruh?
edmontonoilers,lxp9xen,2024-11-17 22:29:42,You seem like you’re really fun at parties
edmontonoilers,lxm7261,2024-11-17 12:00:38,Exactly. This is the point I was going to make. Jake is at the low end of professional boxer Kane is at the high end of non-professional boxer. I think it would be much closer than people think...possibly a coin flip. Getting lessons from your pro dad when you're a kid sinks deep into the mind and body.I watched all of Kane's fights when he came into the NHL...it's obvious he has boxing skills.
edmontonoilers,lxnbclr,2024-11-17 15:37:48,"Jake Paul lost a split decision to Tommy Fury who is a ""real"" boxer and he dropped him in the 8th round of that fight.Look I hate the Paul brothers as much as everyone else but the reality is that he is passed the point of ""YouTuber doing boxing."""
edmontonoilers,lxm6i0i,2024-11-17 11:57:32,Well for one he is only a professional boxer by definition not in true spirit. He takes washed up opponents; the one actual boxer he did fight he lost.He is still training as a boxer with millions behind him in sports psychologists dieticians personal trainers private coaching advice from actual legends; things 99% of the world just do not have access too. He still knocks Kane out round 1.
edmontonoilers,lxm5hot,2024-11-17 11:51:59,Paul is a complete trash of a human being but he trains 24/7 as a boxer and has done so for like what 8 years now so just taking a snapshot like he was a “YouTube star” is fucking so aged. Like yeah he WAS eight years ago made his money and now trains with 100% legit boxing camps.
edmontonoilers,lxmchmd,2024-11-17 12:30:51,Once Ukraine war is over he will offer klitschko brothers a payday
edmontonoilers,lxmzpd2,2024-11-17 14:34:31,Just pointing out I don’t think Kane has any more of an advantage over Jake than these guys… Kane would still be a cherry picked opponent for him imo
edmontonoilers,lxnokiy,2024-11-17 16:48:31,Sorry. Didn't see his comment in it. Just thought it was typical media dragging up something from years ago.
edmontonoilers,lxnm341,2024-11-17 16:34:55,Sorry. Didn't see his comment in it. Just thought it was typical media dragging up something from years ago.
edmontonoilers,lxnr12v,2024-11-17 17:01:58,Kanes is not playing around lol. No one likes this paul fellow
edmontonoilers,lxozcl9,2024-11-17 21:22:32,I’d just rather you quote something that is actually legit
edmontonoilers,lxphnqy,2024-11-17 23:23:26,When he gets invited to one I'm sure he will be.
edmontonoilers,lxmearr,2024-11-17 12:40:54,OP doesn’t know shit about boxing 
edmontonoilers,lxm95wo,2024-11-17 12:12:21,A coin flipLo fucking L
edmontonoilers,lxm8g6s,2024-11-17 12:08:20,That's entirely possible! I'm not saying it would go one way or the other I just see no reason why it wouldn't happen.
edmontonoilers,lxnbkc3,2024-11-17 15:39:00,> the one actual boxer he did fight he lost.He lost a split decision and he dropped Tommy Fury in the 8th round of that fight.
edmontonoilers,lxm776z,2024-11-17 12:01:26,You're right he does train. But I thought the requirements for being considered a legit professional was ya know to fight actual professionals? Until he does so he's a loser with a YouTube channel who beats up old dudes.
edmontonoilers,lxm5sqd,2024-11-17 11:53:41,Bro you’re the last person who should be bringing up IQ
edmontonoilers,lxnspmq,2024-11-17 17:11:15,I wonder if Paul looks at it like a WWE wrestling heel or rage bait type of thing where he actively wants people to dislike him as a way to get views and stay relevant in social media.
edmontonoilers,lxp6928,2024-11-17 22:05:42,cool.
edmontonoilers,lxmbiax,2024-11-17 12:25:22,Jake Paul's boxing record against active boxers is 0-1.  The guy is an entertainer that's it.
edmontonoilers,lxnh76x,2024-11-17 16:08:14,Sounds like cope. Who won again?
edmontonoilers,lxmbwtf,2024-11-17 12:27:38,Agreed he is an entertainer and is a shit boxer but he trains with some of the best camps in the world. There is no way Kane beats him unless Kane shells out millions and a year of his life to actually try.To argue otherwise is honestly delusionalHonestly imaging posing this question to title holders in boxing. First response would be “Who is Evander Kane” and when the response was “a professional hockey player” the laughs would ensue. At least they know who Paul is.
edmontonoilers,lxnhul5,2024-11-17 16:11:45,"It's not a cope when I don't give a shit about the Paul brothers.I'm pointing out that he held his own against a real boxer (one judge having ruled the fight in his favor) so I'm pointing out it's a bit disingenuous to just say ""the one time he fought a real boxer he lost"" when the context of the conversation is whether or not he actually has any boxing prowess.It's a lot different to imply for example he got knocked out in the first 30 seconds of fighting real boxer versus having lost a split decision where one judge thought he did enough to win."
edmontonoilers,lxmci9l,2024-11-17 12:30:57,I can train with Wayne Gretzky but it isn't gonna make me into Wayne Gretzky. Good training doesn't always equate to results. Calling it delusional is delusional Paul hasn't proven shit.
edmontonoilers,lxmca6b,2024-11-17 12:29:42,Knowing Kane's family history I think a 6 month camp and we got ourselves a good fight.
edmontonoilers,lxmczcz,2024-11-17 12:33:33,Ohh shit! I didn’t know you didn’t have to train for years of your life to actually be decent at something. Fuck it I guess I’m McDavid then!!!
edmontonoilers,lxlivpd,2024-11-17 09:41:22,We might be using that cap space for a goalie at the deadline. I love skinner but he has way too many bad games. I feel better with Pickard in net at this point.
edmontonoilers,lxln39d,2024-11-17 10:07:32,I’ve been very disappointed in Skinner this year. I’m worried that any shot on net could be a goal when the oilers need to make crisp perfect plays to score.
edmontonoilers,lxlkeuz,2024-11-17 09:51:09,Blackwood is looking decent despite Sharks' defence in front of him. $2.35m cap hit that expires this summer. Food for thought.
edmontonoilers,lxlx59v,2024-11-17 11:06:02,Reminder that a team in the cap era has never won a cup with a goalie outside of the top 15 in GSAx over a season. Skinner has never been near that in his career. 
edmontonoilers,lxljrbg,2024-11-17 09:47:00,Novel idea that seems to always get shot down but… why don’t we get rid of the current goalie coach?
edmontonoilers,lxlna6v,2024-11-17 10:08:43,When will our media start a conversation about the goalie coach??
edmontonoilers,lxlxsvj,2024-11-17 11:09:40,"Why are there still so many fans huffing copium with the ""It's not his fault its our defence"" rhetoric...He needs to make key saves on difficult chances. It felt like the Oilers out chanced the leafs 3-1 last night. I don't even think the leafs had a single chance between their first goal and the third period. I've said it before and I'll say it again this team would be unstoppable with an elite goalie. Literally unstoppable."
edmontonoilers,lxlpk2i,2024-11-17 10:22:18,Yeah he’s not a starter. And I say this as someone who likes the guy
edmontonoilers,lxlupak,2024-11-17 10:52:07,Fire our goalie coach Holy shit. How do we always have bad goalies for the ten years he's been here.
edmontonoilers,lxltqlz,2024-11-17 10:46:36,I want to see Pickard get more games he has been a far more consistent goalie than Stu. I love Stu but......
edmontonoilers,lxm7ehw,2024-11-17 12:02:34,The fact the oilers have had a never ending change of head and assistant coaches but have kept the goalie coach for over a decade is insane. The guy must have blackmail on Katz or something because our goaltending has been a weak point for as long as I can remember. Goalies seem to consistently get worse when they come here and better after they leave.
edmontonoilers,lxm2gfh,2024-11-17 11:35:19,Once those kids start coming goalies fall apart. Look at Talbot man was great until he had twins
edmontonoilers,lxm0eou,2024-11-17 11:24:07,I love Skinny but either he gets it together to be at LEAST an average goalie or he's gone. Any other goalie and I'm sure he's run outta town 10x over by now.Now I've seen a lot of shit goalies watching the Oilers over the years. Atm Skinner is no better than Koskinen. Hell he looks like Ty fuckin Conklin out there some nights.
edmontonoilers,lxlx2ee,2024-11-17 11:05:35,This is typical regression for a swartz goalie. When you don't really have goalie success for years and years and years... It's best to just keep the same goalie coach JJ says. 
edmontonoilers,lxmxif9,2024-11-17 14:22:44,He's getting killed on rush opportunities.He's so good in the zone but the moment the opponent gets on the rush he crumbles.Sad.
edmontonoilers,lxmy9qn,2024-11-17 14:26:48,It isn’t surprising when his fundamentals are so bad his glove is average he doesn’t do proper butterfly technique reflexes are slow and mentally he doesn’t have the killer instinct. Oh and his puck handling is AHL quality at best.
edmontonoilers,lxlnpwq,2024-11-17 10:11:21,Sample size isnt small anymore.
edmontonoilers,lxlmssf,2024-11-17 10:05:47,[deleted]
edmontonoilers,lxlo80n,2024-11-17 10:14:23,Stu was and is a backup goalie. Not even close to a No.1. Fucking Talbot would be better right now!
edmontonoilers,lxm59r2,2024-11-17 11:50:47,It's okay for a goalie to make a save once in a while. Sweet Jesus Skinner hasn't saved anything he needed to this season.
edmontonoilers,lxn3sz1,2024-11-17 14:56:57,We need a goalie
edmontonoilers,lxm4evx,2024-11-17 11:46:03,Should’ve acquired Jake Allen last year before NJ
edmontonoilers,lxlnocw,2024-11-17 10:11:04,So in other words he's the worst goalie in the NHL
edmontonoilers,lxlsj9x,2024-11-17 10:39:41,I saw a stat last night with .900 goaltending we'd be 17-1.
edmontonoilers,lxmqvbn,2024-11-17 13:48:08,Death taxes and the Oilers having trouble in net
edmontonoilers,lxod4a4,2024-11-17 19:08:50,The angle Skinner took on that OT goal is painful to look at.
edmontonoilers,lxrf2ss,2024-11-18 09:40:32,I have a soft spot for skinner but we need another goalie. asap.
edmontonoilers,lxm1dj6,2024-11-17 11:29:23,No but don't you know he's actually a good goalie and every stat saying he's shit is just wrong???
edmontonoilers,lxm9hcj,2024-11-17 12:14:05,Skinner has been dog meat all year. He sucked last year too people just look back with rose coloured glasses. He got beat clean off the wing on the game winner in gm 7. He should have had that. Never should have ran back with this guy this year. It was a hope and pray type thing. Same thing they’ve been doing since drafting McDavid. Mr. First shot first goal Talbot was the start of this merry go round. Fuck Skinner and his shitty lumbering game in net. He’s lost out there.
edmontonoilers,lxm16rl,2024-11-17 11:28:21,Might have something to do with the goalie coaching?
edmontonoilers,lxmj9w7,2024-11-17 13:08:14,Sens are playing Ullmark and Forsberg a similar number of games and Ullmark makes way more than Forsberg. I don't see why we can't give Picks a few more games during Stu's slump.
edmontonoilers,lxmpngc,2024-11-17 13:41:52,Stats sometimes lie. Unfortunately this one is absolutely true
edmontonoilers,lxmtlrc,2024-11-17 14:02:22,He's been dreadful. Can't make a save when we need one
edmontonoilers,lxn3lf4,2024-11-17 14:55:46,I’d say get Dostal from the ducks
edmontonoilers,lxn9n5j,2024-11-17 15:28:30,Honestly not surprised. Been seeing a lot of weak ass goals this season.
edmontonoilers,lxncxy1,2024-11-17 15:46:16,Why would Bouchard do this?
edmontonoilers,lxniny0,2024-11-17 16:16:09,The numbers support the eye test. The guy isn't a starter. One of the least athletic goalies in the show
edmontonoilers,lxs19u5,2024-11-18 11:41:23,Goalies continue to disappoint what is up with their coach? how does he keep his job?
edmontonoilers,lxmj4ex,2024-11-17 13:07:24,I refuse to believe it's our goalies at this point. 10 years of failure at the position is more likely that the person leading the position is not doing a good job.
edmontonoilers,lxm6foa,2024-11-17 11:57:11,I have always said stu is a bum and not a nhl goalie level. but people back him because he is a local boy and he’s “nice” but that don’t win games he was bailed out many times last year with the teams ability to put the puck into the net.
edmontonoilers,lxmlee6,2024-11-17 13:19:36,That’s weird I never expected anything from him
edmontonoilers,lxn1fl7,2024-11-17 14:43:57,If the Oilers traded for Blackwood I would be so happy.
edmontonoilers,lxodxor,2024-11-17 19:13:33,Ok I’m hearing Mike Smith and his personal Coach are not likely around or available. How about Roloson?
edmontonoilers,lxp04b5,2024-11-17 21:27:17,Can’t believe this dude outplayed otter last playoffs.
edmontonoilers,lxpknnr,2024-11-17 23:45:09,Dead last in the NHL but first in AHL right?...
edmontonoilers,lxpsaoi,2024-11-18 00:47:07,Jack Campbell was put on waivers today just saying..
edmontonoilers,lxltl5j,2024-11-17 10:45:43,yEaH buT StU IsnT ThE ProBlEm itS aLL BoUcHarD
edmontonoilers,lxm5rox,2024-11-17 11:53:31,Somehow this will be Bouchards fault.
edmontonoilers,lxlqjrk,2024-11-17 10:28:08,ITT; bunch of people who don’t know how to read a chart.   Since the goalies have all played different amounts of games the proper column to use is the “goals saved above expected per 60”. There are 8 goalies worse than Skinner.
edmontonoilers,lxmg7h9,2024-11-17 12:51:27,And the Edmonton Oilers are at the bottom of the league with -12 goals scored above expected. It’s a two-way street but I don’t see anyone implying the underperforming skaters aren’t NHL calibre players.
edmontonoilers,lxmknbr,2024-11-17 13:15:36,Fire Schwartz.  I don't give a duck if he's giving bomb head  kick his ass off the team  we've lost just about 3 good goalies because Schwartz can't coach them for shit.
edmontonoilers,lxmq28k,2024-11-17 13:43:55,Good goalies have come through our organization and for some reason they pretty much always do better when they leave… hmmm maybe it’s not just player? Look at someone like Talbot right now dubnyk had some decent years in Minnesota after he left. I could probably keep going if I thought about it a little harder
edmontonoilers,lxmo22a,2024-11-17 13:33:40,"People have to realize that when players ""show"" their first impressions/mistakes... For 99% of players... those mistakes are going to be with them the rest of their careers.Bouchard is never changing. Nurse is never changing. Skinner is never changing.Skinner has bad technique and he's not an acrobatic freak to make up for it. If the D is good in front of him - he holds up... You know what? The rest of the NHL schlubs can do that too who aren't top 5 goalies... He is what he is at this point. A KNOWN QUANTITY in terms of skill and behavior.And Nurse has way too many brain farts... But he's at least pretty serviceable.Bouchard's mistakes are legit little kid caliber. I don't understand where this dudes brain just stopped absorbing Defensive Awareness and Defensive Effort. This dude brings a half cooked game and he's lucky he has Connor and Leon to boost his stats.Throw Bouchard on a middling team and he's trolling even harder. People like Bob Stauffer need to bring their ""old school"" brain back and quit using Kid Gloves on this dude because he makes a breakout pass. Dude last year when they played Toronto [he legit turned away in the corner from Matthews](https://youtu.be/ilQvi_MA1Ms?si=K9vkgqQlN4U54-rI&t=69)... Then did the same shit with MacKinnon a few weeks later lolThis dudes level of dumbo defies the law of non-contradiction.And lets face it - Nugent-Hopkins shooting 3% as the worst player on the team who has scored a goal is out of this world. This dude is an absolute pantywaist on the ice. Everything is deferral support and avoiding ALL parts of hockey that insist on the use of ego or grit. He's trolling the team by being TOO ""supportive"". I really hate his game. I know he's popular but this dude plays like an absolute pussy. He's the dude at pick up basketball who won't ATTACK the basket ever and is *scared* to attack. Just dish it off and let someone else do the work."
edmontonoilers,lxm4mmy,2024-11-17 11:47:14,At what point do the Oilers give Rodrigue a look seems to be putting up decent stats in AHL
edmontonoilers,lxlsy1d,2024-11-17 10:42:03,Ouch.
edmontonoilers,lxlyxus,2024-11-17 11:15:59,Was hoping all we needed this year was a first or second line right hand defenseman but now talking about an elite number one goalie that can take us all the way to the cup finals is a big ask. I hope Stu can push through maybe try a goalie coach change first see if that shakes things up with him but sucks to have to think about a new goalie on top of other needs
edmontonoilers,lxm0h23,2024-11-17 11:24:28,fire the goalie coach why not?
edmontonoilers,lxm35fu,2024-11-17 11:39:09,Shayne Falco knows a thing or two about being in quick sand lol
edmontonoilers,lxm3j4i,2024-11-17 11:41:14,Wild we got to the finals with him
edmontonoilers,lxmb1sm,2024-11-17 12:22:52,Soup was better. Once again it was the defense last year that almost ruined both. Stew's a solid B goalie never an A. He doesn't have the consistency for it.
edmontonoilers,lxmhlvg,2024-11-17 12:59:07,Is that bad
edmontonoilers,lxmsuzg,2024-11-17 13:58:31,“Skinners our number one” “We figured out our goaltending”
edmontonoilers,lxn63ba,2024-11-17 15:09:26,WHY ARE THE OILERS ALWAYS SO BAD AT THE START OF THE YEAR?! 
edmontonoilers,lxng3kl,2024-11-17 16:02:25,Watch him get traded to vancouver and become a vezina goalie 
edmontonoilers,lxo4pz6,2024-11-17 18:19:45,P
edmontonoilers,lxo9x31,2024-11-17 18:50:14,That’s a lot of bad starting goalies on that sheet. Expected Ingram to be better
edmontonoilers,lxoakdq,2024-11-17 18:54:00,And the organization keeps trodding him out there regardless. Hes been a train wreck.
edmontonoilers,lxohemr,2024-11-17 19:33:09,Got em right where we want them
edmontonoilers,lxow6mi,2024-11-17 21:02:54,Oilers defence take a lot of blameBut let’s be real even if we had a solid 4-Dman it would be a struggle lol
edmontonoilers,lxowoo6,2024-11-17 21:06:01,And we are somehow still in a playoff spot. 
edmontonoilers,lxoz69f,2024-11-17 21:21:26,Lets go Pickard
edmontonoilers,lxp3qga,2024-11-17 21:49:42,Between these charity goalies and douchard on the backend it's a miracle we've won any games at all
edmontonoilers,lxp905o,2024-11-17 22:23:38,They should have traded Darnell Nurse for Linus Ullmark.
edmontonoilers,lxpba47,2024-11-17 22:38:51,Is it possible to get a new goalie? I genuinely don’t know. With cap space and all. What can we do? Can we get a new goalie or not? Skinner lets in way too many weak goals. It happens to every goalie but his is every game. We are not winning a Stanley Cup with Skinner in net. If possible we need a new goalie. While we’re at it bench Bouchard. He’s a huge liability.
edmontonoilers,lxqou9f,2024-11-18 06:29:17,It’s that useless twit goaltending coach Dustin Schwartz that is the problem.
edmontonoilers,lxs62dp,2024-11-18 12:05:41,Funny not as many Skinner defenders these days as the numbers tell the story. Unreliable inconsistent. Easy to see. So now we are two key pieces away from being a contender 2nd line D and a goalie.How does the goalie situation work for a cap strapped team with no assets? Hey give us your cheap less shitty goalie and we'll give you are guy and a 2nd or 3rd rounder?Trading block for Oilers should be: Both Skinners. Package them up with a 2nd round pick and pray for the best.We haven't had a good goalie for 20 years. We got Smith on his last leg oh and Talbot is a good goalie just not here. Obviously we know who has to go first. No point on a new goalie with the same dud of a coach.
edmontonoilers,lxtq3jj,2024-11-18 16:47:51,Can't say I am surprised. I have never seen him as a bona fide no. 1 starting goaltender. Even after last year's Playoffs I was not 100 percent sold. It is what it is this is what they have and it doesn't look like their in search of another goaltender.
edmontonoilers,lxmb6g5,2024-11-17 12:23:34,That matches the eye test.  The Oilers should be winning more games with the low amount of chances they are allowing against and the high numbers of chances they are generating. We are getting goalie'd by goalies all over the league. Vets rookies goalies that are struggling. They're all pitching strong performances against Edmonton and on our end there's Stu who is consistently getting outplayed as the 2nd best goalie in the game basically every game. It's just not good enough and he needs to elevate his game.
edmontonoilers,lxnb515,2024-11-17 15:36:39,He probably leads the league in goals allowed when I expected a save too
edmontonoilers,lxlq7g2,2024-11-17 10:26:08,But look at the other 14 “bad goalies”.  Only 2 have a better save %. And 4 have a better GA
edmontonoilers,lxmpol9,2024-11-17 13:42:01,It's that time of year! November. Everyone blame the goaltender! It has nothing to do with our defense because advanced stats models are so perfect Oilers be Goalie career killers.
edmontonoilers,lxme010,2024-11-17 12:39:13,I keep saying he’s terrible only to be down-voted. Just bc it’s a hometown boy doesn’t mean we should keep him.Btw when it’s constantly our goalies who are underperforming you wonder when they would get rid of Dustin but he’s married into the Katz family now so that’s impossible…
edmontonoilers,lxltcly,2024-11-17 10:44:20,He’s a bum. Give Rodrigue and Pickard the crease until you can find a trade
edmontonoilers,lxlj1f4,2024-11-17 09:42:23,Sophomore Blues for our Skinner. He’ll be ok. Pickard playing well behind him will be huge this year.
edmontonoilers,lxmaxyu,2024-11-17 12:22:16,Bouchard has not been his friend.
edmontonoilers,lxmisnw,2024-11-17 13:05:36,Skinner is good because he has big mustache and he from here and he smile big
edmontonoilers,lxmlwal,2024-11-17 13:22:17,Team Canada better chose Talbot skinner and binners are big suck rn
edmontonoilers,lxn7dyz,2024-11-17 15:16:27,Expectations were simply too high (or too low for other goalies).  That’s the problem with this metric.  Expectations can simply be wrong which makes the measurement wrong.
edmontonoilers,lxprucw,2024-11-18 00:43:09,Skinner is very consistent. The problem is he is terrible off the rush and great during zone cycling. Skinners good games are when the team plays tight defensively and has bad games when they don’t. I like Skinner and think he can be a great goalie but they need to figure out how to make him more confident off the rush.
edmontonoilers,lxmp3kx,2024-11-17 13:39:02,He’s also played the most minutes. He’s 61out of 75 when adjusted to  per 60min
edmontonoilers,lxmwo4c,2024-11-17 14:18:20,none of you even know what schwartz looks like or what an nhl goalie coach actually does in their day to day job yet you’re all convinced that this is the head that needs to roll in order to save the season. fact is the oilers haven’t drafted or signed or traded for a legit starter in 10 years that’s gonna be capable of saving games every time the team forgets defence that’s not on schwartz he ain’t rumpelstiltskin spinnin gold out of basket cases like campbell and koskinen literally no one can do that.
edmontonoilers,lxn4pr4,2024-11-17 15:01:58,Stu could be under a lot of pressure this season; expected to bounce back after the SCF and add up the 4 nations. I hope he could clear up his mind with the distractions and start anew.
edmontonoilers,lxnkukj,2024-11-17 16:28:08,Not surprised one bit. Defense regressed significantly from last year and so did Stus play. Obviously he’s dealing with some confidence issues but the team in front isn’t making it any easier. Still not sure why the defense needed an overhaul after being as successful as it was last year
edmontonoilers,lxnkg7t,2024-11-17 16:26:00,I miss soup
edmontonoilers,lxlpebm,2024-11-17 10:21:20,What goalie can we get for Hyman?
edmontonoilers,lxlmopy,2024-11-17 10:05:06,I think Pickard has been more consistent for us lately. he deserves more time in the net. with stu he needs a new coach coupled with a bit of bench time for a stretch of games.
edmontonoilers,lxmbtjj,2024-11-17 12:27:07,Not only do we need a goalie but a goalie coach.I think Dustin Schwartz is the problem as well
edmontonoilers,lxlssia,2024-11-17 10:41:11,Yes sign a goalie.
edmontonoilers,lxma2q2,2024-11-17 12:17:26,I always do even tho he’s good for a spin around stick loss at least once a game I can live with it. His tracking and positioning are much better. He’s just smaller that’s all. He’s a BETTER goalie even tho he’s smaller.
edmontonoilers,lxqiz5s,2024-11-18 05:28:52,But his mustache:(
edmontonoilers,lxrib1i,2024-11-18 09:59:28,McDavid for Shesterkin straight up. (I'm a Rangers fan half trolling I wish we would just sign him already)
edmontonoilers,lxmsz0u,2024-11-17 13:59:07,Considering Stu is supposed to be a backup goalie still...and for the next several years....yes
edmontonoilers,lxmq6wc,2024-11-17 13:44:35,Not giving Markstrom that extra year is looking like a bigger and bigger miss. Proven goalies who aren't already ancient are so hard to come by we better start praying.
edmontonoilers,lxm223r,2024-11-17 11:33:08,Yeah I'm feeling it too. I really thought he was going to come in strong and with a new found confidence after the cup run. I like him and want him to succeed. But this is pro sports where results are king.
edmontonoilers,lxm8hxc,2024-11-17 12:08:36,It's very reminiscent of how Koskinen played in his final year in Edmonton. Some games he stands on his head and wins it for the team but there are just too many bad games and flubs between those short stretches where he plays at his best.
edmontonoilers,lxm5lku,2024-11-17 11:52:34,I think management was hoping he would take a step forward this year so far looking like it’s the opposite unfortunately. He seemed to be trending upwards last season 
edmontonoilers,lxnk57z,2024-11-17 16:24:18,Im more disappointed in the regression from the overall defense not just skinner. It’s significantly worse than last year and we are seeing the effects of what we lost.
edmontonoilers,lxlsx71,2024-11-17 10:41:55,I haven't watched Blackwood lately but I was saying a similar thing awhile ago. Taking average goaltenders from losing teams has lots of benefits.
edmontonoilers,lxmabvn,2024-11-17 12:18:50,Said it last year at deadline and got shit on by this sub. Even Blackwood still struggles as a number one but he’s better than Shitter Stu
edmontonoilers,lxm0eja,2024-11-17 11:24:06,If we score 5 or 6 a game in the playoffs its no sweat!!
edmontonoilers,lxmq4iz,2024-11-17 13:44:15,Interesting stat thank you
edmontonoilers,lxlnuks,2024-11-17 10:12:08,It’s not the coach it’s every single goalie he has ever coached without exception
edmontonoilers,lxlk5nr,2024-11-17 09:49:32,Shot down by who? This sub has wanted Schwartz’s head for years
edmontonoilers,lxlqmhc,2024-11-17 10:28:35,I’m pretty sure everyone is with you on this one.
edmontonoilers,lxltpkw,2024-11-17 10:46:26,Wasn't it revealed during the playoffs last year that Skinner got his own goalie coach who isn't Schwartz?
edmontonoilers,lxlv2qq,2024-11-17 10:54:16,I heard that he is married to Katz niece or something.
edmontonoilers,lxlu36y,2024-11-17 10:48:36,Love that you think you're presenting a novel or original idea here lol. Noone ever thought of this until now!
edmontonoilers,lxltwkq,2024-11-17 10:47:34,Never. How many years have we been going on about this on here?
edmontonoilers,lxlu7ne,2024-11-17 10:49:19,They brought up his family last time. Think of the children!
edmontonoilers,lxm30g8,2024-11-17 11:38:23,This is one of the only major flaws with Lowetide. He *refuses* to even think Schwartz could be responsible despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
edmontonoilers,lxm2yxg,2024-11-17 11:38:09,With an above average goalie even.
edmontonoilers,lxmi6gn,2024-11-17 13:02:16,Where's the money coming from for an elite goaltender?
edmontonoilers,lxn2eyp,2024-11-17 14:49:21,You don’t have this team with an elite goalie though. They are expensive unless you luck out and find a diamond in the rough or have a career backup suddenly get hot. The team has salary cap issues as it is adding an elite goaltender requires a major restructuring of the roster. If it was as easy as just adding an elite goaltender don’t you think the team would’ve done that already?
edmontonoilers,lxlwnzo,2024-11-17 11:03:22,No cap space to pay an above average goalie
edmontonoilers,lxmdvm9,2024-11-17 12:38:33,Smith had his best years with us. Talbot has had similar stats everywhere he’s gone. This is a false narrative really. Just tell me who’s left and been way better?
edmontonoilers,lxm8cf1,2024-11-17 12:07:45,Always think this also Nuge Nurse and Skinner had a kid and went south. Hyman added another as well. Never know could be that hockey is 2nd on the mind.
edmontonoilers,lxmugds,2024-11-17 14:06:46,Statistically he’s actually worse than Koskinen. With arguably a much better team in front of him.
edmontonoilers,lxlqyst,2024-11-17 10:30:36,It’s all Bouchard’s fault.  No other explanation needed.If we got rid of him Skinner would be the best goalie in the league
edmontonoilers,lxlyg24,2024-11-17 11:13:12,Was supposed to be until Campbell crapped the bed
edmontonoilers,lxme88t,2024-11-17 12:40:30,Talbot is actually leading the league in S% among starters
edmontonoilers,lxlvzb0,2024-11-17 10:59:27,Pickard is a backup  not sure what Skinner is.
edmontonoilers,lxm9lo6,2024-11-17 12:14:46,Winnipeg 6-0 Columbus 6-1.  I don't think that stat holds up.  But the point is still correct we'd be in much better shape had Skinner been playing at least above average.
edmontonoilers,lxrk9t5,2024-11-18 10:10:43,You are not going to believe who is #2 in the NHL right now in GSAe
edmontonoilers,lxoof98,2024-11-17 20:15:15,That is who is cherish
edmontonoilers,lxndisf,2024-11-17 15:49:15,Both are playing like shit
edmontonoilers,lxmqhqp,2024-11-17 13:46:10,I mean a lot of the time it is
edmontonoilers,lxlyqtb,2024-11-17 11:14:53,"""Skinner is a slightly smaller pile of shit than it appears at first glance. But nonetheless still a giant pile of shit."""
edmontonoilers,lxlt66h,2024-11-17 10:43:20,The fact you argue that he’s actually 67/75 instead of 75/75 like either aren’t completely dogshit and where a bad goalie would be ranked is hilarious.
edmontonoilers,lxlwd00,2024-11-17 11:01:40,Uh… no. Per 60 completely skews stats as it includes all players who have played even a single game. Using your system Akira Shmid is a top 3 goalie in GSAx (he played 1 game lol).  It’s like using points/60 instead of actual points to determine who the top offensive players are. Even if we go with your flawed system Skinner is 61 out of 75 goalies in GSAx/60. Still absolutely horrible. 
edmontonoilers,lxn3eaj,2024-11-17 14:54:40,There are literally people in this very thread being critical of the skaters as well. Still need your goalies to make a damn save now and then. Look at last night perfect example. Stolarz kept the Leafs in it until our goalies crumbled.
edmontonoilers,lxmvvqe,2024-11-17 14:14:10,Rodrigue had a look in preseason. He’s not an NHL calibre goalie.
edmontonoilers,lxmb044,2024-11-17 12:22:35,You don’t need an elite goalie you just need an average to above average goalie that can give you 0.900 most games. This team is good enough to win with that kind of goaltending.
edmontonoilers,lxmd6ao,2024-11-17 12:34:39,Shows how good we were last year actually
edmontonoilers,lxps32j,2024-11-18 00:45:16,Lol if you think thats a realistic trade
edmontonoilers,lxljdyi,2024-11-17 09:44:37,> He’ll be ok. Pickard playing well behind him will be huge this year.He'll be ok for a backup. Pickard was really shaky last game and shouldnt depend on him for the #1 spot.Need to get a solid goalie
edmontonoilers,lxs6mqz,2024-11-18 12:08:35,he's incredibly bad east to west gets beat over the glove all day on shots from all over. When he's on his puck handling is great. Needs to hub the post better too. And he's bad in the first 5 shots of the game. Would love to see the stats on that actually.
edmontonoilers,lxn100e,2024-11-17 14:41:33,Except that other teams seem to consistently develop their goalies and our team doesn't. Goalies leave our team and often get better. Weird.
edmontonoilers,lxn6yej,2024-11-17 15:14:10,4 nations lol.  This guy isn’t even the 4th option anymore.
edmontonoilers,lxne1bz,2024-11-17 15:51:56,His peak is worse but he let's in less stinkers
edmontonoilers,lxnjrtp,2024-11-17 16:22:16,Love pickard but hes started 5/6 games against some of the worst offensive teams in the league.
edmontonoilers,lxo0eif,2024-11-17 17:54:37,"Hmmm... Pickard was (briefly) with the Leafs. I feel like an Oiler roster heuristic should be: ""No former Leaf goalies or defensemen."" Please Dermott prove me wrong..."
edmontonoilers,lxmcl3a,2024-11-17 12:31:23,This! He's the common denominator. Goalies typically improved once they left the oilers.... wonder why.
edmontonoilers,lxn79tb,2024-11-17 15:15:50,At the very least it’s worth a try. Schwartz isn’t exactly some goalie whisper that brings the best out of goalies so I’m sure there’s a dozen guys out there that are equally good if not better.
edmontonoilers,lxoqoew,2024-11-17 20:29:03,How does schwartz still have a job?
edmontonoilers,lxmojed,2024-11-17 13:36:07,Always has been
edmontonoilers,lxos3cs,2024-11-17 20:37:44,Yep I still don’t understand how he’s been there so long it’s wild!!
edmontonoilers,lxpeoan,2024-11-17 23:02:13,How many years does Schwartz need to be goalie coach where goalie after goalie doesn't improve or gets worse. Before that sinks in for management he might be the issue.
edmontonoilers,lxqj97z,2024-11-18 05:31:52,If they did so at the trade deadline last season they might have hoisted the cupNot saying Skinner was bad in the finals but if there was a more reliable goalie in the first three games in the finals...
edmontonoilers,lxrk49v,2024-11-18 10:09:51,Best we can do is future considerations.
edmontonoilers,lxmmrc1,2024-11-17 13:26:52,He’s playing with zero confidence right now and he doesn’t deserve any. You can see visibly that he’s struggling with it. Shoulders sag his movements are sluggish. He’s not stupid he is a bit fragile and seems to realize he’s playing himself out of the league.
edmontonoilers,lxmn35i,2024-11-17 13:28:37,Koskinen was much better than Skinner in his third full year. Koskinen was .903 with a 2.77 GAA while Skinner - with a much better team in front of him - is .877 with a 3.28. That’s the difference between average and worst goalie in the league.The skinner experiment might not be over but it may well be in its last chapter.
edmontonoilers,lxoa3fo,2024-11-17 18:51:16,With koskinen  we got saves ….
edmontonoilers,lxmbrzd,2024-11-17 12:26:52,He still might he’s pretty young and was kind of rushed.
edmontonoilers,lxlz3gq,2024-11-17 11:16:51,An average tender is light years better than what we have
edmontonoilers,lxnemwo,2024-11-17 15:55:05,Blackwood does pretty well I mean posting shutouts and above .900 sv% with that defense in front of him
edmontonoilers,lxmuv9b,2024-11-17 14:08:53,Been unhappy with our goaltending for a few years now. Skinner is too streaky with more bad games than good games. The next time he has a good game there will be a post about Skinner needing an apology from the haters. If you say anything bad about him you get down voted into oblivion because lots of people in this sub don't seem to look back more than a game or two for how well hes played.
edmontonoilers,lxm5sbi,2024-11-17 11:53:37,The crazy thing is Oilers almost did it last year :( 
edmontonoilers,lxnvaly,2024-11-17 17:25:36,There is a difference between having to score 5 goals to win 5-4 and consistently winning 5-2 with average goaltending. We need to stop relying on crazy offense to save sub par goaltending
edmontonoilers,lxlxc2h,2024-11-17 11:07:05,It's the hill Jason Gregor has been trying to die on for years now. 
edmontonoilers,lxlygq5,2024-11-17 11:13:18,You mention Schwartz and people downvote you by saying it's not him but all the goalies that he coach somehow sucked. They will tell you he shouldn't be fired because the players like him. Well it's like the responsible parent vs the non responsible parent that lets you stay up late and watch TV. He's not competent
edmontonoilers,lxlkw78,2024-11-17 09:54:09,I get torched every time I suggest it. It’s about the only thing the team hasn’t tried!
edmontonoilers,lxlrmeq,2024-11-17 10:34:26,I’ve been saying it for years so it’s about time..
edmontonoilers,lxm1j6c,2024-11-17 11:30:15,I think it was more of a psychology coach rather than a goalie coach.
edmontonoilers,lxm18m9,2024-11-17 11:28:38,Pretty sure it was Smith but could have been.
edmontonoilers,lxmd9vy,2024-11-17 12:35:12,Man this fake news needs to die. They hired Adam Francilla who’s a personal trainer. He’s worked with smith skinner and Helybyuck. It wasn’t their own goalie coach to replace Schwartz.
edmontonoilers,lxo4c65,2024-11-17 18:17:30,Mike Smith brought in his own coach.
edmontonoilers,lxlxtmb,2024-11-17 11:09:47,I remember hearing something about that as well.
edmontonoilers,lxmp4mq,2024-11-17 13:39:11,This has been debunked by numerous insiders
edmontonoilers,lxlxpmv,2024-11-17 11:09:09,Also heard that there is some ties to the Katz family through marriage.
edmontonoilers,lxm13pn,2024-11-17 11:27:53,Except that I’ve been on this bandwagon since before Talbot..
edmontonoilers,lxm4tnj,2024-11-17 11:48:18,"His argument is always along the lines of ""How can we know that Schwartz is the problem?"" It doesn't make sense. You need to make changes sometimes when things aren't working. Just like any other coach."
edmontonoilers,lxmvdjx,2024-11-17 14:11:33,what evidence?
edmontonoilers,lxmqbqr,2024-11-17 13:45:17,Nurse going on LTIR?
edmontonoilers,lxmljdy,2024-11-17 13:20:20,Idk maybe Bowman can make some strategic changes and figure something out…do you really feel comfortable making another deep run with Skinner in nets right now?
edmontonoilers,lxlwuat,2024-11-17 11:04:20,You don't need cap space for a new coach
edmontonoilers,lxnnzp4,2024-11-17 16:45:20,Yet there a more than a few examples of teams that are routinely drafting and developing 1A goalies.
edmontonoilers,lxn6tgv,2024-11-17 15:13:24,Talbot fell off a cliff his last year with us and didn't even look like a serviceable nhl tender and he figured it out after he left. Smith got here and said nope and brought his own coach in never worked with schwartz.Nearly every goalie schwartz has touched falls off a cliff statistically in year 3-4 regardless of the caliber of tender. There's a decade of data to show this. Other coaches around the league get shit canned for much less then the utter failure that his entire career has been.
edmontonoilers,lxn4ken,2024-11-17 15:01:10,Smith literally hired his own goalie coach because Schwartz was so bad
edmontonoilers,lxn28s0,2024-11-17 14:48:25,Dubnyk became a Veniza candidate 
edmontonoilers,lxmbrgu,2024-11-17 12:26:47,Sleep is important.
edmontonoilers,lxm56yu,2024-11-17 11:50:21,Then got bought out only to immediately go on player assistance or whatever it's called so the next team didn't have to pay for him. Wish he did that before getting bought out.
edmontonoilers,lxmohv9,2024-11-17 13:35:55,Closet spokesman
edmontonoilers,lxm2aog,2024-11-17 11:34:28,A 2B maybe.
edmontonoilers,lxlxkk9,2024-11-17 11:08:23,Where did they say he wasn't bad? OP was is using the wrong column and people should be made aware of that. That doesn't mean Skinner hasn't been bad.
edmontonoilers,lxltojf,2024-11-17 10:46:16,Another poster who can’t read charts.  We don’t know the numbers from the rest of the goalies as they’re not listed. It’s highly likely that Skinner is quite a bit above 67/75 in “goals saved above expected per 60”.
edmontonoilers,lxlxn67,2024-11-17 11:08:47,I never said he wasn’t horrible.  But using the chart OP provided there are no goalies who only played 1 game.   You are totally wrong about not using points/60 or GSA/60 though.   I hope you realize that.  Otherwise you’d say podkolzin is better than Kane because he has more points this season.
edmontonoilers,lxn4ep4,2024-11-17 15:00:18,I literally implied in my comment that Stu is underperforming and needs to be better. My point is that no one calls the skaters AHLers because of a poor stretch. Skinner has been league average every year he’s been in the league why does a poor stretch make him useless when the rest of the team (except Drai) is in the same boat?
edmontonoilers,lxpw9mx,2024-11-18 01:23:48,Include a first round pick and it seems like Boston might go for it
edmontonoilers,lxlnxto,2024-11-17 10:12:42,Actually Pickard and Skinner are both backup goalies!
edmontonoilers,lxqpqfh,2024-11-18 06:37:43,Lol
edmontonoilers,lxs9l7d,2024-11-18 12:23:31,Hes top 5 in the league in the zone and hes last in the league off the rushThere was a good breakdown of it here somewhere
edmontonoilers,lxn3fv3,2024-11-17 14:54:55,i’m struggling to think of an oilers goalie in the last ten years that has held the reputation of being a legit starter after leaving the oilers. talbot? is that it? the rest are career backups or not even in the league anymore. also how many teams in the league are consistently developing their goalies because it’s definitely not all of them. the ones who do often draft them rather high and have more defensive systems in place than the oilers. oilers just don’t put enough effort into acquiring good goalies for the staff to work with that’s been the common theme of the last decade not some boogeyman goalie coach.
edmontonoilers,lxn9f7r,2024-11-17 15:27:22,He was considered coming into the season and earlier but of course his performance now takes him out of the list.
edmontonoilers,lxmhc4b,2024-11-17 12:57:38,He also works with Tristan Jarry in the off season and Pens have basically kicked him off the team. Lol
edmontonoilers,lxn20b7,2024-11-17 14:47:06,It's been the only consistent thing other than the poor goaltending (overall) of the last...*Gestures Vaguely*.. foreverWe've got to try at least... Right?!
edmontonoilers,lxmlbjx,2024-11-17 13:19:11,"Chabot was his predecessor and we had the same issue. Maybe it's not the goalie coaching? Certainly not a ""common denominator"" if there's more than one.[edit: For those that want to remember back to the last goalie coach firing: https://www.reddit.com/r/EdmontonOilers/comments/2na0ou/oilers_have_fired_goaltending_coach_freddie/]"
edmontonoilers,lxrl2j5,2024-11-18 10:15:14,I’ve wondered this for years. Massive turnover in management and other roles but Schwartz still manages to have a job through organizational purges year in and year out. Yes one could argue that goalie quality is hit or miss but having the same system and coach delivering (presumably) the same thing and never changing probably has a big effect as well. I’ve been saying for awhile that the Oilers need to run with three goalies and this year is proving that. All that being said I hope Stu picks it up and he and Pickard become a solid tandem this year. I’m unsure who they’d get to be the third goalie as good consistent goalies are obviously at a premium. Should be interesting to see how it plays out.
edmontonoilers,lxmo7dr,2024-11-17 13:34:27,Oh yes overall by the numbers Koskinen did better. There's no denying that.I'm just saying that they both seem to suffer the same type of consistency issues. Actually looking at the stats Koskinen's 2020-2021 season might be the better comparison considering his win percentage is more similar to Skinner's right now.I suppose the other thing to consider here is the number of games played. Skinner has only played a dozen games or so thus far to which we might have to wait for a larger sample size to see if Skinner can pull himself up closer to usual average.
edmontonoilers,lxneyw3,2024-11-17 15:56:51,Kinda makes you wonder how koskinen would’ve fared behind this current team. I believe he was the best goalie in the KHL before we acquired him. If he was a .903 playing on that ass team…
edmontonoilers,lxp9gex,2024-11-17 22:26:36,League goaltending has been declining for a decade so those numbers might be closer than you think. If the trend continues sub .900 will be league average. 
edmontonoilers,lxr2bvn,2024-11-18 08:18:41,Kind of? Campbell was supposed to be the starter for years and Skinner was to back up and develop for a good portion of Campbell’s contract.
edmontonoilers,lxnfwso,2024-11-17 16:01:27,He's playing well above expected and will probably regress the moment he lands in Edmonton. We will be buying high on a goalie that historically hasn't been that good
edmontonoilers,lxp7y2c,2024-11-17 22:16:42,That defense doesn’t seem worse than the guys manning Edmonton blue line. They’re also paid more reasonably. We’ve got almost 1/4 cap hit in Bouchard/nurse.
edmontonoilers,lxnutao,2024-11-17 17:22:56,Yup..  I have said same thing over the years.  I stopped saying anything because I’m arguing with a rock wall at this point.  He is a great guy and gets extra support because of this.  We shit on Campbell and Stu was only mildly better.  The overall narrative is the defense is to fault not our goalie. We just need someone consistent that can put up over .900.  Doesn’t seem like too much of an ask as most goalies in nhl fit this requirement.  I liked Smith but his inconsistency killed morale when we blow a game from soft goals.  Then next game they shutout.  Problem is we hang our heads on the games we know we should have won and have a hard time playing consistently. An average goalie is just as effective one win and one loss but it won’t kill the morale of the team.  What is Toronto paying for stolarz?  Peanuts and he is playing well.  We need to find someone like him.

edmontonoilers,lxllr2q,2024-11-17 09:59:27,Idk where you’re suggesting it then because there was a thread about Schwartz the other day and everyone was calling for his head
edmontonoilers,lxmpzx0,2024-11-17 13:43:35,Maybe Skinner should give that guy a call?
edmontonoilers,lxmcsgd,2024-11-17 12:32:30,No it was a personal trainer who trains goalies. He worked with Mike smith and skinner and he works with Hellybyuck. Our fans created this narrative that they hired their own goalie coach which is just false.
edmontonoilers,lxmp8fb,2024-11-17 13:39:43,Which is wild since Schwartz was hired in 2014I don’t like Schwartz anymore than anyone else but being on the bandwagon since before Talbot is quite literally one year after he became goalie coach
edmontonoilers,lxnbkan,2024-11-17 15:39:00,Pick any goalie he's worked with lmao
edmontonoilers,lxn2wl0,2024-11-17 14:52:00,Trolling or have you run the numbers and have an actual target for the oilers to go after?
edmontonoilers,lxmoa4s,2024-11-17 13:34:51,Luckily we won't have to worry about another run if Skinner keeps it up
edmontonoilers,lxn1s7f,2024-11-17 14:45:53,What I'm comfortable with and what are realistic options are 2 very different things. Imagine if we had 5 McDrai's... same thing.  Skinner is still young and we've been going deep with him I'm not that worried.  I'd rather see a goalie coach change - that's a realistic change to want.
edmontonoilers,lxn7jlo,2024-11-17 15:17:18,Smith hired a personal trainer. Our amazing fan base made up that he wouldn’t work with schwartz when it’s 100% not true. I’m still amazed it’s lasted this long without people doing a google search. You’re part of the problem. Tough to take you people seriously when you just parrot everyone else.
edmontonoilers,lxn5h05,2024-11-17 15:06:02,Smith hired a personal trainer named adam francilia because his body was falling apart near the end of his career. Our fans created this fake narrative that he hired a coach and wouldn’t work with Schwartz when it was completely untrue. Crazy that this is still being copied and pasted around here. You could’ve googled it instead of being a parrot.
edmontonoilers,lxn4i6x,2024-11-17 15:00:50,Dubnyk wasn’t coached by Schwartz. He was traded January 2014. Schwartz was hired November 2014.

edmontonoilers,lxm8zes,2024-11-17 12:11:19,You can actually just look up the stats instead of insinuating BS. He's 61/75. He's shit.
edmontonoilers,lxlvpt8,2024-11-17 10:57:57,‘There are 8 goalies worse than Skinner’.Make up your mind ffs lol it’s not people not knowing how to use charts it’s you thinking you’re fucking Rainman and arbitrarily deciding which is the best stat to use to measure Skinners inability to be a good goaltender. And he’s 61/75 using gsaa/60 which is guess what still terrible.
edmontonoilers,lxlyuxb,2024-11-17 11:15:31,Here maybe this will help you: https://moneypuck.com/goalies.htmAnd Kane hasn’t played this season.
edmontonoilers,lxs6y84,2024-11-18 12:10:13,lol......hey can we have your great goalie and we'll give you a mid D man with a terrible contract. And we're out of 1st round picks our prospect pool is shallow
edmontonoilers,lxpwg0b,2024-11-18 01:25:28,It doesn’t matter if Boston would go for it. Nurse can’t be traded unless he wants to and given how close he is to McDavid and Drai on a contender that will never happen.
edmontonoilers,lxscoon,2024-11-18 12:39:00,I'm no stat expert but I'd love to see that as well. I'm not even sure what in the zone means TBH?
edmontonoilers,lxs7ttj,2024-11-18 12:14:39,there are plenty of teams that develop their goalies hell there are teams like Vancouver who haven't had their starter for a season and their 3rd stringer was better than skinner
edmontonoilers,lxovd4k,2024-11-17 20:57:49,Didn't he work with him with the Oil Kings?
edmontonoilers,lxmof2m,2024-11-17 13:35:31,Maybe get grant fuhr to help out?Remember fuhr and moog never used goalie coaches so perhaps getting fuhr might work?
edmontonoilers,lxmphnr,2024-11-17 13:41:04,It’s possible his mental state is approaching critical levels. He is by all accounts a nice guy internalizes mistakes talks about moving forward and getting better yadda yadda yadda. He’s not a swaggering dink like a Tom Barasso Jordan Binnington or Patrick Roy - it hurts him visibly when he shits the bed yet again and isn’t playing well. He has no confidence at all. Zero. He slumps his shoulders lays on the ice shakes his head is visibly aware that he’s playing himself out of the league and pissing away McDavid and Draisaitl’s prime years. It’s approaching urgent levels where the coach needs to do something. Fans are bailing on belief. Quickly.
edmontonoilers,lxnkqa3,2024-11-17 16:27:30,As a sharks fan that is exactly what I want lol
edmontonoilers,lxmeu46,2024-11-17 12:43:52,No they don’t. Dubnyk took nearly 3 years to be worth a shit. Talbot has stayed basically the same and his best year still remains his second year with us
edmontonoilers,lxlo1zk,2024-11-17 10:13:23,Hmm I’ll have to look for it.
edmontonoilers,lxmt68v,2024-11-17 14:00:08,Should have him on speed dial.
edmontonoilers,lxnrtqr,2024-11-17 17:06:23,"I mean they said it in the playoffs that Skinner worked with a different goalie coach when Picks was put in during the Van series. Fans didn't ""create this narrative."" Maybe the guy he hired is a trainer but you can hardly fault fans for thinking Skinner hired a new goalie coach when they're literally told that on air."
edmontonoilers,lxmsv6l,2024-11-17 13:58:33,I meant to say before Talbot was traded. He went from good to mediocre in that time.
edmontonoilers,lxmsdmg,2024-11-17 13:56:03,What can I say I was ahead of the curve.
edmontonoilers,lxng49o,2024-11-17 16:02:31,Prove it bud. The personal trainer rumor was stu and I'm all for agreeing with you that rumors don't help but Smith brought his own guy in off rip. Either way this is completely irrelevant. The only goalie that didn't get worse during schwartz reign here was a 40 year old. There are articles upon articles showing these statistics and pleading for his firing for over 5 years.Regardless why does this guy get a pass when nobody else in the league does? Noone else on this staff does? He's been an utter failure for over a decade giving this team below average results and regression and similar issues year in year out regardless of the goalie. Defense bad? Coaches fired. Offense bad? Coaches fired. ST's bad? Coaches fired. Goalies bad? Better hang onto him...why? Why has he gained the benefit of the doubt for years when every other coach in a results based league gets nearly zero leash? He has produced nothing positive period it's well beyond time to move on.
edmontonoilers,lxnpv51,2024-11-17 16:55:35,You know what you're right. I am incorrect.

edmontonoilers,lxly89q,2024-11-17 11:12:01,I made my point.  He’s not last place.  Even using your stat he’s 8th worst out of the 15 displayed by OP
edmontonoilers,lxlud3m,2024-11-17 10:50:11,There’s a huge difference between below average and last out of 75.
edmontonoilers,lxlzuza,2024-11-17 11:21:06,I know he hasnt played.  That’s the point need to use the proper measuring stick for goalies and players.
edmontonoilers,lxselec,2024-11-18 12:48:28,They got a 25th overall and a 4th line player for him from Ottawa. Never know. Maybe people see more in Nurse. Seth Jones is an example of an overpaid d-man with terrible analytics and bad hockey sense that still gets moved.
edmontonoilers,lxsdcby,2024-11-18 12:42:16,I cant find the post but heres what it said:•⁠Last 2 years Skinner has the worst SV% in the league off of odd man rushes and full rush.•⁠He’s not a good goalie at backing up managing speed gap.•⁠At the same time he has a top 5 SV% in the league in the zone when he’s set can see his reads and the D is good with their sticks.•⁠He says off the rush Skinner is not an NHL goalie but in the zone he is.•⁠In the playoffs last year Edmonton was 2nd in protecting the goalie off the rush that’s why he succeeded and had a lot of strong games.•⁠So it depends on Oilers system if they play up and down the ice a lot he’s not the right goalie for this team.This explains A LOT about his inconsistency and his high and lows it fully depends on the team protecting him off the rush when he’s hot and when he’s not.
edmontonoilers,lxtqzvx,2024-11-18 16:52:24,ya i’m not saying there aren’t teams who have that as a huge organizational strength. i’m saying it’s more of an exception rather than the norm and that this issue in regards to the oilers goes far beyond “FiRe ScHwArTz” because it takes more than one guy to draft goalies and develop them at all stages of their career.
edmontonoilers,lxmoxxw,2024-11-17 13:38:12,The last thing the Oilers need is more OBC.
edmontonoilers,lxnz01i,2024-11-17 17:46:37,Would be more interesting to bring in Mike Smith for that

edmontonoilers,lxm2ya0,2024-11-17 11:38:03,Correct and /60 is not a proper measuring stick. It had never been in hockey statistics and never will. It is meant to be used in very specific circumstances like if you’re trying to evaluate a prospect who had a 5 game stint in the NHL. Hopefully that helps. Moneypuck and NaturalStatTrick are good websites if hockey statistics interest you. You seem to be incredible at reading charts! 
edmontonoilers,lxsengo,2024-11-18 12:48:45,hmmm....fair good insight. But really so he's good when he's having a good day and the D is optimal essentially. That's not good enough especially with our D and speed. We give up a lot of rushes now.
edmontonoilers,lxts66l,2024-11-18 16:58:21,fully agree I getcha. I mean i don't know what the general opinion is of our scouting team anymore but I know our scouting (and development for that matter) has been under great scrutiny for some time. We don't end up with many of our 2nd round picks on our roster.The Hawks filled out and won cups on 2nd round depth as did the pens and (i believe) kings.
edmontonoilers,lxn3c4w,2024-11-17 14:54:21,I'd have agreed in the past but Paul Coffey and the blue line improvement can't be ignored.

edmontonoilers,lxn6nup,2024-11-17 15:12:33,Not sure I follow your message. He went from good with the Rangers and slowly got worse year over year. I suggested getting rid of goalie coach and people lost their minds. I’m simply saying that our goalie coach has taken several promising goaltenders and made them worse..
edmontonoilers,lxsk5nh,2024-11-18 13:16:26,I agree. It just explains why he seems very inconsistent.
edmontonoilers,lxn3gax,2024-11-17 14:54:58,Let's not ignore all the other times it hasn't worked.Also Fuhr wasn't known for low scoring games. The team simply outscored the competition every night. Grant could let in 5 and they'd get 6 or 7. Probably not a winning strategy when our guys only had 2 shots on a major penalty.
edmontonoilers,lxmnt31,2024-11-17 13:32:21,Literally all the ones who didn't retire from the NHL/leave for a different league **including Dubnyk** lmao. You can click on their names and see that their SV% and GAA improved after leaving the Oilers even with similar games played.

edmontonoilers,lxpa0b9,2024-11-17 22:30:14,Smith wasn’t washed. He was an anomaly that stayed solid even when he aged up. He just played a style that was beyond unorthodox once Hasek hung em up
edmontonoilers,lxn75fc,2024-11-17 15:15:11,OBC isn’t a different idea Coffey is literally the one successful OB that they’ve implemented out of at least a half dozen and he was extremely hesitant to even take the position to begin with because of the prior OBC issues. That seemed to be the consensus cause anyway but if he was hesitant for other issues feel free to correct me.
edmontonoilers,lxmp6od,2024-11-17 13:39:28,"Where did I say anything about being a ""solid A""?You asked me which of them became *better* after leaving the Oilers. The answer as I stated is all of the ones who didn't retire or leave for the AHL or some euro league."
edmontonoilers,lxn31aq,2024-11-17 14:52:42,Two solid options though that's for sure.After the start Stolarz has had it's hard to argue we wouldn't be better without him then again the leafs are playing some of the best defensive hockey they've played in a while and Tanev has looked very very good.Skinner is fine when the defense is pulling their weight.It's really hard to win a hockey game in the NHL down a top 4 defensemen for 2/3 of the game
edmontonoilers,lxldvph,2024-11-17 09:07:42,It’s really disheartening to see that Nurse who gets rightfully and unfairly criticized at different points finally hits a stride and streak for playing well and then takes a hit right to the head. Fuck Ryan Reeves whether he meant it or not there should be games lost for him. There is no place in the league for hits to the head from any team.
edmontonoilers,lxlfg6z,2024-11-17 09:18:33,Bouchard needs to be benched next game. To just give up like that was hugely telling on what type of team mate he is.

edmontonoilers,lxlfnqn,2024-11-17 09:19:59,The Oilers better be planning for a couple of big moves at the deadline. Otherwise there is no justification for running this bottom-6 and that D core out every night. Having to watch Perry and Ryan play every game just so they can accrue deadline space will only be worth it if they maximize every available dollar and asset at the deadline. Leaving Kanes surgery to the last possible minute will only make sense if he remains out until the playoffs and they spend that money to improve the roster. Otherwise they really could use the toughness that he brings to the lineup as soon as possible because this is one of the softest teams I've seen here in Edmonton.
edmontonoilers,lxllfo8,2024-11-17 09:57:31,Bouchard was egregiously bad in the last 10 minutes of that game.
edmontonoilers,lxnbj6y,2024-11-17 15:38:49,Really hope Knob holds his players accountable when they do shit like Bouchard did last night. I live in Vancouver so I was listening to a Rick Tocchet post game interview on the radio last year. He was asked about Elias Pettersson’s 3 point night and he replied something along the lines of “yeah he played pretty well offensively but he made a few costly turnovers and needs to improve his defensive game.” Which is exactly what Knob should be doing with Bouchard. “Yes we all know you have a nice shot. But if you want anything close to a double digit contract next season you have got to play with 100% effort every game or your ass will be taped to the bench.”
edmontonoilers,lxldsfa,2024-11-17 09:07:02,Waiting for an update on Nurse today and hopefully he's not out very long.
edmontonoilers,lxle0rg,2024-11-17 09:08:40,No goal on the 5 min very dishonourable.Killing the 3 on 5 nice. Made up for it.Hope Nurse is up and at em again soon poor guy.Blowing another 3rd period lead very dishonourable.Still got a point but my two coworker leaf fanatics will not shut up now. I told them that was their Stanley Cup so enjoy the feeling.
edmontonoilers,lxljh3b,2024-11-17 09:45:10,On the bright side the PK! However this team needs to figure out how to hold a lead. Man I hate losing to Toronto work is going to be insufferable tomorrow here in Ontario.
edmontonoilers,lxnr448,2024-11-17 17:02:26,Well anyway. Nuge is playing in his 900th game tomorrow. He will be the second player to play his first 900 games consecutively as an oiler. Because Smyth didn’t hit 900 games *as an oiler* until his second stint with the team. Lowe played 966 consecutive games as an oiler & then another 71 games in his second stint.Smyth played 770 consecutive games as an oiler & then another 201 games several years later. So next season when nuge plays his 1000th game he will be the first player to do so consecutively as an oiler.
edmontonoilers,lxn4qz7,2024-11-17 15:02:09,Well that was infuriating. While a lot of attention rightfully gets placed on Bouchard and Skinner for the loss can I just focus on on another issue. Our secondary scoring is an absolute joke. Nuge Hyman Skinner and Arvidsson have sucked royally this season. Bouchard Ekholm and Nurse have more points than them. Kulak is one behind from being equal. Nuge and Hyman haven't been factors on the PP either. Our offense is being hard carried by McDrai and it's just not good enough. The most frustrating thing is we're playing the type of hockey that wins. We're limiting the amount of high danger chances against we're creating scoring chances. Crappy goaltending bad secondary scoring and individual mistakes are costing us. Also after Reaves hit on Nurse I wish we reacted. No real increase in physical play or even a fight. Really missed Kane last night.
edmontonoilers,lxmguif,2024-11-17 12:54:58,Any update on Nurse? I fear he could have a serious injury.
edmontonoilers,lxn6fpi,2024-11-17 15:11:19,Hyman and Nuge are amongst the coldest finishers in the league right now and they spend all their time with McDavid and get PP minutes. I love them and Knob but something in that equation needs to change.
edmontonoilers,lxlozyd,2024-11-17 10:19:00,Is there an update on Nurse? Hoping good health to him
edmontonoilers,lxlk0zz,2024-11-17 09:48:41,Apparently it's not even an in person hearing for Reaves he gets 5 max for that disgusting hit. Clown league
edmontonoilers,lxllpvr,2024-11-17 09:59:15,We needed at least 1 key save from Skinner. Bouch - wtf.

edmontonoilers,lxlia9o,2024-11-17 09:37:27,On the bright side. We got a point even though Bouch and Skinner completely fumbled the bag.What worries me: these goals against are just too easy. We are not even playing bad defensively. The shots against look good in most games. Skinner needs to step up (I don't even wanna talk about Bouch). I always thought that other goalies have their best games against us. But that is not it. It's that every other goalie looks like prime Brodeur compared to Stu. And I really like Stu but we won't win anything if he does not step up
edmontonoilers,lxlqzfd,2024-11-17 10:30:43,I am so sick of hits like this. Nurse is no little guy. You have to go out of your way to target the head. Reaves is a waste of space out there. The loss was terrible too and Bouch and Stu need to figure it the fuck out. Just want Nurse to be alright. My favourite Oiler and he was playing his best hockey with Kulak.
edmontonoilers,lxlej21,2024-11-17 09:12:12,Oilers need to find a way to lock the game down in the 3rd these late goals are killing us.  Leafs had nothing going.
edmontonoilers,lxmwt81,2024-11-17 14:19:04,Tough to lose in OT to the Leafs but I’ll take a point.  We have the worst goaltending in the league and we’re somehow still in a playoff spot. They’ll be fine!
edmontonoilers,lxn97ap,2024-11-17 15:26:13,Just saw both Bouchard plays since I missed the game last night. Bench that man for the rest of the season holy shit
edmontonoilers,lxnab9n,2024-11-17 15:32:09,Why do we keep losing to the leafs 7-2-1 last 10 games
edmontonoilers,lxlnlm6,2024-11-17 10:10:37,Fuck Reaves. Bouchard and Skinner need to be better. Nuge needs to get going offensively. I hope Nurse is not out long and he feels better.
edmontonoilers,lxmgllw,2024-11-17 12:53:36,Something is seriously up with Nuge. I don’t think he has a had a good game this season. He has 3 5v5 points and a points per 60 (5v5) of 0.74 good for 323rd out of 386 forwards who have played 10 games this year. The only forward with less on our team is Derek Ryan and this is a guy who has spent over 70% of his ice time with mcdavid.
edmontonoilers,lxo7wnh,2024-11-17 18:38:30,Campbell has been put on waivers by Detroit.
edmontonoilers,lxorwmj,2024-11-17 20:36:36,Can we just sign a goalie please I don't care what It costs
edmontonoilers,lxnjnin,2024-11-17 16:21:36,The DoPS wheel has spoken and he's been given a 5 game ban.
edmontonoilers,lxohs9w,2024-11-17 19:35:23,Before the season began many of us were saying we need an elite goalie and help on D to be a contender. That has not changed.
edmontonoilers,lxlmcpn,2024-11-17 10:03:08,Time for Rodrigue and picks tandem baby!
edmontonoilers,lxmzzln,2024-11-17 14:36:02,I miss typing **STUUUUU** I don't feel confident when I see a 2 on 1 coming our way. Or even a shot from the point.
edmontonoilers,lxoptm0,2024-11-17 20:23:49,Its crazy how at the beginning of the year we were probably gonna have 4 maybe 5 players for team Canada in the 4 nations thing and now they have all played themselves off the team and only mcdavid will go. How can you justify taking skinner? Hyman and Nuge I can’t see making it anymore. Bouchard maybe will still make it.
edmontonoilers,lxn3bee,2024-11-17 14:54:14,Skinner is young and is paid accordingly. Let's not run our current best goalie prospect out of town. He's Inconsistent yes but he has at times been very very good and bailed out the team. He's also cost the team a few games this year and at the start of last year. Chill. Let stu cook.
edmontonoilers,lxlevw2,2024-11-17 09:14:41,I'm gonna be optimistic The world is not ending the Oilers will be fine they will sort this out. Our pk was much better this game and for a 80% of the game we were better than Toronto just unfortunate Bouch had multiple brain fades towards the end and we still got a point out of it.They're starting to put the pieces together we as a whole are not playing bad by any means and we are still a lot better than last years start. It might take a few more games but I think the Oil will really get going soon. They always do this.
edmontonoilers,lxlg50q,2024-11-17 09:23:13,Oof
edmontonoilers,lxltzkl,2024-11-17 10:48:03,Oilers are a soft team this year an addition to once again having barely any secondary scoring and once again having shit goaltending.
edmontonoilers,lxmegwo,2024-11-17 12:41:51,One other thing worth noting.. How important was that 5 minute man advantage that we failed to convert. Is there a stat for our 5 minute PP? Correct me if I am wrong I feel like even during our best PP percentage times we failed to take advantage of 5 minute man advantage . If we scored 1-2 goals in that 5 minutes PP the game would have been secured.
edmontonoilers,lxlemlq,2024-11-17 09:12:53,I hope bouchard doesn't get paid this off-season he doesn't deserve a big pay day. He doesn't skate hard and turns it over almost every time he's on the ice.
edmontonoilers,lxn7hv1,2024-11-17 15:17:02,Maybe this will wake Bouch up as this was not great moment for him and cost the team a point
edmontonoilers,lxlvarc,2024-11-17 10:55:33,When are we ready to have the conversation about Pickard taking over the #1 spot for a bit…? This teams confidence in skinner has to be at 0 at the moment. Every single mistake ends up in the back of the net. Sitting at an .877 save % now never able to figure out a big save. Also I know Nurse is most likely out for a game or few. But personally im sitting bouch for the MTL game tomorrow. He needs to understand that this effort he is putting in is simply not good enough. Brain dead plays can’t get shots on net mix that with never being a great actual defender…. Not a good mix. Funny thing is there was serious conversations of him commanding $10 million next season!! If this play keeps up he’ll be lucky to grab half of that.
edmontonoilers,lxle1i9,2024-11-17 09:08:49,After that display I'm completely unsure if this team should target (with limited options) a top 4 D or another (also limited options) goaltender.
edmontonoilers,lxmy8nx,2024-11-17 14:26:38,for the loss last night you could blame skinner or bouch and it would make sense they both were pretty weak. but for all the games that we dominate other teams it seems like we have games like this where our lack of depth in defense and goaltending get exploited. no matter how deep the forward group is you can’t expect them to out score defensive lapses every night. it’s been the same story for years now yet last summer the management doubled down on keeping our weaknesses. i feel like it’s gonna be the same thing all season long we’ll dominate some teams with our offensive strength and lose to others when they shut the door and capitalize on our lapses.
edmontonoilers,lxlt9by,2024-11-17 10:43:49,Get rid of Nuge on the pp and replace him with skinner or Arvy
edmontonoilers,lxmnw2o,2024-11-17 13:32:48,We did not get a point last game… they LOST a point… AGAIN. Please learn how to close out a fucking game pleaseeeeee
edmontonoilers,lxm5x7x,2024-11-17 11:54:22,Holy fuck you'd think the sky was falling looking at all these comments 
edmontonoilers,lxn4hn3,2024-11-17 15:00:45,Hoping Nurse is okay. Ugly hit.Remember that game against the Leafs last season when the Oilers were ahead 3-1 and then McLeod passed the puck right to Marner in front of his own net? Snowballed in to a 7-4 loss.Remember what happened after that? It's a long season. We banked a point and played pretty well for 55 minutes against a good opponent. We've got a good team.
edmontonoilers,lxlu2ze,2024-11-17 10:48:34,Bouchard is absolutely dog water this year. The game with the Isles was his best game of the year (and even then he had a massive lapse in the first that lead to a 2 on 0 in the crease). It sucks but I’m glad people are starting to recognize that Bouch’s fancy stats don’t actually tell the story. He’s costing us gamesThe problem is until we know what’s up with Nurse Bouch can’t be stapled to the bench. And all the Nurse haters are about to see how fucking bad the D is without him
edmontonoilers,lxmio18,2024-11-17 13:04:55,People where clamouring for a homegrown goalie for fucking years and now that the Oil have one folks are ready to run him outta town because of a rough start to the year... Less than a year after he backstopped em to game 7 of the SCF.Love how fickle you lot are
edmontonoilers,lxlyubw,2024-11-17 11:15:26,I genuinely want the Oilers to ship out skinner for another guy so bad so fans can finally realize it's a top to bottom organization problem and not an individual goalie problem. You send Skinner to Vancouver I bet he cooks lmao
edmontonoilers,lxlocjc,2024-11-17 10:15:08,I still can’t digest the fact that we had a chance to draft Jesper Wallstedt and we didn’t.. Holland was never a good drafter..  Imagine picking Zadina when Quinn Hughes was still available?
edmontonoilers,lxm1v6q,2024-11-17 11:32:04,Oilers every season (atleast based on last 5-6 seasons)Slow start; very strong second half to finish .. slow start always denying us the home ice advantage Goal keeping issues to start the season; gets better as we progress Lack of secondary scoring ; Lack of good second pairing RDLack of trust on younger players In spite of all these we had couple of strong run at the Stanley cup including the finals. That I would say was due to some insane performance from our top players. Imagine if Organization was smart enough to address the issues in a timely manner..
edmontonoilers,lxols0o,2024-11-17 19:59:10,Skinner should have a break and Nuge too !
edmontonoilers,lxpqsri,2024-11-18 00:34:02,whelp tonight the best possible outcome.  Vegas and Van both lose in reg.
edmontonoilers,lxmzeyl,2024-11-17 14:33:01,I haven’t caught up to the season much this year since I’ve been busy from work but looking at these comments I can safely assume the team is 5-12-1 or something like that? That’s a terrible start I cannot believe this.
edmontonoilers,lxlyqbx,2024-11-17 11:14:48,Mccloud and Holloway have had way better seasons so far than henrique or nuge and by a lot. Broberg was dominating until he got hurt. Even foegele is crushing Ardvison or Skinner combined. JJ should be fired he's straight trash. The team was too soft last year in the finals without E. Kane and JJ brought in the two softest forwards in the league.
edmontonoilers,lxn9iq1,2024-11-17 15:27:52,I don’t think there’s a problem with skinner it’s just the coaching he can play really good but he’s too inconsistent same with Pickard
edmontonoilers,lxlv9sq,2024-11-17 10:55:24,Re-posting this question from the Post-Game Thread which I should have posted here to begin with:Rough losing a game the Oilers were dominating for the majority of the game because of two mistakes in the 3rd….Talking about mistakes I hope someone with goaltender experience can help me explain why Skinner didn’t come out of the net before the Leafs scored the 3-2. I was screaming for him to come out since there was plenty of time but admittedly I’m no goalie so I don’t know what their instructions are in these situations.Anyone care to reflect on the moment?
edmontonoilers,lxm3p34,2024-11-17 11:42:08,[removed]
edmontonoilers,lxm6jl9,2024-11-17 11:57:46,People really want to throw Skinner under the bus for last night's game but this was solely on Bouchard imo. He made such a dumb play on the tying goal but the unforgivable one is the breakaway goal after that. He just quit. Straight up quit on the play. This guy needs to be benched and possibly even traded. As for Skinner people keep saying his save percentage is garbage...it is. But this guy ONLY sees point blank shots with no help at all from his D men. I love Pickard and think he should be the starter but I think it's idiotic to believe that if we get a better goalie that all of Edmontons problem will go away. This is a team issue the mental toughness is lacking and the Oilers are prone to making gigantic errors that cost them wins.
edmontonoilers,lxlvahe,2024-11-17 10:55:30,Fun game last night. Lol what a joke. Every game with skinner in net I will assume is an L beforehand. Nice guy yeah yeah but he is fucking garbage in net and EVERY shot towards him is dangerous.
edmontonoilers,lxn9y1b,2024-11-17 15:30:09,The Oilers are in deep trouble.  The whole attitude is we are fine nothing to worry. We are very soft team with little or no pride .  Our goaltending is close to the worst in the NHL. Skinner is not good enough game to game.  Did anyone notice the Oiler players reaction when Nurse took the big hit from Reaves? No reaction at all.  Mark my words wake up guys or you will be facing a short season.
edmontonoilers,lxm9mxu,2024-11-17 12:14:58,Looks like I haven't been missing anything; I've watched one game this season because it was on at a house party.
edmontonoilers,lxme6bc,2024-11-17 12:40:12,At this point I’m all in on trading Bouchard for a goalie or different defenseman.  I know I know sounds “who will play defense if he’s gone etc etc.  I think he’s pretty good trade bait.  Maybe a Bouchard J Skinner even Nuge or Hyman to get some decent return.
edmontonoilers,lxoige4,2024-11-17 19:39:18,Is it time for a major shakeup? The oilers are still on a good heater but the same problems keep popping up: horrible turnovers and inconsistent goaltending. What are people's thoughts on trading Hyman??  His stock value rn is probably very low but he did get 50 goals and we could get a decent defenseman or a better goalie in return. I really don't think he's going to be helping this team in the long run this season. He's getting lots of pp min with the best players in the world and still can't score. It's probably a hasty idea but we need some help in the goaltending and defense department
edmontonoilers,lxmezzl,2024-11-17 12:44:47,Why isn’t Arvidsson playing?  I heard he was injury prone and I guess it’s true?  Come on man 20games in and you’re out for multiple games already?  Great signing…
edmontonoilers,lxlmuiz,2024-11-17 10:06:04,He deserves to sit out a few games in the press box he's been complete ass this entire season. I doubt it happens though especially since I expect Nurse to be out after that hit.
edmontonoilers,lxllppd,2024-11-17 09:59:13,I agree. But we are down a D. So that’ll be a hard thing to do. Necessary but hard.
edmontonoilers,lxlkdiz,2024-11-17 09:50:55,The weirdest part of that play was Bouchard’s reaction after the goal… turned on the jets about to break out of the zone(obviously not realizing the leafs scored?)Edit: spelling
edmontonoilers,lxm55p9,2024-11-17 11:50:09,He’s a team mate from Oakville and Leafs fan.
edmontonoilers,lxmhm6v,2024-11-17 12:59:10,Right? This is a team that’s 7-3-1 in their last 11. Just because it’s embarrassing losing to the Leafs doesn’t mean this team is beyond hope.
edmontonoilers,lxmqk22,2024-11-17 13:46:30,100%. The overreactions are crazy.
edmontonoilers,lxmzbvj,2024-11-17 14:32:34,I feel like the overreactions are way worse than last year some of the takes are insane lol
edmontonoilers,lxlszqz,2024-11-17 10:42:18,Even if he’s out half a season don’t they accrue a decent amount of cap space? Asking because I’m uncertain
edmontonoilers,lxlpyze,2024-11-17 10:24:45,So was Skinner. He allowed goals on 3 of the last 4 shots
edmontonoilers,lxog18v,2024-11-17 19:25:26,Scotty Bowman would have popped a handful of ice into his mouth and quietly seethed while Bouchard found a cozy spot on the bench opening the gate the rest of the game.
edmontonoilers,lxlf1rm,2024-11-17 09:15:48,Fingers crossed the blood was just from a cut above his eye and it's nothing serious and he is ok. Let him take as much time as he needs to fully recover.Putting good vibes out Into the universe for him.
edmontonoilers,lxli7wj,2024-11-17 09:37:01,Him or Ekholm are truly the worst hit this team could take. We have the offensive firepower to somewhat compensate if Drai or Mcdavid are out but the D is so weak losing either of them for a couple of weeks would be pretty terrible. Both of them eat so many minutes nobody else can
edmontonoilers,lxlqnuv,2024-11-17 10:28:49,Also wasted 5 min PP.
edmontonoilers,lxlldio,2024-11-17 09:57:08,Amen. We the Oilers Diaspora of Ontario (ODO) will suffer on Monday
edmontonoilers,lxln13b,2024-11-17 10:07:10,Gods speed to you
edmontonoilers,lxmikyv,2024-11-17 13:04:27,No update yet probably waiting for the swelling to go down to see if it’s just concussion or he broke something. Jack said he was joking around with the trainers in the locker room so that’s a good sign he said it’s not long term in his opinion.
edmontonoilers,lxm8g76,2024-11-17 12:08:20,He was apparently joking with the trainers during / after the game (as per Elliott Friedman Twitter) so his injury at least shouldn't be severe.
edmontonoilers,lxlrykg,2024-11-17 10:36:24,Probably won't know anything until Knoblauch's presser after morning skate tomorrow.
edmontonoilers,lxnafj8,2024-11-17 15:32:48,I’ve heard that Stu hires Smith’s old coach in the off season (not sure how true that is). If it’s true that’s an indicator that we desperately need a goalie coaching change like several years ago…
edmontonoilers,lxlsf0y,2024-11-17 10:39:01,Apparently Reaves went to the Oilers dressing room to apologize fwiw
edmontonoilers,lxn277d,2024-11-17 14:48:10,Hyman was very quite too.
edmontonoilers,lxmmi0x,2024-11-17 13:25:29,Daddy effect can go the other way.
edmontonoilers,lxmr0e7,2024-11-17 13:48:52,He’s been terrible by every measure. His craptitude is overshadowed by consistently bad performances by Bouchard and Skinner running on two flat tires.
edmontonoilers,lxp3xau,2024-11-17 21:50:52,It will cost more than our imaginary cap space will allow.
edmontonoilers,lxputrj,2024-11-18 01:10:19,This has never changed 
edmontonoilers,lxp4kqk,2024-11-17 21:54:57,I don’t want any playing.  Extra rest
edmontonoilers,lxoylmg,2024-11-17 21:17:52,This is a good thing. Rest up for the playoffs
edmontonoilers,lxlt60m,2024-11-17 10:43:18,Yeah 7 of their last 8 points and they lost because of errors that can be fixed vs being a bad team.
edmontonoilers,lxlwf5z,2024-11-17 11:02:01,The oilers will get it together and make the playoffs but there is no universe where we win a chip with skinner unless its a blue moon on friday the 13th where all the planets align
edmontonoilers,lxn1sjl,2024-11-17 14:45:56,I thought it was an evenly played game but Leafs defence and goaltending was far superior.
edmontonoilers,lxlvrg9,2024-11-17 10:58:13,But but we're still winning the cup!!!! Just ignore our glaring issues and we'll be fine
edmontonoilers,lxmuiq3,2024-11-17 14:07:06,I think the boys were rattled after the Nurse hit felt like it took the wind right out of their sails
edmontonoilers,lxmyjsa,2024-11-17 14:28:19,Just as important as killing off a 2 man advantage
edmontonoilers,lxleww0,2024-11-17 09:14:53,Should re-sign him now while his stock is plummeting.
edmontonoilers,lxlwqx9,2024-11-17 11:03:48,"I think a bigger discussion needs to be made about Skinner. Campbell for some reason was a simpler decision went to second goaltender and then minors and then buyout. At some point something has to be done. At least bench him to #2 for Pickard for the time being.Like Bouchard I think the lack of A level prospects especially in goal and defence make any decision difficult especially with Bouchard's offence. There still remains an arrogance in the organization that suggests that they don't sit the ""stars"" and there remains a worry that if we hurt their feelings they will ask to be traded."
edmontonoilers,lxlhdro,2024-11-17 09:31:32,I'm with you. I love Skinner and would be sad to see him traded but it's looking more and more necessary... Still that would definitely ruin the teams energy interpersonally i bet. Also look at Ullmark on the sens. I was pumped for that but so far not making a huge impact.
edmontonoilers,lxlxkwx,2024-11-17 11:08:27,Need to start Ekholm on the OT1 and not Bouch. We would have won the game if that was the move.
edmontonoilers,lxluh1h,2024-11-17 10:50:48,Arvy being a righty should definitely be given an extended look on the top unit. One timers from all directions available.
edmontonoilers,lxluixt,2024-11-17 10:51:07,Like injured arvy?
edmontonoilers,lxlxwzi,2024-11-17 11:10:17,Skinner shouldn't have even need signed. Could have had broberg instead. 
edmontonoilers,lxm9p3p,2024-11-17 12:15:18,Definition of insanity. This team has the exact same problems every year you and other fans expecting a cup to fall in the oilers laps regardless is insanity.
edmontonoilers,lxncah5,2024-11-17 15:42:56,Ma’am this is Reddit get your positivity out of here
edmontonoilers,lxnrdyv,2024-11-17 17:03:59,That was two seasons ago. But we got blown out in Toronto last year too (6-3).
edmontonoilers,lxnz4ot,2024-11-17 17:47:21,Yeah I'm not I'm the mood to be negative. We have got a great team the good parts are good and I trust them to work.oit the bad parts.
edmontonoilers,lxmk8yr,2024-11-17 13:13:29,I don’t think anyone cares if a goalie is homegrown or not. We just want a goalie who can make a save
edmontonoilers,lxmxv50,2024-11-17 14:24:37,No all the stats say he sucks.  He can prove us wrong by not being last in soem categories in the whole fucking league.
edmontonoilers,lxmwrz7,2024-11-17 14:18:53,Who gives a fuck where he’s from. He didn’t have great numbers in the playoffs either and at one point was replaced with a AHL goalie. So you say we shouldn’t judge him after a rough start to the season but we should judge him by another small selection of games when he was good? You can’t have it both ways. Also we’re 2 games away from a quarter of the way through the season. We’re past bad start.
edmontonoilers,lxmmz8q,2024-11-17 13:28:02,And I will never forget that 2-1 goal in game 7.An absolute muffin from above the circles goes in low glove and we lose the stanley cup.I like Stu he seems like an awesome guy. However I think we've seen enough now to know he has 0 clutch.Anyone bitching about defensive breakdowns isn't looking at the whole picture. This team has been doing a fantastic job at limiting chances and shots - all fucking year.Breakdowns happen to every team and good teams have a tendy to make a save when that happens.We almost NEVER get a big save.
edmontonoilers,lxmwfrg,2024-11-17 14:17:07,We made it to the finals despite him not because of him 
edmontonoilers,lxm88q4,2024-11-17 12:07:11,As an Angels baseball fan I can see this lol
edmontonoilers,lxmxbvk,2024-11-17 14:21:47,I would gladly take you up on that bet. You have 0 stats on your side and all the stats point to Skinner being the biggest issue by far 
edmontonoilers,lxm0637,2024-11-17 11:22:48,A trade won’t fix his snail-like lateral movement or weak glove hand or complete lack of any clutch moments.
edmontonoilers,lxlpvw6,2024-11-17 10:24:15,Not a single draft pick under Holland has panned out. Broberg and Holloway will likely be the only full time NHL’ers.
edmontonoilers,lxlz8k3,2024-11-17 11:17:39,People are still on the Wallstedt thing?The Oilers are in **win now** mode. Wallstedt has three games played in the NHL since 2021 with a sub .900 save percentage.I'm really not sure how that helps us.
edmontonoilers,lxm4mb0,2024-11-17 11:47:11,Husso's available 
edmontonoilers,lxpye7x,2024-11-18 01:44:25,Seattle lost as well (they are right on our heels in the standings)
edmontonoilers,lxmzrah,2024-11-17 14:34:48,Believe it or not but the whole team was sent straight to jail.
edmontonoilers,lxndfu9,2024-11-17 15:48:50,Yeah it’s pretty bad. We actually suck so much that Draisaitl terminated his 8 year contract and demanded a trade to Toronto McDavid is refusing to re sign so I think he’ll join Drai as well. Ekholm retired early which stressed out Bouchard and made him age another 20 years so he’s done as well. Now our D core is in shambles and Nurse is demanding a $16M x 8 contract to stay with the team. Go back to work
edmontonoilers,lxlzy81,2024-11-17 11:21:36,Yeah I'm not digging the new additions and I miss those guys. Hopefully they gel and produce a bit more as the season goes on.
edmontonoilers,lxninsa,2024-11-17 16:16:08,I feel like last year skinner needed to play 10-12 games in a row. The first couple wereAlways soft and he would start to heat up. They seem like they are trying to rest him more often this year and not giving him a chance to get rolling.
edmontonoilers,lxna98r,2024-11-17 15:31:50,Which is why the goalie coach Dustin Schwartz needs to be fired *immediately*! The average fan shouldn’t know the goalie coach’s name that’s far too deep down the rabbit hole. But because Schwartz has ruined every single goalie this team has had for the past decade his is a household name. Ugh! I love Stu and he is being done a huge disservice by the coaching.
edmontonoilers,lxm0mln,2024-11-17 11:25:18,Mike Smith would casually skate to that puck and toedrag the forechecking Leaf before making a stretch pass to 97. Jokes aside I have NO clue why Skinner didn’t go for it.

edmontonoilers,lxm49sv,2024-11-17 11:45:18,Thanks for stopping by
edmontonoilers,lxmhsmm,2024-11-17 13:00:09,"Leafs goalie made a bunch of ""point blank"" saves including stopping McDavid in OT.  Youre absolutely correct about Bouchard.  Unforgivable defence.  But the sample size for Skinner is growing"
edmontonoilers,lxmadne,2024-11-17 12:19:07,The Leafs had 7 shots in the 3rd and OT and 3 went in. Stu needs to make a save and was an absolute pylon on the 3rd and OT goals. Bouch messed up bad on both and so did Skinner. Also we see the opposing goalies face point blank shots from us every game and they make saves.
edmontonoilers,lxmzfeu,2024-11-17 14:33:05,That OT goal was a terrible one to let in. But Bouch is definitely why it got to OT.
edmontonoilers,lxm9se2,2024-11-17 12:15:49,If we had an elite goalie we almost certainly would have won that game. It’s that simple. Mitch marner should not have been able to score the goal in OT.
edmontonoilers,lxmrktz,2024-11-17 13:51:53,Fucking nonsense mate.Yes Bouchard is making huge bloopers every night. But to say that Skinner is only facing high danger shots is ridiculous. He’s dead last in the legaue in expected Goals against. Dead last. 54th in Sv% and 57th in GAA. He lets in every kind of goal there is right now.
edmontonoilers,lxma1ca,2024-11-17 12:17:14,Swap the goalies and we win.
edmontonoilers,lxm836e,2024-11-17 12:06:20,"I feel like our weak D's play more for Picks. They hang Skinner out to fucking dry. Skinner is 100% not an ""elite goalie"" but they hardly have elite defense in front of him."
edmontonoilers,lxm8xqk,2024-11-17 12:11:04,I would also point out the injury to nurse put us at 5 d for the remainder of the game hobbling the rest that the already less then perfect d would get.
edmontonoilers,lxlyvw2,2024-11-17 11:15:40,I don’t disagree. I like him as a guy but I hate him as a goalie. He’s just not consistent to any degree
edmontonoilers,lxndh0o,2024-11-17 15:49:00,The Oilers are 9-4-2 after a 0-3 start. I think they’ll be fine lol.
edmontonoilers,lxp05sj,2024-11-17 21:27:33,Lol we're 9-7-2. Long way away from 5-12-1. This team won't even be recognizable in March.
edmontonoilers,lxnbq65,2024-11-17 15:39:54,I was expecting one of the Oilers to come out with a big fight and pound the Leafs. There was definitely concern and worry on the Oilers’ faces but a low key response for sure. Especially with that five minute major I thought the Oilers would make the Leafs pay.
edmontonoilers,lxmarmm,2024-11-17 12:21:18,Is this in response to losing Broberg or something else?
edmontonoilers,lxn8cje,2024-11-17 15:21:38,you want to trade bouch and nuge??
edmontonoilers,lxmgorq,2024-11-17 12:54:06,I can’t imagine having to pay Bouch 10 million but that’s probably what he would get if he goes to market. This team needs a goalie that can steal some games for them.
edmontonoilers,lxoxnyu,2024-11-17 21:12:08,Trading Hyman for a stint of bad play is bonkers
edmontonoilers,lxp5jo9,2024-11-17 22:01:09,Agreed on the need for a defenseman but we likely won’t see that move until the deadline. There’s no particular rush and we want to accumulate cap.My thoughts are pretty simple on the Hyman take - you don’t under any circumstance trade Hyman. We could write a novel here on the reasons why. But I’ll just highlight that yes he scored 50 last year and it’s not as if that ability has just disappeared he’s fifth in current expected goals for he’s in the 97th percentile across the NHL for o-zone possession time and is a character player on and off the ice for the Oilers. I find it hard to see how his “stock is low” … as a 50 goal scorer who was a centrepiece of a game 7 cup run only last year.
edmontonoilers,lxp4raq,2024-11-17 21:56:07,Hyman will never hit 50 again but he will do 35 plus still.
edmontonoilers,lxokngz,2024-11-17 19:52:21,Or Nuge?
edmontonoilers,lxmhwer,2024-11-17 13:00:45,I don’t think they said exactly what’s going on but sort of implied illness. They did think short term
edmontonoilers,lxmhnk2,2024-11-17 12:59:23,I believe he is sick
edmontonoilers,lxlvijm,2024-11-17 10:56:48,Bouchard skated towards the bench with more effort than he did trying to chase down the leafs player.
edmontonoilers,lxmk71p,2024-11-17 13:13:12,People legitimately saying to trade Bouchard are insane.  Or my all time favourite is trade for a star goalie this isn’t a video game.  You can’t just add picks until they accept
edmontonoilers,lxmxudn,2024-11-17 14:24:30,Why did you just 11 games when the default is last 10 games? Is it because 7-3-1 looks better than 6-3-1 so it fits your argument  better?
edmontonoilers,lxmqt0t,2024-11-17 13:47:47,they've been better but the way we lost the leafs is a huge tilter can't imagine what the locker room was like.
edmontonoilers,lxlv8q3,2024-11-17 10:55:13,The only way they can accrue salary is by running a 21 man roster and being $1M under the cap. That will get them around $4M in deadline space. Kane is currently counting against the cap so they don't get any extra space from him being out unless they wait until the deadline to put him on LTIR. If they do that knowing he's it until the playoffs they will have the $4M they accrued plus $5M in LTIR room
edmontonoilers,lxlfay4,2024-11-17 09:17:34,I’m guessing the blood is not as serious as the very obvious concussion
edmontonoilers,lxlfggo,2024-11-17 09:18:36,The blood on the eye had me worried but I seen where it came from afterwards. It’s not there getting up but is there just as camera cuts or view blocked. It dripped from the visor you can see it on slomo.
edmontonoilers,lxm5mx3,2024-11-17 11:52:46,Scored on the pp too tho
edmontonoilers,lxnrn7g,2024-11-17 17:05:23,Its not really true. Smith and Skinner use the same personal trainer for conditioning and stuff like that not an independent goaltending coach. Stu has always been a Schwartz guy even in the offseason. Him Tristan Jarry and formerly Carter Fart all train with Schwartz in the summer (and all coincidentally seem to suck at similar things lmao). That said we do need a change in that department. Even if Schwartz was merely middling at his job 9 years is a fucking absurd tenure for any sort of NHL coach outside of a truly outstanding one and the fact that he’s personally outlived god knows how many coaching staffs on the team is nuts. Its time to get some fresh perspectives and maybe Stu will continue to grow as he is pretty good at some things but backbreakingly terrible at others and is showing no signs of growth in those areas. He seems to have reached his ceiling in the current setup.
edmontonoilers,lxnqutf,2024-11-17 17:00:59,It’s a conditioning coach. Not a goalie coach.
edmontonoilers,lxluqgx,2024-11-17 10:52:18,I can believe if it was unintentional because of how fast things happen on the ice. Still reckless and dangerous.
edmontonoilers,lxlveow,2024-11-17 10:56:12,Whoopity fucking do
edmontonoilers,lxlxkdl,2024-11-17 11:08:22,Great; who the fuck cares.  Don’t throw the hit next time.  We’re out a top d man for at least a bit now.
edmontonoilers,lxluqy6,2024-11-17 10:52:22,I didn't watch the game. What was the response? Did anyone target Stolarz/Tavares/Nylander?
edmontonoilers,lxp5ui7,2024-11-17 22:03:06,Move Skinner J as well as Skinner S.   Boom.  Problem solved
edmontonoilers,lxp0zk7,2024-11-17 21:32:45,Yeah I’m sure these guys would be pissed to represent their country
edmontonoilers,lxm8hi2,2024-11-17 12:08:32,You cant fix the worst goalie in the NHL.
edmontonoilers,lxoo3xe,2024-11-17 20:13:19,Exactly what I'm thinking. These will get ironed out eventually not saying that they won't ever happen again but will for sure become less frequent as the season progresses
edmontonoilers,lxlf5l9,2024-11-17 09:16:32,Ya like he or his agent would agree
edmontonoilers,lxlf4k7,2024-11-17 09:16:21,Trade him while we still can!
edmontonoilers,lxm8jea,2024-11-17 12:08:49,Bouch would need to have so many more points than he does currently to balance his defense 
edmontonoilers,lxm1x9x,2024-11-17 11:32:23,Campbell was an easy decision because no one was going to pick him up on waivers. Skinner was in his sophomore year and would have been snapped up would actually have gotten to play as a backup like he was supposed to and probably would be killing it now.  And we would have been left with Campbell and Pickard. I am not sold on getting rid of Skinner but he needs to sit a bit and get rid of whatever monkey is on his back.And the goalie coach desperately needs to be turfed.
edmontonoilers,lxm36wn,2024-11-17 11:39:22,Skinner is a back up goalie at best We need a starter.
edmontonoilers,lxljqff,2024-11-17 09:46:50,I don't see them trading Skinner unless a genuine starter was available through trade. Feels more likely that management would trade/waive Picks and acquire someone else to share the net the net with Stu. Blackwood could be an affordable option as far as cap-hit is related although I don't know what that trade cost would be. Not saying this is the right play just a gut feeling.There's also the mystery box that is Rodrigue. But still more than likely a season too early for him.
edmontonoilers,lxlustz,2024-11-17 10:52:41,
edmontonoilers,lxmlkc9,2024-11-17 13:20:28,Yeah first I’m hearing about a goalie being homegrown. I just want somebody to make some saves.
edmontonoilers,lxnc36w,2024-11-17 15:41:50,Stu had a couple of bad games against Vancouver otherwise he actually had really solid playoff run that included outplaying Jake Oettinger for a series
edmontonoilers,lxm2tsf,2024-11-17 11:37:21,“Lack of clutch moments”  game 4-5 Dallas game 5 FLA game 6 VAN game 3/4 LA.
edmontonoilers,lxlxw20,2024-11-17 11:10:08,Even then they are just ok.  He missed on every single draft somehow.
edmontonoilers,lxlt3l1,2024-11-17 10:42:55,Holland is a shit GM
edmontonoilers,lxmarol,2024-11-17 12:21:19,Both skinners have been bad…. I really hope the new signings pick it up.
edmontonoilers,lxm16r1,2024-11-17 11:28:21,I have no doubt Mike Smith would have come out of his crease for sure haha.Perhaps it’s a confidence thing? As in Skinner’s current confidence level isn’t high and so he judged this to be a risky move?
edmontonoilers,lxneooh,2024-11-17 15:55:20,He did and he was better than Stu for sure. But we are probably not going to have an elite goalie all of the money is tied up in the forwards unless the oilers make a trade. They have to make it work with a mid tier goalie. I don't think that is Skinner he's not good enough to be a starter. But my point is that even with a BETTER goalie than Skinner this team is going to still have real trouble beating the elite clubs in the playoffs. The defense specifically Bouchard are making some of the dumbest decisions possible rn and it's costing the team games.
edmontonoilers,lxmd59j,2024-11-17 12:34:30,I hate watching just knowing that the puck is going in. I’ve never watched an NHL team that you can just feel the goals against so much for. Like oh need a big save in the 3rd and it’s a 2 on 1? You just know it’s going in before they even get into the zone. I’m sure the team can feel it too.
edmontonoilers,lxng3hd,2024-11-17 16:02:24,Again the 3 shots were a turnover in the empty slot a breakaway then a 2 on 1. The opposing goalies are better than Skinner and I hope he gets benched for Pickard. But we aren't beating any of the good teams in the league with a 3rd period like that. The opposing goalies are better than ours and we should be expecting that most nights. All of the oilers money is locked into scoring as many goals as they can and trying to minimize team mistakes. They are scoring the goals now but the mistakes are killing them.
edmontonoilers,lxncm1l,2024-11-17 15:44:35,Last night he let in goals on a giveaway right to the slot a breakaway then a 2 on 1. He's not a great goalie at all and I don't think he should be a starter. The point is that even if we could trade Skinner rn and get a better goalie  the oilers are still going to have lots of problems. Too many giveaways turnovers odd man rushes. Penalty kill is getting better but still horrendous.
edmontonoilers,lxmrxb6,2024-11-17 13:53:42,How many nights has that been the case. Most of the losses. Vegas Carolina and Toronto for sure. Take it further. In half the wins if the goalies were swapped we would have won by 4-6 goals.
edmontonoilers,lxm95sp,2024-11-17 12:12:20,There are goalies with far superior stats to Skinner right now that have even worse defenses than ours that give up more scoring chances.
edmontonoilers,lxmbfme,2024-11-17 12:24:57,We dressed 7 defenseman actually because Arvidsson was out although I can see why you'd say 5 considering Bouch was negative defense for us this game. 
edmontonoilers,lxnobbz,2024-11-17 16:47:07,This may be true but they’re also 2-5-2 against teams in a playoff spot.
edmontonoilers,lxmx4ah,2024-11-17 14:20:42,Can't a person make a random comment?
edmontonoilers,lxo2d4t,2024-11-17 18:05:53,I know sounds crazy but option wise it’s what we have that could bring a serious return.  We can’t afford Bouch’s new contract so I say move him for something good.  Don’t really want to trade Nuge but we’d get something for him….
edmontonoilers,lxo2k7x,2024-11-17 18:07:01,Yes…AND a true first pairing defenceman.
edmontonoilers,lxp2b19,2024-11-17 21:40:54,Even if it gets us a 1D or 2D defender? Just an idea he will be lucky to hit 20goals at his current pace and I think alot of teams would give up quite a bit to get him. But if it's just a horribly bad stretch for him and he goes back to being a 50 goals scorer that would hurt
edmontonoilers,lxp7jyv,2024-11-17 22:14:09,As of this moment he only has 3 goals I mean his stock is low because of that stat alone.If he had 10 goals or something we wouldn't even be having this conversation...but the sample size is very small. It would be a super risky move to trade him especially if he went off on another team and starts scoring again. I'm just trying to figure out how the oilers improve on defense and goaltending while keeping the offense going. So far they have been scoring just fine and Hyman has not been contributing so it's an idea.
edmontonoilers,lxoovkm,2024-11-17 20:18:02,Ya him as well. I just didn't think we would get as much for him so it might not be worth it
edmontonoilers,lxo5raq,2024-11-17 18:25:48,Beyond other teams not wanting to trade their elite D and goalies they fail to realize Skinner and Bouch are on good contracts too. Trade them for who exactly? The league isn’t exactly overflowing with top D and starting goalies with a combined 6.5 cap hit.
edmontonoilers,lxn0ft3,2024-11-17 14:38:30,I mean it was just to show that they’ve been consistently winning recently. There’s not really a huge difference between 0.65 and 0.68 both stats serve my argument just fine.
edmontonoilers,lxmvy1z,2024-11-17 14:14:31,I don’t know we have a horrible record against the leafs in their building.  After last year I don’t think they are taking the regular season as seriously.  It seems every game is just practice and warm up for the playoffs.    There was a lot of good in this game and like 8 minutes of bad. 4 of 5 we play that way we win
edmontonoilers,lxlg91u,2024-11-17 09:23:58,Yeah people are saying it's just a cut from the visor.That concussion looked nasty he was out of it. That's why he needs to take as long as he needs to fully recover as concussions can (rightly so) be career ending these days.
edmontonoilers,lxlfykw,2024-11-17 09:22:02,Ah brilliant I haven't seen the slomo. Glad it doesn't look too bad.
edmontonoilers,lxmblf4,2024-11-17 12:25:52,On one. But the 5 min PP we got was awful. 2 shots…
edmontonoilers,lxnrxlj,2024-11-17 17:06:59,I stand corrected thanks for clarifying!
edmontonoilers,lxnrz3a,2024-11-17 17:07:13,I stand corrected thanks for clarifying!
edmontonoilers,lxm0vyo,2024-11-17 11:26:44,The response should have been 1-2 goals on the 5 min PP but they got nada.
edmontonoilers,lxm0gau,2024-11-17 11:24:21,No. There was no response.
edmontonoilers,lxprfc5,2024-11-18 00:39:27,Good. Take it out on every one else post break.
edmontonoilers,lxlfeui,2024-11-17 09:18:18,They absolutely would not haha. But if he keeps this shit up all year he will have cost himself so much on his contract. Better for us in the long run.
edmontonoilers,lxm2dff,2024-11-17 11:34:51,Brain dead we should try to resign him asap for 8 mill his agent will never agree but it’s worth a shot before he figures it out just like last season.
edmontonoilers,lxm80tw,2024-11-17 12:05:58,With his current play he's not even backup goalie caliber. He's AHL caliber.
edmontonoilers,lxllwob,2024-11-17 10:00:24,At this point I like the look of a mystery box.
edmontonoilers,lxlxu6t,2024-11-17 11:09:52,Yeah I don't think they ever would trade him either. I don't even know that I would want them to even though his performance has been meh so far. Still can't forget his finals performance.
edmontonoilers,lxlnvdi,2024-11-17 10:12:16,Blackwood would be my choice.
edmontonoilers,lxmqayy,2024-11-17 13:45:11,Reddit Straw Man 101.“You all are saying X….” when nobody actually is.This is the weapon of first resort for ‘smrter than U’ basement dwelling fingernail farmers.
edmontonoilers,lxm74mf,2024-11-17 12:01:01,Those werent clutch moments it was him being a normal fucking goaltender lmfao. Are you forgetting the SOFT as fuck cup winning goal? The save we absolutely fucking NEEDED? Hes the worst goaltender in the NHL and our stars carried his trash ass to game 7
edmontonoilers,lxob31f,2024-11-17 18:57:03,Tyler Wright is bad for 4 of the 5 years the oilers were dead last in the league in GF% when Leon or Connor weren’t on the ice. Those two generational players scoring at a pace not seen in 30 years covered up a lot.
edmontonoilers,lxob4c2,2024-11-17 18:57:16,Yep
edmontonoilers,lxm26tg,2024-11-17 11:33:51,Yea I think his confidence is a train wreck right now. We should remember he is not usually this bad. I mean he had above .900 SV% in both his seasons and now he seems like he couldn’t save a baby drowning in a bath tub
edmontonoilers,lxngsql,2024-11-17 16:06:04, It's like a balloon that gets bigger and bigger and all of a sudden pops. One bad goal or mistake and the confidence seems to just vanish from the whole team. Also not scoring in the 5min power play gave me a really bad feeling for the game in general
edmontonoilers,lxnjmvn,2024-11-17 16:21:31,That's going to be the case almost EVERY night! Most of those teams paid money for a good starting goalie... Of course we would crush with Adin Hill Helleybuck Bobrovsky. We are never going to have a goalie like that as long as Drai and Connor are playing together not enough cap space. But I want to see Skinner gone for sure just don't know if Pickard can win it all for them either though
edmontonoilers,lxmbwmg,2024-11-17 12:27:36,Skinner dickriders ignore this. A normal NHL goalie makes saves.
edmontonoilers,lxmuc7h,2024-11-17 14:06:11,My mistakeyou are correct.https://www.gamedaytweets.com/lines?team=EDM
edmontonoilers,lxqr75r,2024-11-18 06:51:00,Because skinner cant hold a fucking lead is why 2-5-2
edmontonoilers,lxr5sbn,2024-11-18 08:42:00,Hyman is not getting a 1D. What team had a 1D and would trade them for not futures but a 32 year old winger.
edmontonoilers,lxpm2jw,2024-11-17 23:55:39,horribly bad stretch isn’t the way to put it. is he playing to the caliber he can? no. is this a “horribly bad stretch”? also no. you don’t even think of trading a guy who’s been this good for our team at good value until you get an actual good sample size. earliest you should even think of it is TDL. there are multiple players in the roster not fully bought in and some growing pains. once this team finds their game and starts churning out wins if he’s still a weak link and we need the defense sure. but jumping the gun to trade him would be a horrible idea.
edmontonoilers,lxop5ac,2024-11-17 20:19:40,I totally agree with a shake up.  I mean we cant fire the coach every year.     Can we?   Can we????
edmontonoilers,lxnm7l9,2024-11-17 16:35:38,I'll take a goal every 7 mins of pp. Especially since a 5 minute pp is NOT as valuable as 2.5 2 minute pp
edmontonoilers,lxnsztw,2024-11-17 17:12:50,It’s a common piece of misinformation that gets spread around the fandom. Smith used Schwartz as the goalie coach when he was in Edmonton but he had his own conditioning coach (as we know he was pretty ripped lol).
edmontonoilers,lxmbtto,2024-11-17 12:27:10,That's an overpay
edmontonoilers,lxm98i1,2024-11-17 12:12:43,Either Nurse or bouchard won't be on this roster next fall watch!
edmontonoilers,lxlucso,2024-11-17 10:50:08,Blackwood is fucking horrid
edmontonoilers,lxm9s2z,2024-11-17 12:15:46,What about the rest of the team not scoring clutch goals when we needed them?
edmontonoilers,lxpyl1l,2024-11-18 01:46:17,Not to mention that he has a NMC. As does nuge.
edmontonoilers,lxqojrn,2024-11-18 06:26:31,"I get the value part he's a really good price for Edmonton. But I do think we are at a point in the season where you can call it a ""stretch"" a quarter of the season is over now. He is on pace for 12 goals. The team has been churning out wins they were on a roll. He didn't produce at all in this stretch and Edmonton was still winning. I do think that the sample size is still too low and it would be hasty to trade him just yet. But my point is that if a great deal comes along and he's willing to move the oilers really need to think hard about it now. They proved they can score without him and maybe you get a top tier defenseman in exchange or a starting goalie."
edmontonoilers,lxoq1hu,2024-11-17 20:25:10,Lol we can but should we? Should we??
edmontonoilers,lxmlt7g,2024-11-17 13:21:49,Huh  the guy is 3rd in points for a defenseman in a playoffs ever. Nobody in the playoffs had more high danger chances for than Bouchard (109 vs 93 in second place) he also had 3 more high danger chances against then Tanev while playing 105 MORE minutes. This sub has a memory of a goldfish lmfao.
edmontonoilers,lxs6nu8,2024-11-18 12:08:44,it’s still a bad time to consider that. the stretch shouldn’t be the deciding factor in a player who has been good for SEASONS. this isn’t a good enough stretch because a quarter of a season shouldn’t dictate that. also the oilers have only been “on a roll” for around 5 weeks.they were really inconsistent to start the season. the point here is: there are multiple players on the team not performing how they should be. we have a total of only 2 ppg players. compare hyman to the rest of the forwards in the lineup not named mcdavid and drai and he’s doing better than them.he’s also not anywhere near worth a top tier defenseman. risking trading a guy who’s important to the core and chemistry of the team for a defenseman who wouldn’t be good enough to fix all our defensive lapses and might struggle more under our system doesn’t make sense. if he’s still in a slump during TDL that’s when it would be easiest to make a trade because everyone has more clarity. trading right now would be the worst possible time to do so and there is no part of hyman that would want to go against his NMC. if anything it would mess up morale for a player who’s been good for us for seasons to be seen as someone to move after less than 20 games.
edmontonoilers,lxoq7sv,2024-11-17 20:26:15,Lol.  Oh these comedic interludes are good for the soul after last night's collapse
edmontonoilers,lxsrvjp,2024-11-18 13:55:04,Ya you make some good points there the morale would definitely be screwed up if Hyman leaves and I think you are right on by seeing we would never get a top tier defenseman for him at least at the rate he is scoring now. I guess we ride it out until the deadline and see how the season is going then
edmontonoilers,lxoqcc2,2024-11-17 20:27:00,If u don't laugh you cry
edmontonoilers,lxss6xd,2024-11-18 13:56:38,agreed but i do agree it would help to have an upgrade either on D or in net
edmontonoilers,lxoqp7s,2024-11-17 20:29:12,Indubitably
edmontonoilers,lxssegc,2024-11-18 13:57:39,Yes but the question is how? We have no real players of value to trade and the ones we do have we don't want to let go of. Maybe once we accrue more cap space they can make a few deals
edmontonoilers,lxjteou,2024-11-17 00:07:03,Not every thought needs to be a post
edmontonoilers,lxjtv0m,2024-11-17 00:10:50,blame management not Stu.We were 2 goals away from the cup regardless
edmontonoilers,lxju8ns,2024-11-17 00:14:00,54th in Sv% 77th in xGA. He’s an NHL goalie but not a very good one statistically. He’s never been better than average through his career and his numbers are way way way down this season 1/4 of the way through. Not good enough.
edmontonoilers,lxl64al,2024-11-17 08:10:45,Look I’m not piling on the Skinner hate train but objectively saying it’s true. Dude just doesn’t have what it takes. I wish he did because he’s a great teammate but he’s soft when it matters. We will never make it back to a cup final with Stu - that’s just reality.
edmontonoilers,lxju8pj,2024-11-17 00:14:01,Based off every game except the pits game I 100% agree
edmontonoilers,lxk9bvo,2024-11-17 02:30:15,Red wings won with osgood avs with kuemper pens with Matt Murray..
edmontonoilers,lxjtsqk,2024-11-17 00:10:17,Yet he almost won cup
edmontonoilers,lxka1ye,2024-11-17 02:38:01,Oilers have the best player in history. The second best player in the NHL. And y’all want the bobrovsky too. Can’t have it all. We would have won the cup last year if we scored more than a goal
edmontonoilers,lxk04vy,2024-11-17 01:02:44,Same thing was said last year. Guy has ups and downs. Gets pulls in 2nd round bounced back and put up some great numbers especially in elimination games. His mentality and striving to be better is his saving grace and he’s very open about it. Over the last 10 years I’ve seen nothing but shit on goalies. This guy is a local kid and is a fighter and doesn’t quit. Every goalie has bad games and if he didn’t bounce back the way he has and tries to fix those mistakes I’d agree with you however that’s not the case. Even if he ever wins a cup people are still going to shit on him. It’s an endless cycle.
edmontonoilers,lxtxl5z,2024-11-18 17:27:01,Anybody disagreeing with you would make a horrid general manager
edmontonoilers,lxjtwit,2024-11-17 00:11:11,OP sober up and log off for 24h
edmontonoilers,lxjwn80,2024-11-17 00:34:03,I think pickard is a better choice. Not amazing but definitely more consistent than stu… unfortunately it sucks but that’s just how it has to be
edmontonoilers,lxjti57,2024-11-17 00:07:49,You are correct but this one does..
edmontonoilers,lxkka6b,2024-11-17 04:30:23,
edmontonoilers,lxjzol0,2024-11-17 00:58:51,Everyone wants to feel special.
edmontonoilers,lxlwbt4,2024-11-17 11:01:28,This is the most tired statement they had an extremely lucky run. Statistically they had one of the worst playoff performances from a defence standpoint and the goaltending was also mediocre at best.  You are not going to have that level of luck two years in a row they need a significantly better goalie or they need a significantly better defensive core.  Skinner is positionally one of the worst starting goalies I’ve seen. He plays big that works in the slower paced minor leagues his lack of agility is being exploited in the NHL.
edmontonoilers,lxjue6y,2024-11-17 00:15:15,Agree 100%
edmontonoilers,lxl6lxi,2024-11-17 08:14:37,Ya I just hate that he’s not good at the moment because he seems like a great guy. He’s still young though so maybe he figures it out.
edmontonoilers,lxju0z5,2024-11-17 00:12:14,“He”
edmontonoilers,lxju6yw,2024-11-17 00:13:37,Sadly that is the past
edmontonoilers,lxjuc3p,2024-11-17 00:14:46,No idea what this means
edmontonoilers,lxlq8kx,2024-11-17 10:26:19,lol Pickard is definitely not a better choice than Stu.
edmontonoilers,lxju10s,2024-11-17 00:12:14,You didn’t reply to the guy
edmontonoilers,lxkcpw2,2024-11-17 03:06:34,Participation trophy generation
edmontonoilers,lxnnteg,2024-11-17 16:44:24,Show your work
edmontonoilers,lxjv5eo,2024-11-17 00:21:32,He’s actually worse than Koskinen was in his third full season. Koskinen was .903 with a 3.03 Sv%Skinner is .877 with a 3.38. Yikes.
edmontonoilers,lxjuaz1,2024-11-17 00:14:31,Hockey is a solo sport you didn’t know?

coloradoavalanche,lxtpmx0,2024-11-18 16:45:31,You can see the Set 1 sticker. Tbh you can go on Sideline Swap and pick up a bunch of skates like this that are game worn. Takes the novelty away if I’m honest.

coloradoavalanche,lxsu5h8,2024-11-18 14:06:28,Just a reminder that the only player on the Flyers roster with a Stanley Cup is former Av Erik Johnson

coloradoavalanche,lxsirpj,2024-11-18 13:09:26,lol cheer loud for EJ when he gets the puck if you’re going to the game!!
coloradoavalanche,lxt813b,2024-11-18 15:16:39,Avs are 1st in shots against (meaning they allow the fewest shots against in the league) but 30th in goals against. I don’t care who does it but we need to start getting some saves.

coloradoavalanche,lxtrzzp,2024-11-18 16:57:29,I wonder where we rank on giving up high danger shots.  It seems like we don't allow a lot of shots and draw a lot of penalties which help this stat but the shots we do give up are ones that are really hard to save.  I don't think that stat alone really gives the full picture.But yes I'd love to see some shutouts this season.
coloradoavalanche,lxsp1rt,2024-11-18 13:40:59,Lived on the east coast for a year and the time of sports games was the absolutely worst. I feel your pain and don’t miss it one bit lol.

coloradoavalanche,lxrsas1,2024-11-18 10:54:30,Hell yeah! Definitely going! It would be super cool to get an expansion team here. Gotta show 'em there's plenty of interest!
coloradoavalanche,lxrqyux,2024-11-18 10:47:27,How exciting!!
coloradoavalanche,lxscbz5,2024-11-18 12:37:15,Yeah hope we get PWHL team
coloradoavalanche,lxsd3ml,2024-11-18 12:41:04,Awesome! I was saying since the PWHL started last year that if they come to Denver I definitely want to see a game!
coloradoavalanche,lxsu9qm,2024-11-18 14:07:03,I'm wondering if this tour is also a test-run to engage with the locals and see what the response and interest is like for Women's Hockey. Personally I think all of these places could field a PWHL team. If this tour goes well I could see other cities getting added to a potential future tour.
coloradoavalanche,lxs15vo,2024-11-18 11:40:50,Love this idea get more cities involved.
coloradoavalanche,lxsvxlr,2024-11-18 14:15:21,Sweet

coloradoavalanche,lxtar1p,2024-11-18 15:30:33,I’m having so much trouble deciding which PWHL team to cheer for. If there was a team in Denver it would be a no-brainer. But until then I’m lostI would cheer for the Victoire but Marie Philip-Poulin is evil and has terrorized the USA women’s team for the past several yearsI would cheer for the Sceptres because of Jesse Compher but I’m not supporting a Toronto teamOttawa has an ugly logoBoston is Boston Minnesota is Minnesota New York is New York. I’ll be damned before I cheer for any of those cities either
coloradoavalanche,lxtgzkm,2024-11-18 16:01:54,Woohoo! I don't live in Denver AND my city is also getting a game
coloradoavalanche,lxtl3vn,2024-11-18 16:22:35,Gotta fill up the arena I want an expansion team!
coloradoavalanche,lxsuej3,2024-11-18 14:07:43,Ahhhh it would be so sick to have a women’s team here!! Thanks for posting this OP
coloradoavalanche,lxtahxq,2024-11-18 15:29:15,This is awesome but I object to Minnesota being considered the home team 
coloradoavalanche,lxrt2r6,2024-11-18 10:58:37,Minnesota????
coloradoavalanche,lxs551i,2024-11-18 12:00:56,Hell yeah! Wish we had a team
coloradoavalanche,lxsw1g7,2024-11-18 14:15:53,I like the decision to have games be out of market. More eyes the better and they're in markets that can support teams if the fans are there.
coloradoavalanche,lxsbdjr,2024-11-18 12:32:28,How do we get the presale?
coloradoavalanche,lxrntic,2024-11-18 10:30:25,Jesse Compher is certainly Avs related since JT helped bring us a cup. 877-GOALS-NOW ext. 2
coloradoavalanche,lxrotuw,2024-11-18 10:35:57,Hell yeah this is exciting I didn't even know so thanks for the info!1st couple weeks of January can be a pain to travel from Kansas but closer to time if the roads aren't closed I'm 100% making the trip.Now to look and see if I'm going to be picking up some Victoire or Frost gear for the occasion.
coloradoavalanche,lxrqspy,2024-11-18 10:46:31,Oh absolutely. I think their jerseys and logo are my favorite out of the 6 anyway so that works out
coloradoavalanche,lxsex33,2024-11-18 12:50:05,Love them but Nicole Hensley is a local girl. She will be in net for Minnesota.
coloradoavalanche,lxs2lt6,2024-11-18 11:48:07,Oui
coloradoavalanche,lxsey2e,2024-11-18 12:50:13,Minnesota Frost goalie Nicole Hensley is a Team USA goalie (as is Maddie Rooney) but Hensley is also from Lakewood! So gonna be cheering her on for sure
coloradoavalanche,lxsetw6,2024-11-18 12:49:38,This is the only way I’d cheer for anything from Minnesota lol especially at ball arena
coloradoavalanche,lxt45qh,2024-11-18 14:56:48,I’m so conflicted 
coloradoavalanche,lxrpexw,2024-11-18 10:39:08,Yes everyone buy tickets but wait until after I buy mine! Don’t wanna get fucked by resale prices lol
coloradoavalanche,lxt1qcn,2024-11-18 14:44:32,Looking online are they sold out already?!
coloradoavalanche,lxsknw2,2024-11-18 13:19:00,"Denver. We want to focus this on being as a pair to NHL (starting out with 6 teams as well!)Personally if Denver got a team I would say ""The Diamonds"" because it has a double meaning of being both Ski and snow like the Avs (Black Diamond) and also a mining/gem theme.Plus Denver Diamonds is great alliteration."

coloradoavalanche,lxsttu6,2024-11-18 14:04:51,Was gonna say this - everyone better be cheering for Nicole she’s amazing. Met her a couple years ago and she let my kiddos hold her Olympic medal.*edit: a word
coloradoavalanche,lxsjh05,2024-11-18 13:13:00,Would it be bullying if we go in Nordiques gear?
coloradoavalanche,lxt58p9,2024-11-18 15:02:15,They aren't associated with the mild cheer on a native!
coloradoavalanche,lxt3mnr,2024-11-18 14:54:08,I’m seeing that presale opens on the 21st at 8AM. It would surely be foolish to open up sails with no warning

coloradoavalanche,lxsuedo,2024-11-18 14:07:42,Not to mention… former Av Kenny Klee coaches the Minnesota team!
coloradoavalanche,lxt65rx,2024-11-18 15:07:00,I’m so silly; thank you!! Everything now makes more sense lol!
coloradoavalanche,lxpb7l9,2024-11-17 22:38:22,They changed the seats in sec 343 to same crappy configuration mid season one year. Seats are really narrow cup holders not deep enough.  People hit cups of beer and soda all the time getting up and down thus they spill everywhere. I’ve tried to complain but it went unheard.
coloradoavalanche,lxpbo56,2024-11-17 22:41:30,I’m the same size as you and I always knock tall boy cans off those seats. I’ve learned to hold my beer the entire time lol
coloradoavalanche,lxpcble,2024-11-17 22:45:53,The seats get wider and the cup holders deeper as you go closer to the ice. We usually sit all the way up top but got some tickets in 100’s last year and it’s like going from a metal desk chair to a recliner!
coloradoavalanche,lxpdg4p,2024-11-17 22:53:38,The seats in the nose bleeds at Ball are unfortunately abysmal in terms of space and convenience. Went to a game last weekend at the United Center while visiting Chicago. Sat in the nosebleeds there and the seats were roomier and had cup holders by your feet so you didn’t knock your drink over anytime you moved your arms. Recently filled out a survey for Ball arena letting them know how awful their seats were in the upper level. Especially frustrating as a season ticket holder who sits there regularly.
coloradoavalanche,lxpbzn8,2024-11-17 22:43:36,The cupholders are pretty useless because anything you put in them is definitely going to be knocked over.  I think some seats have the cupholders on the seat in front instead of on the arms?
coloradoavalanche,lxpaxp4,2024-11-17 22:36:30,Yeah the cup holders make some of the seats a bit tight in and out. Usually not an issue while seated just while getting up or down Also it’s Avs not Aves
coloradoavalanche,lxq696f,2024-11-18 03:06:46,Well crap. It’s been almost 20 years since I went to a game at Ball and I’ll be there in a few months. This does not bode well for a 6’6” 240 guy like me. 
coloradoavalanche,lxpfcap,2024-11-17 23:06:53,I upgraded my season ticket seats for this very reason. My bf is a tall broad gent and he was so uncomfortable! I'm a larger gal and I felt like if we were uncomfortable I can't imagine the imposition we were for our neighbors!
coloradoavalanche,lxpxqol,2024-11-18 01:38:03,I swear one day I’m gonna trip on something and fall to my death. It’s so narrow
coloradoavalanche,lxs8vbq,2024-11-18 12:19:54,Spouse and I went to the Bruins game and scored some tickets just 4 rows away from the ice - great seats no issues.We went to the Kraken game on the 5th. We sat in one of the corners of the 100s (section 124 or 126 I can’t remember but it was row 18) and holy crap was the seat uncomfortable! Granted I have wider hips but my god it actually physically hurt to sit in those seats. Now I’m wary of going to another game. We can’t exactly afford those row 4 seats all the time - it’d be nice to know the size of the seats so I’ll know whether I can even fit.
coloradoavalanche,lxsjl62,2024-11-18 13:13:35,Please don’t let people give you shit for not being a “native”. It’s some BS. I’m 6’2” if you can find seats in the first row of the 300s you’ll have a lot more room and a better view sometimes the prices are high sometimes they’re reasonable (50-70 each)
coloradoavalanche,lxpmq3g,2024-11-18 00:00:38,This was me last week. Lost most a beer to those terrible cup holders.
coloradoavalanche,lxsxt8j,2024-11-18 14:24:46,"Same here. They even sent a ""tech"" to look at them and said there was nothing wrong. Pffff. I always tell people to hold their drinks."
coloradoavalanche,lxpcefz,2024-11-17 22:46:25,I am an average sized woman and I knock drinks out too. The cup holder placement is *terrible.*
coloradoavalanche,lxpbnjz,2024-11-17 22:41:23,Was definitely not an issue when in the seats
coloradoavalanche,lxoh3jf,2024-11-17 19:31:21,Yes it’s on Roku now and haven’t had any issues
coloradoavalanche,lxpcw65,2024-11-17 22:49:48,Worked fine for me last game
coloradoavalanche,lxpdhh3,2024-11-17 22:53:54,We just got this a few days ago. Alt 2 didn't work for the game the other night and had to stream from tablet to  the tv(alt+ android app worked fine though)
coloradoavalanche,lxtq144,2024-11-18 16:47:31,Alt 2 worked fine on alt+ last time.  Have Fubo (till the 20th) and it did not work for alt2...  YMMV...
coloradoavalanche,lxojegs,2024-11-17 19:44:58,It wouldnt load alt 2 the other night when both were on…but now loads both so wont know until double header day again…stream is noice when it works though
coloradoavalanche,lxp1vwk,2024-11-17 21:38:20,Good to hear!
coloradoavalanche,lxp1s17,2024-11-17 21:37:39,Yeah I imagine it’s in beta testing still lol.  They always put these apps out prematurely.  Thanks for the update!
coloradoavalanche,lxo9qhg,2024-11-17 18:49:10,yeah thats pretty standard for a Kiszla article. Dude is a hack who never has anything good to say because he's from the old guard like Dater and Chambers.
coloradoavalanche,lxoaj3b,2024-11-17 18:53:48,All my homies hate Mark Kiszla
coloradoavalanche,lxoddu7,2024-11-17 19:10:20,I just peeked my head in these comments to make sure everyone was shitting on Kiz. As you were everyone.
coloradoavalanche,lxot1pa,2024-11-17 20:43:37,I've been as angry at Val as anyone over how he's hung us out to dry more than once. It was unprofessional and heavily impacted the SC window for this team.But after watching his post-game interview on Friday I'm willing to give him a little slack. For someone who rarely likes to do interviews anyway to put himself out there at such a fraught time when he knew he needed to answer for his behavior is laudable. Not to mention that this behemoth of a person visibly choked up on camera when asked how he was handling regaining his team's trust. He clearly isn't taking it lightly. So long as he truly intends to work on getting better which it seemed he is that's all any of us can really ask of him at this stage. He's got my (qualified) support and Kiszla can shove it.
coloradoavalanche,lxoapr7,2024-11-17 18:54:53,Kiz is such a loser.
coloradoavalanche,lxoc4p0,2024-11-17 19:03:08,First game back. Hwo do you have any opinion on his play on his first game back lol. If you have an opinion one way or the other you're a 
coloradoavalanche,lxohbpt,2024-11-17 19:32:41,It's mark kizsla. It's a guarantee to be shit
coloradoavalanche,lxo9vfx,2024-11-17 18:49:58,I'm not even gonna read the whole thing.  From what I did read.. the author of that article is still bitter about the last two times he bailed on us.  That is... understandable... I feel the same way.  like you said though nothing we can really do with him but keep him and pay him and then we absolutley have to play him.  Didn't even think he looked that bad.  He created some pretty nice scoring chances that didn't pan out but it's his first game in 6 months.  He'll get there.... or worst case will happen and then we won't have to worry about him.  Hope he does keep it together this time.  His presence is absolutley missed when he's not there.
coloradoavalanche,lxob47e,2024-11-17 18:57:15,The choo choo train needs to keep the work up!!
coloradoavalanche,lxow1lm,2024-11-17 21:02:02,I didn't even have to click on the link to know this was a Kiszla article. He's such a douche.
coloradoavalanche,lxsoynj,2024-11-18 13:40:32,Kizla writes these articles because it get's clicks and comments. Best thing to do with Kizla is to ignore him completely
coloradoavalanche,lxomelo,2024-11-17 20:02:57,All I can say is I hope Val conquers his demons. Painkiller addiction is not uncommon.  When Val is healthy he cannot be stopped.
coloradoavalanche,lxp374q,2024-11-17 21:46:24,"Mark Kiszla is the worst ""sports columnist"" in the history of professional sports. His take on the Broncos and Sean Payton when they were 0-2 should have gotten him laughed out of a job."
coloradoavalanche,lxpzz3v,2024-11-18 02:00:07,That article is schizophrenic as hell. The whole team played like trash hence the score. Personally I'm done with the histrionics on all sides. Nichushkin has used up every ounce of good will I had for him but I'm not going to actively root against my team. I'm just going to sit back and see how it plays out. My expectations for Nichushkin are at zero. It's totally up to him to live up or down to them.
coloradoavalanche,lxrp73r,2024-11-18 10:37:57,Didn’t even have to look to know it was Kiszla if it’s Kiszla or Keeler we just move to the next
coloradoavalanche,lxsu4jv,2024-11-18 14:06:20,"All I had to see was ""Mark Kizla"". Fuck him I've always hated him."
coloradoavalanche,lxt0ofu,2024-11-18 14:39:12,Remember clicks and click engagement is the new measurement. Don't give them clicks.
coloradoavalanche,lxqis82,2024-11-18 05:26:49,Wait wait wait. You’re telling me a player can’t be on the program and not playing hockey for almost half a year and NOT get a Hatty his first game back? Clearly he’s a bum!/s
coloradoavalanche,lxr712l,2024-11-18 08:50:07,This guy knows absolutely nothing of what happens behind the scenes. MacKinnon calling him a good teammate isn’t coddling it’s his opinion. I’d respect his take more if he had some inside access but he’s just a blowhard with a hottake.
coloradoavalanche,lxs3kz4,2024-11-18 11:53:03,When I saw who wrote it I didn't even bother to open.
coloradoavalanche,lxti0zk,2024-11-18 16:07:09,I don’t like this article AND I can’t stand* Val.
coloradoavalanche,lxtrl1l,2024-11-18 16:55:22,Kiszla and James Merilatt can both fuck off
coloradoavalanche,lxopnp8,2024-11-17 20:22:48,Kizla writes to drive clicks. If he plays 20.games like Friday ok maybe. But 1 game after 6 no with no training camp? Probably gonna be rough for a while
coloradoavalanche,lxowm6l,2024-11-17 21:05:35,Sports writers seem to be as bad as some random redditor. I don't even bother with them.
coloradoavalanche,lxokaz2,2024-11-17 19:50:18,Is what it is.
coloradoavalanche,lxoh8go,2024-11-17 19:32:09,Pretty sure that’s half the sub too tho
coloradoavalanche,lxowcmh,2024-11-17 21:03:56,Was it just me or did you hear boos whenever he touched the puck that game? I was at the game and thought I heard it.Was pretty frustrated about it. Even with his mistakes you gotta hope he figures it out and hope we can support him in that.
coloradoavalanche,lxouot6,2024-11-17 20:53:40,Oh he’ll bounce back and be bad ass again he’ll wait till playoffs to fuck the team over again
coloradoavalanche,lxoq4o2,2024-11-17 20:25:43,counterpoint: Fuck Val
coloradoavalanche,lxpe312,2024-11-17 22:58:02,Fuck Val. He certainly has fucked us for the last 2 years.
coloradoavalanche,lxogbyy,2024-11-17 19:27:03,Kiszla has hated everything in Denver since he got a job covering Denver sports. He sucks.
coloradoavalanche,lxpjvnt,2024-11-17 23:39:28,it’s crazy to think about when guys like kiszla and dater were the like biggest sources on avs news and now i have them blocked so i don’t accidentally read their shit takes lmao
coloradoavalanche,lxonua8,2024-11-17 20:11:43,Kiszla just bounces from rage bait to rage bait for engagement. Doesn’t matter the sport/team.
coloradoavalanche,lxpmbc4,2024-11-17 23:57:30,When Val got suspended the last time Kismyasszla wrote a pretty scathing article about Val. I wrote to Kis saying...  come on man you don't know anything about Val or his situation. If it is suspension for some sort of drug he needs help. It's not a moral issue it's more than that. I also asked Kis if that is all he has left is to spew sh*t about whoever garners news for the day. His stuff is angry and a little psycho.Homeboy wrote me back immediately and he was so unprofessional. Yelling at me about this and that. I never have liked his schtick but after that outburst of a crazy old man I blocked everything he puts out. It's all trash.
coloradoavalanche,lxoiox7,2024-11-17 19:40:42,Wass crackin bro
coloradoavalanche,lxoeg5x,2024-11-17 19:16:32,What's up homie?
coloradoavalanche,lxokqbd,2024-11-17 19:52:50,Since he got to Denver homie.
coloradoavalanche,lxrolkj,2024-11-18 10:34:42,That was my thought exactly…. Carry on.
coloradoavalanche,lxp5ryy,2024-11-17 22:02:39,Yes. Got to support him. There is no other choice both personally and for the team. Kiz is a POS for putting this out there after his first game back when he didn't look bad. Nuk has a problem he is fighting with. The SC took him and Landy from us. At least Nuk has been back with us even though he has faltered at the worst possible times the last two years. I welcome him back with hope that he can get right. Not confidence but hope! Got to support this guy and help him get over the problem that has been haunting him. Will he let us the fans down again? Maybe. Will he let the team down again? Maybe. Will he let himself down again? Maybe. But not supporting him will make any of those scenarios more likely.  Let's go Val!  Make yourself proud make your teammates proud make us fans proud!   But mostly you make yourself proud!!!!
coloradoavalanche,lxp7inx,2024-11-17 22:13:55,I thought it was a good interview.  It does seem like he's taking it seriously and is working to get back on track.  And for Kizla to complain that Val isn't contributing in his first game back after not playing for 6 months in a game where we only got points from our fourth line?  Yeah... let's give him a few games before making that judgment.
coloradoavalanche,lxrhohs,2024-11-18 09:55:52,I honestly think he mainly “avoids” interviews because of the language barrier. He seems fine in interviews where he can speak Russian. If we hired an interpreter kind of like the Dodgers did for Ohtani he’d probably be very comfortable doing postgame interviews.
coloradoavalanche,lxod1pv,2024-11-17 19:08:27,Yeah he looked like a guy that while his individual fitness and skills seemed fine hasn’t seen a game in months and hasn’t had a chance to develop any timing with his linemates. It’s a process. If he still looks like that after two weeks of games that’s when you write this article.
coloradoavalanche,lxtf9j4,2024-11-18 15:53:15,His random adventure over to shit on Juice before coming back to Val was…interesting.Kiz is a terrible writer who douches for clicks.
coloradoavalanche,lxoihtm,2024-11-17 19:39:32,Haha these bitches acting like they didn’t want the guy out of town months agoNow they welcome him back with flowers
coloradoavalanche,lxp825x,2024-11-17 22:17:25,I was saying Choo-urns.
coloradoavalanche,lxory7h,2024-11-17 20:36:52,He's didn't hate talking up all the times Manning suffered him. He's a pro name dropper.
coloradoavalanche,lxool6a,2024-11-17 20:16:15,![gif](giphy|SSzF51pGK1VeOwOiVt|downsized)
coloradoavalanche,lxs39s4,2024-11-18 11:51:28,See I've heard the language barrier is maybe a small part of why he avoids interviews but not the main reason. And he does fine in English interviews as well. Not great but fine. Besides he's been in the US playing hockey for over 10 years. Ohtani has only been playing MLB for six years and he's actively working on getting better at English and not using an interpreter. Plus if the Avs decided to foot the bill for a Russian interpreter they'd probably be pressured to provide one for every player who's not Canadian or American and there's no part of me that thinks Kroenke is that generous!I just thought it was noteworthy that he's a player we don't normally get to hear from who also had some 'splaining to do and he was big enough to recognize that and do it even if/though it made him uncomfortable. Imo it shows good character and makes him worthy of a bit of grace.
coloradoavalanche,lxok5gm,2024-11-17 19:49:23,Exactly. Half the sub was down for just cutting him and eating his contract lmao. I wouldn’t be shocked at all if one day it all came out that he has an addiction to alcohol or painkillers or a combination of the two. Both of which you’re widely exposed to as a high level athlete. Don’t get me wrong dude definitely needs to take accountability. That’s the only way to beat addiction but acting like we can just cut ties and this team would be fine without him is criminally neglectful.
coloradoavalanche,lxolazj,2024-11-17 19:56:18,I don't give a shit if he's an addict. I hope he gets treatment and whatever.But he's fucked over the team twice and done it in some particularly heinous ways. Being an addict doesn't mean he gets a pass and as far as I'm concerned he's a waste of roster space until proven otherwise. I used to be a huge fan of his but that's over. I don't welcome him back at all.
coloradoavalanche,lxom11s,2024-11-17 20:00:41,You obvs don't know anyone with an addiction  or you do and choose not to understand it.
coloradoavalanche,lxowywy,2024-11-17 21:07:46,If his teammates are vouching for him as Nate particularly has that’s all we can go off of. The dude wants to win more than anyone. If he is saying he is a great person and great player we gotta believe him. He wouldn’t be saying this if he didn’t believe it.
coloradoavalanche,lxon9cs,2024-11-17 20:08:09,Lol ok bud
coloradoavalanche,lxquyjx,2024-11-18 07:23:21,What's to know? He has an addiction that addiction drives him to make bad choices. Actions have consequences. Isn't accepting those consequences part of recovery? I can accept that he has a disease and needs treatment but also accept that he's fucked the team over twice and greatly prefer that he not be a part of the team at all.
coloradoavalanche,lxqv1pl,2024-11-18 07:24:04,What else would he say when the contract basically means we don't have a choice?
coloradoavalanche,lxnze7u,2024-11-17 17:48:51,What are you giving up for Seattle's #1 goaltender?
coloradoavalanche,lxo18cs,2024-11-17 17:59:24,I doubt Seattle is going to easily trade the goalie they just signed to a 5 year extension so I'd say he's not an option
coloradoavalanche,lxod8ym,2024-11-17 19:09:36,They just signed him to a 5-year extension a month ago that kicks in next year. He's just about as off the market as one can be. So considering that we would have to pay a hefty premium. In conclusion no.
coloradoavalanche,lxo303o,2024-11-17 18:09:35,I’ll stick with our guys thanks haha
coloradoavalanche,lxq80b6,2024-11-18 03:26:10,Oh I’m sure they would totally trade him for Makar 
coloradoavalanche,lxo00ci,2024-11-17 17:52:20,My starting offer is Parker Kelly’s jockstrap a bottle of Breckenridge Bourbon and a sack of used pucks. Also Seattle retains half the salary. Who says no?
coloradoavalanche,lxrq7gj,2024-11-18 10:43:23,Yeah Makar sounds like exactly what they would be asking for a 28 year old career AHL goalie who's had his first quality season in the NHL last year.
coloradoavalanche,lxo188l,2024-11-17 17:59:23,Throw in Yan Stastny for good measure

coloradoavalanche,lxnvoun,2024-11-17 17:27:48,Jack Campbell is bad and doesn't play for the Flyers
coloradoavalanche,lxsl0jc,2024-11-18 13:20:45,fuuuuuuuuuuuck no
coloradoavalanche,lxng584,2024-11-17 16:02:39,"It's Kähkönen. ""Kakkonen"" would mean number two or more specifically ""the second one"" in Finnish.    Also I don't see how Jack Campbell would do any better for us than he has done for the Oilers or the Red Wings which is to say poorly. Our goaltending woes will not be solved by any goalie that is put on waivers they are put there for a reason."
coloradoavalanche,lxnhg1h,2024-11-17 16:09:34,Craig Anderson Jacob Markstrom.Players are waived all the time to go on conditioning stints under the assumption that their contracts will keep them from being claimed. There was literally a discussion amongst professionals that we should have done this to Giorgiev this season.
coloradoavalanche,lxnmq3b,2024-11-17 16:38:24,??? This comment is just nothing but misinformation?    Markström was traded from Florida to Vancouver left Vancouver to Calgary through free agency and then was traded to Devils. Anderson was on the waivers a few times in like 2006 before he established himself as an NHL goaltender?  I don't know how Campbell's contract would be the issue he's making league minimum after being bought out last summer. It's his play that's the problem.     And conditioning stints after an injury don't require waivers in the first place.
coloradoavalanche,lxo4m3q,2024-11-17 18:19:07,2014/15 Markstrom was sent to Utica and cleared waivers. You can disagree with me about Campbell all you want but don't come in here and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.
coloradoavalanche,lxobk82,2024-11-17 18:59:50,"> 2014/15 Markstrom was sent to Utica and cleared waivers. That has nothing to do with what you are talking about. At the time he had 31 NHL games played over 3 seasons and had a 1.2M cap hit.     He was not put on waivers for a ""conditioning stint"" and sure as hell was not assumed to not be claimed because of his contract. Nobody claimed him because at the time he did not look like an NHL goalie."
coloradoavalanche,lxook9a,2024-11-17 20:16:06,But he turned out to be one of the best. Point standsNice back pedal though. Told me everything I said was misinformation.
coloradoavalanche,lxq9udg,2024-11-18 03:46:54,You said they were put on waivers for a conditioning stint (which still does not require waivers) and that their teams banked on their contracts guaranteeing that they were not picked up. Both plainly false and not applicable to the Jack Campbell situation at all. Fucking ice-brain.
coloradoavalanche,lxqv6gs,2024-11-18 07:25:09,"I did not. I said that decent players are placed on waivers all the time. Those were examples of guys I gave that were waived and went on to make an impact because you said that nobody that was waived would solve our goaltending woes. Never said anything about those two being conditioning stints.I think you need to go back and reread the conversation. As an aside ""conditioning stints"" are not always injury related. That's just the term they use when a player is being sent down because it sounds better then ""you're playing shit so we're going to put you against weaker opponents"""
coloradoavalanche,lxr0g7n,2024-11-18 08:05:23,> I said that decent players are placed on waivers all the time. Do you have memory issues? What you said was:    > Players are waived all the time to go on conditioning stints under the assumption that their contracts will keep them from being claimed.     The issues in that and in your latest comment are as follows:    1. Conditioning stint has a very specific meaning in the NHL and it is not used when someone is put on waivers for not being NHL level. It is specifically used for post-injury conditioning which does not require waivers and is very short in length. You can use it however you want but don't expect anyone else to understand your different meaning.     2. You never said decent you actually said that their contracts would prevent them from being claimed which implies they are not decent at all.    3. Neither Anderson nor Markström was ever put on waivers in a situation similar to Campbell nor did they have contracts that would have prevented them from being claimed. That was before they had any kind of NHL reputation. Campbell on the other hand had NHL reputation but then played badly enough to fall out of favor a completely different scenario.
coloradoavalanche,lxs4k2n,2024-11-18 11:57:59,Damn did you have to cook him like that? lmao.
coloradoavalanche,lxmfoqw,2024-11-17 12:48:36,The hockey gods giveth then they taketh away. 
coloradoavalanche,lxme4kb,2024-11-17 12:39:56,Ugh  had to be a sacrifice for getting so many guys back.
coloradoavalanche,lxmecjw,2024-11-17 12:41:11,We wanted Juice to start it's trial by fire time. I believe
coloradoavalanche,lxmf2i7,2024-11-17 12:45:11,Miner showed sparks of ability….
coloradoavalanche,lxmdwdh,2024-11-17 12:38:40,Uh oh. Hope Justus is up to the task.
coloradoavalanche,lxo0qhl,2024-11-17 17:56:33,"Vegas be like ""we can retroactively put guys on IR?"""
coloradoavalanche,lxmfe58,2024-11-17 12:46:58,Welcome to Denver Mr. Kahkonen.... what?
coloradoavalanche,lxmkgae,2024-11-17 13:14:35,Annunen will be fine. Honestly this is a good case to see if annunen can survive as back up for playoffs of if we need to use assets for one. All early I. The season when the points arent as important
coloradoavalanche,lxmgw3d,2024-11-17 12:55:12,With the news the the cap will likely be 95-97 mil next year I hope we go out to get an actual high end goalie
coloradoavalanche,lxmiyqf,2024-11-17 13:06:33,This for cap shenanigans?
coloradoavalanche,lxows2u,2024-11-17 21:06:36,Man I hate to be a bit doomy on a Sunday off day but this offseason for the front office has been a bit of a disaster.Kylington Brannstrom de Haan. Maybe one of them has worked out? And Brannstrom has been great in Van. No Mikko extension and he's currently one goal off the lead and 7th in points in the league. That has increased his asking price for sure. No 3rd goalie and we were one injury away from Miner playing NHL games (in his very small sample size he looked okay). Kahkonen waived at a terrible time. On the bright side the Drouin contract was good Parker Kelly has looked good of late and happy with LOCs contract although he needs to lift his play.
coloradoavalanche,lxncg8i,2024-11-17 15:43:46,Campbell on waivers today makes this slightly more interesting
coloradoavalanche,lxogr5k,2024-11-17 19:29:22,They've been on the taketh
coloradoavalanche,lxmgoc6,2024-11-17 12:54:02,"At this point I'm willing to throw anyone in there for as long as they can put up numbers.I think our ""obligation"" to play Giorgiev has subsided. We should be playing the best guy at the time regardless of who that is."
coloradoavalanche,lxn6tkl,2024-11-17 15:13:25,"""sparks of ability"" might as well be the motto for the entire goaltending situation for this team."
coloradoavalanche,lxs0sqj,2024-11-18 11:39:00,Hahahahaha I just snorted laughing
coloradoavalanche,lxmu52l,2024-11-17 14:05:09,no worries i believe Johansson is around here somewhere
coloradoavalanche,lxmql93,2024-11-17 13:46:40,The points are always important. When it comes to playoff time and you realize had they won this game or that game or beaten this division rival here or there and suddenly you’re a 2 seed instead of a 6 seed.
coloradoavalanche,lxn5pxo,2024-11-17 15:07:24,John Gibson for Georgie Behrens and a 2nd Ducks retain half.
coloradoavalanche,lxmi4tq,2024-11-17 13:02:02,It’ll go to Mikko
coloradoavalanche,lxno00n,2024-11-17 16:45:23,Its gonna be $92.5mill next season.
coloradoavalanche,lxmr6b8,2024-11-17 13:49:44,Seems that way. Another reported said he’d be eligible to come off IR in time for the game in DC and is expected to travel with the team.
coloradoavalanche,lxmzj8u,2024-11-17 14:33:38,IR doesn't give cap relief only frees up a roster spot.
coloradoavalanche,lxn61ur,2024-11-17 15:09:13,There’s the obligation but also he has low trade value at the moment. He needs those minutes and chances because we will never be able to move that contract if he’s riding pine. It sucks for fans I really wish he were playing well.
coloradoavalanche,lxntqg6,2024-11-17 17:17:00,Ducks say no any day of the week and twice on Sunday
coloradoavalanche,lxmjph9,2024-11-17 13:10:33,Best cap scenario and landeskog being back we’ve got 10 mil after mikko getting a 13 million dollar contract missing a bottom pair and 2 minimum replacement guys. We’ll have enough wiggle room to make a big move work. With Kovalenko I think wood could be moved to make a little room as well and Manson on the last year of his deal could be an option as well
coloradoavalanche,lxnpq5d,2024-11-17 16:54:51,Friedman said yesterday with revenue so high it’s looking like they are gonna raise it more between 95-97
coloradoavalanche,lxnu23s,2024-11-17 17:18:48,IR has no cap implications
coloradoavalanche,lxnc1uf,2024-11-17 15:41:37,Tbf he did genuinely well his last start he just also got injured to do so
coloradoavalanche,lxp2d6m,2024-11-17 21:41:16,He's got some say and at some point you would think he wants to go to an actual contender - Ducks ain't it while he's under contract. We're one of the very few contenders that needs a goalie. They might not retain half but they can afford to eat Georgie's salary. And they'll want a first but that's not been the market for goalies - we can do the late first which is close enough to a second I suppose.
coloradoavalanche,lxnr6ln,2024-11-17 17:02:50,It's scheduled to be 92.5 next season. Friedman did say that you are correct. It depends on what happens during the CBA agreements.
coloradoavalanche,lxnestt,2024-11-17 15:55:56,He did play well the last few games agreed!
coloradoavalanche,lxtyps4,2024-11-18 17:33:05,Also sub in any prospect not named Ritchie. Gotta figure Cronin knows our prospects as well as anyone.
coloradoavalanche,lxm948e,2024-11-17 12:12:05,From the LA Kings game a few nights back. Sat in row 8 section 132. Used a Sony RX100VII because security doesn't yell at me about that little guy compared to my big mirrorless cameras.No clue if there's a future for me risking my gear in the press window but it'd sure be nice haha.
coloradoavalanche,lxmcut2,2024-11-17 12:32:52,Those are nice that MacK (#2) pic is a great shot

coloradoavalanche,lxmmwgn,2024-11-17 13:27:37,don’t take this the wrong way by any means. but it looks like pictures taken by a high school sport photographer and i actually find it really cool because it gives it a different vibe. sick shots.
coloradoavalanche,lxnxsz3,2024-11-17 17:39:44,Those are awesome
coloradoavalanche,lxo4n54,2024-11-17 18:19:18,You should be a sports photographer though!

coloradoavalanche,lxo9a95,2024-11-17 18:46:30,Seriously awesome if you take more you'll have to share them too
coloradoavalanche,lxpmyyo,2024-11-18 00:02:33,What kind of camera and kind of settings were you using for some of these like ISO setting and aperture setting. I always struggled to get decent lighting in an arena.
coloradoavalanche,lxrdiya,2024-11-18 09:31:08,10 looks amazing

coloradoavalanche,lxme5vp,2024-11-17 12:40:08,I liked that one a lot and then I realized I caught the puck perfectly and then I LOVED it!
coloradoavalanche,lxn2ou6,2024-11-17 14:50:50,The Cale one too
coloradoavalanche,lxmfbkc,2024-11-17 12:46:35,Oh don't you worry photography is kind of my main gimmick actually haha. Never had the chance to shoot a game so close though! Gonna always try and bring that camera with me whenever I go now.
coloradoavalanche,lxmp15f,2024-11-17 13:38:40,"Yeah I guess that's not so bad! It's certainly not as clean as what the official accounts post but it's better than anything off a phone at least. I definitely was too critical at first before deciding ""Eh that's honestly the best I'll get dealing with the barriers and nets"" and I'm still stoked I got what I did!"
coloradoavalanche,lxpnhsp,2024-11-18 00:06:41,Sony RX100VII ISO 2000 Aperture f/4.5 Shot at 1/1000 of a second. Photos ranging from 70-200mm of range. Some might be slightly different but this is generally what I was shooting at.I do wanna throw a disclaimer and say I did edit these in Lightroom after to bring up the brightness and make them appear a bit cooler/more saturated than the raws looked.
coloradoavalanche,lxmsenc,2024-11-17 13:56:11,"Really the 1"" sensor market is like non-existent right now. All about those pocketable APS-C cameras like Fujifilm or Ricoh. I bought the Sony specifically to bring into venues because I wanted something besides my phone to shoot with."
coloradoavalanche,lxmmqoh,2024-11-17 13:26:46,Oh man…. I had to go back and look after this comment.  Great capture.
coloradoavalanche,lxmtcfw,2024-11-17 14:01:02,Oh definitely and the sony is still a very good camera..I’d just love to see it get some modern love haha. Pocketable cameras with bigger than phone sensors are great especially since in most venues interchangeable lens cameras are a no-go.I used to work for the broncos and the dude who was Emmanuel sanders’ personal photographer was just some dude who took awesome pictures at games and Emmanuel liked them so he hired the kid to follow him around 24/7.

coloradoavalanche,lxlkltg,2024-11-17 09:52:23,You definitely get something you can't otherwise get when you sit up there. You can see all the ice at the same time so you can see how the plays develop better than if you were closer or watching the game on TV.
coloradoavalanche,lxm37rb,2024-11-17 11:39:30,Except you’re literally shoulder to shoulder with people next to you
coloradoavalanche,lxird61,2024-11-16 19:48:26,I love the light show they put on using the white of the rink as a white screen.

coloradoavalanche,lxm2of9,2024-11-17 11:36:32,No. There is also some seats way up at the top on each side next to the camera box that might have some views blocked.But that doesn't make much of a headline.

coloradoavalanche,lxor0ao,2024-11-17 20:31:05,That’s freaking awesome man! I’d love to visit Australia one day. How did you become an Avs fan? Sorry to pry I just think it’s interesting that you’re from Australia.
coloradoavalanche,lxoudni,2024-11-17 20:51:47,Joe Sakic. Saw him play once and immediately said that was the guy. I’m young enough that I couldn’t watch them often because of west coast time zone so I was stuck watching…. The leafs  It also helped that 2002 Olympics Sakic was the MVP as well. Surely that’s gotta be it! It’s impossible to get any kind of merch here. It doesn’t exist in ANY store here so everything has to be got online.
coloradoavalanche,lxpxk4l,2024-11-18 01:36:17,I got into hockey thanks to the Mighty Ducks movies and then video games. Ended up becoming an Avalanche fan in the late 90s through the games because they had the best looking logo and jerseys lol.
coloradoavalanche,lxim3wm,2024-11-16 19:16:03,What a title but he is playing his 1000th game tonight.
coloradoavalanche,lxim8w5,2024-11-16 19:16:55,i noticed when the flyers did the little training camp pictures where they make the guys fill out the like first day of kindergarten posters under the “what i want to be when i grow up” he wrote broadcaster…i really hope he comes to altitude when he retires. he’d be great at it and it would be so fun to have him interviewing guys he’s played with
coloradoavalanche,lxiq8xz,2024-11-16 19:41:36,He’s playing in his 1000th game right now but the ceremony will be Monday before we play the Flyers game they lined it up that way on purpose obviously. Will be fun to watch EJ is the man!
coloradoavalanche,lxilji7,2024-11-16 19:12:35,Beyond the fact EJ is an amazing teammate and a goof…I don’t know enough about him to say if he’d be a good coach or even that he’d want to. He has his horses which I imagine take a chunk of his attention but who knows. He’s one of my all time favorite players and someone I think I’d love to just hang out with.
coloradoavalanche,lxioes3,2024-11-16 19:30:13,"I love me a good EJ. The guy took a lot of heat for a team that wasn't good at all. Goaltending was wishy washy and a rotating mess and we had some good pieces but nothing that really stood out for some of those years. Was he the game changer that he was projected to be? Definitely not but he did a good job as a top 4 dman and also earned an all star bid before he got hurt. He wasn't great all the time during the season but when it came to playoffs the guy was one of the better defenders and always tried to give his body up. I just wished he was more physical. At 6'4"" sometimes he just didn't play like that."
coloradoavalanche,lxio08g,2024-11-16 19:27:45,Love EJ
coloradoavalanche,lxkz9n4,2024-11-17 07:11:53,I am in Philadelphia this weekend for a wedding and was at the game last night. It was awesome to see EJ play and he got a pretty good ovation from the crowd when it was announced. Really wish I could have taken another day to see Avs play.
coloradoavalanche,lxu4roa,2024-11-18 18:06:20,Can’t wait to watch him!! I LOVE EJ. He did so much for the Avs. 
coloradoavalanche,lxjycrp,2024-11-17 00:47:49,He's definitely got the face that looks like he would be fun and entertaining. Some people you can just see that they would be duds and his ain't it. Must be that big toothless smile.
coloradoavalanche,lximefq,2024-11-16 19:17:52,So cool for him to reach 1000 games against the team that he’s damn near a legend with.
coloradoavalanche,lxm8v8w,2024-11-17 12:10:40,Would rather him over Yan Stastny
coloradoavalanche,lxisono,2024-11-16 19:56:33,Didn't know Buffalo held him in such high regard after one season 
coloradoavalanche,lxrhlxx,2024-11-18 09:55:28,I'd take almost anyone over Yan. I've never seen someone less natural on camera be consistently put on camera as much as Yan has. Keefer can't even save him and that dude can drag pretty much anyone through a segment.

coloradoavalanche,lxtpne7,2024-11-18 16:45:36,Thank you!
coloradoavalanche,lxgf8ga,2024-11-16 11:56:49,It was not blacked out on the other channel KDTV on Fubo. So even though Altitude 2 was blacked out I still watched it on the KDTV channel via Fubo.
coloradoavalanche,lxhmt3z,2024-11-16 15:50:44,"""why is everyone turning to piracy"" mfs when all they have to do to prevent it is launch a decent and moderately competent product:"
coloradoavalanche,lxgj5wc,2024-11-16 12:18:01,I dunno what everyone is complaining about.KTVD20 is included with the base plan as a local channel alongside the usuals (NBC CBS ABC) on DirecTV Fubo Xfinity and over the air and was not blacked out. The only issue was taking an extra 30 seconds to find the channel after you went to altitude and it said “go watch it on KTVD20 instead”
coloradoavalanche,lxgi2h3,2024-11-16 12:12:08,That's interesting to know.  I don't get KTVD My 20 on the DirecTV Stream Choice Package.  While there is some information out there on the internet that DirecTV allegedly carries it I see no trace of it in searching the guide.  I can readily get MY 20 via antenna but I was watching the Nuggets game on Altitude 1 at the time and usually record the games and watch them in the morning anyway just because that's what suits my biorhythms.  I do not have an over-the-air DVR.
coloradoavalanche,lxgkzgx,2024-11-16 12:27:44,"I've seen that out there even from as usually reliable a source as Edge's CoPilot and Streamables but I don't get KTVD 20 Denver on DirecTV Stream's Choice Package.  It's possible that it is on DTVS's ""Sports Pack"" but I was on that recently on a free promotion and I never noticed it there.  Of course that was before Altitude Season and these MY20 Exclusives did not yet exist either.This is purely a recording issue for me since I can get MY20 via antenna and usually go to bed too early for the games live.  Perhaps it is only available where it is not available via antenna.  I don't know.  The point is I was ALREADY paying for the games but now they want me to pay extra for these particular games.  I mainly just wanted to see Nichushkin's return."
coloradoavalanche,lxh7uxf,2024-11-16 14:29:15,Yeah all this stuff is supremely frustrating. Having to hunt for the games on multiple services and multiple channels.
coloradoavalanche,lxgle74,2024-11-16 12:29:56,Gotcha… I think you should double check your package because it’s a local channel and should be included at no extra cost if you have the other local channels.
coloradoavalanche,lxh8qyt,2024-11-16 14:34:00,Yes they make it as expensive confusing and inconvenient as possible for the customers.Television watching used to be so simple.
coloradoavalanche,lxglosk,2024-11-16 12:31:30,It's a local channel but it is a subchannel of Channel 9 Denver so it is NOT included.  I have double- and triple-checked in just the past hour.
coloradoavalanche,lxh91zk,2024-11-16 14:35:38,Yep. Greed kills everything.
coloradoavalanche,lxgm473,2024-11-16 12:33:47,My brother in law gets it with his directv package I think you should recheck. He’s in broomfield maybe it’s different up there but he has it.
coloradoavalanche,lxgmhbg,2024-11-16 12:35:42,DirecTV and DirecTV Stream are not exactly the same thing.  If it were there my cloud DVR would have auto-recorded it as is set to do no matter which channel it was on.
coloradoavalanche,lxgopxm,2024-11-16 12:47:31,Ok… he has the stream not the dish but you know what you have.
coloradoavalanche,lxizs24,2024-11-16 20:41:15,I'm in the same boat. I used to have DirecTV satellite which included channel 20. When my receiver went out I switched to DirecTV stream and channel 20 is not included in my package.Thanks for the info about the repeats. If I miss an especially exciting or controversial game it's nice to know I can record it and see it after the fact at least.
coloradoavalanche,lxfywv8,2024-11-16 10:26:49,That was painful
coloradoavalanche,lxi9wr5,2024-11-16 18:00:14,EJ is playing his 1000th game tonight!
coloradoavalanche,lxiadn2,2024-11-16 18:03:09,Crappy game but Miner played great especially considering it was his first game in the NHL.
coloradoavalanche,lxggnxy,2024-11-16 12:04:35,I think this was the lack of chemistry from so many players coming back. The new players haven’t built up the same level of hustle and determination. And they don’t have a full grasp of how this group plays the system.

coloradoavalanche,lxfqdic,2024-11-16 09:34:41,Well I was disappointed with Annunen last night thought he'd come out and rock the crease but I still want to see more of what he can do. Unfortunately we dont have time to wait tho :/Only scored 2 goals at least it was from depth guys. Happy to see Kelly get a goal and an assist he played his butt off  Overall just an off night from the team wouldnt chalk it up as anything to be super concerned about. We do need to start rattling off wins though at some point. Concerned about our goaltending still. I know Georgiev is hurt and Annunen is young but I just dont have confidence in either of them being good enough to get us to a cup win :/ Happily will be proved wrong
coloradoavalanche,lxfy1w8,2024-11-16 10:21:47,Gotta work on our puck control. Seems like we were doing a lot of tape to tape passes right into a waiting crapital.
coloradoavalanche,lxj7dzr,2024-11-16 21:30:47,Watched the Tyson fight last night instead and I can’t tell if this would have been more disappointing or not 
coloradoavalanche,lxfrdx3,2024-11-16 09:41:14,We have an offensive minded D-core. We either need to score a ton of goals or get an upgrade in net.
coloradoavalanche,lxgt27c,2024-11-16 13:10:32,Yo are people booing the pride flag at the game? I've been to a ton of games but none this year- can't recall anything like that. Really hope this poster was mistaken. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1gsrlu5/avalanche\_game\_pride\_banner/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1gsrlu5/avalanche_game_pride_banner/)
coloradoavalanche,lxg5tla,2024-11-16 11:05:34,The only real concern I had coming out of that game was Juice shitting the bed. Otherwise meh. Bad game against a kind of hot team from the East. Not a big deal. It did make my Friday night much less enjoyable however. The boys owe me a big weekend win sometime later in the season to make up for it!
coloradoavalanche,lxkv1wt,2024-11-17 06:29:27,Top players being so low is definitely an eye opener (and also how it felt watching)
coloradoavalanche,lxfx7ja,2024-11-16 10:16:49,Not many upgrades to be had. The goalie market is ass and we don’t have the cap space to buy one.
coloradoavalanche,lxh1e41,2024-11-16 13:54:42,I was at the previous 2 and didn't hear any booing for the flag. There were moose calls but not sure if that coincided with the flag. If it is happening it is a tiny minority
coloradoavalanche,lxib9au,2024-11-16 18:08:41,Have been to 6 games this year and never heard this once. I don’t buy it.
coloradoavalanche,lxi1oea,2024-11-16 17:12:18,There was a pride flag?  I don't recall even seeing one.
coloradoavalanche,lxg8y7i,2024-11-16 11:22:45,How did our D turn so bad? In 2022 it was rock solid and we’ve lost Byram and Johnson since then
coloradoavalanche,lxgjcds,2024-11-16 12:19:01,I don’t really think it’s our D more our DZone play. Forwards making lazy passes that get picked off near the blue line and turn a potential breakout into a sustained hold. Last night was just especially bad since the caps brought out suffocating trap hockey and we couldn’t shake loose with our speedy forwards.
coloradoavalanche,lxf1wof,2024-11-16 06:25:12,"I try to keep my expectations low since there are a lot people here who might be new to hockey or to Avs but holy shit. You aren't even beating a dead horse anymore bud you're beating a glue bottle made from the horse.    Anyway to answer the question maybe? This plan has a lot of issues.    1. We do not have the cap space. In fact if Landy does actually come back we need to ship out like 4-5 million. And even if he doesn't we don't have a whole lot of space. And our depth doesn't really allow us to ship out a lot of salary. You can't really trade out anyone in top-4 D because we don't have anyone to replace them. Can't ship out anyone in the top-6 same thing. And guys like Kelly or Kovalenko make so little that trading them makes no sense.    2. The goalie market is *dry*. Drier than Sahara drier than my mom after you made a move on her. There's already a bunch of teams who don't have a good starter and we are unfortunately one of them. Blackwood might be on the market but that's another injury prone goalie using him as ""insurance"" makes no sense because likely he's the one out injured first. Gibson maybe? But we can't fit in that cap hit and we'd take a risk in seeing whether he can revert to his prior form when the Ducks were at least decent.    3. Trade with what? As we previously established we can't really move out any roster players. We don't have any blue chip prospects a couple of decent ones (Ritchie Nabokov) but they don't hold that much trade value and their value for us is likely much bigger should they become NHLers. That leaves picks but we've traded a lot of them away already. Hard to see any team that would be willing to trade a goalie get excited about a late 1st in 2026.    4. Team structure. This team is built so that we don't have a lot of money left on goaltending. The skaters need to be good enough that we can win with mediocrity like we did with One-Eyed Kuemper. Maybe an established NHL back-up might help? But honestly that's unlikely to change the team's trajectory one way or another."
coloradoavalanche,lxfbkqr,2024-11-16 07:51:13,The Sakic-MacFarland philosophy has always been to prioritize skaters and skimp on goaltending. We haven’t had an elite goaltender in this era and anytime we have a goalie heading into FA we drop them and start looking for a replacement rather than pay them. And it’s paid off until this season when our goalies are just extra porous. 
coloradoavalanche,lxgez72,2024-11-16 11:55:27,We desperately need even an average goaltender but I just don't see how the Avs can make it work right now. Just pray that the big dogs upstairs can figure something out by the trade deadline. Certainly there are some under the radar goalies out there that can provide better tending than the Avs have been getting. If they can't find anyone you just have to hope georgie can keep himself together enough to be average come playoff time.
coloradoavalanche,lxi5kza,2024-11-16 17:34:39,It's gonna need to be a cheap veteran or it isn't gonna happen. Nedelkjovic. Reimer. Etc. Not gonna be flashy but Trent Miner ain't ready for NHL time and Annunen looks great on his good days but totally volatile on the bad days. I genuinely think he could use more time with the Eagles too
coloradoavalanche,lxfvrnd,2024-11-16 10:08:14,Mikko for Shesterkin. Colton seemed to hang on the top line no problem and was the leading scorer for over a week after his injury.  We'd never lose again.
coloradoavalanche,lxf5b0i,2024-11-16 06:57:31,If they don't get a good goalie in net who can compete with the guy across the way most nights or flat out duel them on some occasions they won't win another cup. So I hope it's the priority at or before the deadline this year.
coloradoavalanche,lxf0mcl,2024-11-16 06:12:27,Yes. We badly need goaltending and George isn't the answer.
coloradoavalanche,lxf4irv,2024-11-16 06:50:17,Great reply  really covers all the points.   Just wanted to add that we recently had another veteran NHL goaltender on our roster in Kahkonen who is a great example of who is available on the market.  A back-up goalie who has had flashes in his career.  We added him to kick the tires but decided the guys we have are just better.  The market for goalies being what it is the moment we waived him he was picked up.  Time to circle the wagons around Georgie and Juice cuz it ain't getting better.
coloradoavalanche,lxfe5ih,2024-11-16 08:11:05,Also I’m not sure about you but I’d like to see this team win another cup while we have the amazing roster that we do. When I was 7 I got to see this team win the cup and I’ll never forget that feeling finally after over twenty years of waiting I got to see them do it again and it was glorious. Again im not saying we need anyone elite but league average? Is that fine? I’d rather take my chances with John’s Gibson or Blackwood if George doesn’t right the ship soon once he’s back. Kuemper is perpetually injured too but he stayed healthy long enough for most of the year to give us good enough goaltending behind our great skaters to win us a cup. Yes his injury issues showed up again in the playoffs but the point is he stayed healthy enough to give us quality goaltending that helped us get a cup. It is impossible to get a cup with .860-.880 goaltending. You need some semblance of reliability
coloradoavalanche,lxfvacv,2024-11-16 10:05:21,Mikko for Shesterkin straight up. We would never lose again.
coloradoavalanche,lxfc45a,2024-11-16 07:55:30,I think Gibson makes sense if Anaheim eats some of the salary cap hit. Georgiev would go to Ducks with draft pick(s) or prospect(s). Anaheim is confident with Dostal and should finally move Gibson.But as you've said it's hard to make things work cap-wise.
coloradoavalanche,lxfc7il,2024-11-16 07:56:12,"Upvote for ""glue bottle"" and your mom. "
coloradoavalanche,lxfcsfu,2024-11-16 08:00:47,Been watching the avs as well as hockey for my entire life. I’m trying to be nice about Georgiev because it seems if anyone says anything bad about him on this sub they get downvoted to hell. If we traded Georgiev and a few picks to the sharks for Blackwood that could work. I’m trying to come up with a way to say this without getting hate. I want to see if the rest of the fanbase thinks we should move on and look in another direction. Yes the way this team is built we don’t need a Shesterkin but we need someone who’s at least mildly competent.
coloradoavalanche,lxi4fcv,2024-11-16 17:27:59,Every time someone suggest Kuemper was mediocre that season an angel loses its wings and crashes into the earth killing everything in its path. Fuck off moron with this pointless incorrect slanderous rhetoric. Enoughhhhhhh of this tired bullshit.
coloradoavalanche,lxfd0pj,2024-11-16 08:02:33,We don’t need an elite goaltender but we need a competent goaltender who doesn’t consistently have a sub .900 save pct.
coloradoavalanche,lxgfi9f,2024-11-16 11:58:17,The Rags are not doing this trade ever.
coloradoavalanche,lxhjouo,2024-11-16 15:33:45,>  Colton seemed to hang on the top line no problemYes because he was playing with Mikko on the other wing and Nate in the middle.
coloradoavalanche,lxfd642,2024-11-16 08:03:42,It’s funny if you mention goaltending on this sub or that we need to find someone who’s competent not elite but competent if George doesn’t get it together you just get downvoted to hell and called an idiot.
coloradoavalanche,lxf8qbw,2024-11-16 07:27:33,Would you also tell us how that should work?
coloradoavalanche,lxff5gk,2024-11-16 08:18:24,Yes I’m aware of kappo khakonen and that he was on our team and got claimed off of waivers. As I said I’ve been watching hockey my entire life. I watch every avs game as well as tons of other games when I have free time. Which is most nights. I really don’t think this is a stupid question. It looks to me like most of the fanbase in this sub loves George and if anyone dare says we should maybe look for another option you get downvoted to hell and shit on like crazy. I’m just trying to gauge what the rest of the fanbase thinks at this point and how they feel about potentially making a move for Blackwood or Gibson. I mainly asked because I was shocked at the amount of people on here who don’t think goaltending is an issue or think George has been playing just fine despite him being bottom ten in every advanced stat there is for goalies.
coloradoavalanche,lxfy2qu,2024-11-16 10:21:55,Horrible idea
coloradoavalanche,lxfd0o5,2024-11-16 08:02:32,Given that Georgiev holds no real value at the moment and that we need Anaheim to retain close to the max amount (50%) I think the trade would cost us so much that it kinda stops making sense. Gibson was an elite goalie at one time but that was like 5 years ago. Obviously Ducks have been a horrible team but the point is that we would pay through the nose to get a goalie just to see how much of those stats are on Gibson and how much of them are on the Ducks as a team.
coloradoavalanche,lxfewpz,2024-11-16 08:16:38,Blackwood is very injury prone and honestly not that big of an upgrade over Georgiev
coloradoavalanche,lxpziv2,2024-11-18 01:55:35,The thing about the Keumper year….when he did play like shit we had Frankie to bounce back to. We don’t win that Cup without Frankie stepping up big time when Keumper went down.
coloradoavalanche,lxi7il7,2024-11-16 17:45:51,> Fuck off moron with this pointless incorrect slanderous rhetoric. Damn how fucking dumb are you?    Yes he had a great regular season among the league leaders for the whole regular season and 2 playoff games. After that he got a stick in the eye and we were forced to start Francouz and then as I specified One-Eyed Kuemper. After the excellent 2 games he averaged a .892 save percentage in the playoffs that is well below average actually.     Sure he had some good showings with one shutout and three games over .930 but also had 7 games with under .900 with the low mark coming in at .773.
coloradoavalanche,lxg1tr6,2024-11-16 10:43:33,Um... yes. I believe that average competent goaltending is what the front office banks on from it's mediocre choices at that position. And when you limit teams to 20 shots and let in 4 goals you are not getting that.
coloradoavalanche,lxgr4br,2024-11-16 13:00:11,You're probably right. Could be a win win for both though.
coloradoavalanche,lxho0wf,2024-11-16 15:57:16,Vals back so that problem is solved.  Val is more important than Mikko look at the record with and without val since he joined. Mikko can score but he also relies heavily on everyone else to drive the play. He's the ultimate finisherthat's about it. Not a bad thing it's what he's amazing at.
coloradoavalanche,lxgjz5r,2024-11-16 12:22:22,Dunno. If we are to actually be a contender we need real goaltending though. A highly volatile Georgie & a Juicy rookie isn't it.
coloradoavalanche,lxfgll7,2024-11-16 08:28:47,> t looks to me like most of the fanbase in this sub loves George and if anyone dare says we should maybe look for another option you get downvoted to hell and shit on like crazy.This is the weirdest victim mentality most of this sub fucking hates Georgiev and scapegoats any goalie we have no matter their actual play.
coloradoavalanche,lxfyhie,2024-11-16 10:24:18,Nah it's fantastic.
coloradoavalanche,lxfe9rc,2024-11-16 08:11:57,I agree it would cost a lot. I just feel management must be feeling pressure to address goaltending situation now more than ever before. They are not negotiating from a position of strength for sure but it will be hard to contend for the Cup when it seems the first or second shot every game goes in. Goaltending has been talked about way too often and you're right that the team is structured so that little money goes to that position and in many games the team just needs average goaltending. I just feel now is different and management will do something to appease the players. Just the feeling I get and I think it will be Gibson (if the Oilers don't get him first).
coloradoavalanche,lxffq0r,2024-11-16 08:22:33,Look at the advanced stats and tell me he’s not an upgrade. He’s also playing behind a not very good at all sharks team. He’s been injury prone for most of his career that’s true. But currently the way he’s been playing this year compared to George he’s an upgrade. I’m prepared to get downvoted for making this argument. It seems like most people on this sub either don’t care about making a cup run since we won just three years ago or actually think it’s possible to win with a guy who will probably finish the year with a sub .890 save pct.
coloradoavalanche,lxiesbr,2024-11-16 18:30:44,Yeah that’s true. That’s why I’m wondering about who could possibly be the guy to replace george
coloradoavalanche,lxi56w5,2024-11-16 17:32:23,I think the rags could win the cup this year if they made that trade. They'd never make that trade tho.More importantly the Avs wouldn't either. They ain't paying a goalie that much.
coloradoavalanche,lxhoh21,2024-11-16 15:59:42,Damn how short some people's memories are.     Dude carried us hard in the 22-23 season. Scored 55 goals even though there were stretches where he was the only top-6 forward playing. He was playing with 3rd liners and just lifted the team on his back.
coloradoavalanche,lxig9sh,2024-11-16 18:40:06,Yes valeri at his best (hopefully he can capture is world class form again) is a much more irreplaceable asset on both sides of the ice and in all situations than Mikko i agree. Also what shesterkin (or an elite caliber goaltender) would do for this team on a nightly basis is more significant and important than what mikko provides night to night. This rosters construction would benefit far more from a goalie of shesterkins pedigree than it does from mikko overall.At the same time just finding a quality NHL starter do wonders for this team without even having to think about dealing mikko
coloradoavalanche,lxfi1a8,2024-11-16 08:38:48,Go say something bad about Georgiev and see how many downvotes you get. Any time I’ve ever said anything about him I’ve gotten swarmed. Idk what part of this sub you’re on but point me there.
coloradoavalanche,lxff5a6,2024-11-16 08:18:22,I'd be happy if they made a reasonable deal to get Gibson I think he still has a lot of good hockey in him. Just hard to see a deal that would work for the Ducks and us.
coloradoavalanche,lxfg5lk,2024-11-16 08:25:39,Is it really talked about too much when it’s an issue night after night after night. Every other game has some type of goaltending disaster. Sometimes we win anyway sometimes we don’t. Kind of hard not to talk about when it’s happening all the time.
coloradoavalanche,lxfgesp,2024-11-16 08:27:27,He is an upgrade but not that big that's the point. When you combine that with the fact that you can't rely on him to play the starter role because he's constantly injured it's hard to justify using assets to get him.    Gibson would be a better acquisition but would cost a lot more.    > . It seems like most people on this sub either don’t care about making a cup run     Well that's just a stupid thing to say. Just because people don't want Blackwood or state facts about the goalie market or our cap situation doesn't mean we don't care about winning the Cup. It's just an unfortunate reality that the market is difficult and we don't have a lot of assets or cap space. That combination makes any deal difficult and we shouldn't just go out and spend those few assets to get just any goalie that team's are willing to part with just for the sake of getting a new goalie. Feel like Blackwood would be specifically a very lateral move. We'd end up with meh goaltending and Annunen starting a lot of the time.
coloradoavalanche,lxif2q3,2024-11-16 18:32:35,I’ve been arguing with you about the tender situation but on this subject I feel like you’re the only one speaking facts.
coloradoavalanche,lxhq7mr,2024-11-16 16:09:10,I'm fully aware of what he has done and what his current role is in the team. I've had season tickets for 5 years I watch him float every home game. He doesn't want to carry a team he wants to post up on the circle and shoot when passed to. He's essentially Ovechkin light.  He's one of the best finishers in the league if wanted to do more he would. It's not his style.
coloradoavalanche,lxfgq5p,2024-11-16 08:29:40,I meant over the past several years it has come up a lot. Definitely should be talked about now. This has been next-level bedshitting.
coloradoavalanche,lxfhmyp,2024-11-16 08:36:02,Disagree. As it stands we are not winning a thing with George and annunen in net (annunen is young and it’s not his fault). It would be a lot harder to get a Gibson deal done that would fit under the cap. Trading Georgiev and some picks or some mid tier prospects to San Jose for Blackwood who is on an expiring contract at least gives us a chance to compete if he stays healthy for the rest of the year and continues playing well. Also Blackwood played 44 games last year so he’s been healthy for a bit now without injury. If he doesn’t work out we don’t resign him. Contending teams trade things like picks and prospects to upgrade the team in order to have a shot to win. The goalie free agent market this upcoming offseason isn’t anything to wait for either. Trading for Gibson is a bigger risk but has the potential for a really high reward if he plays like he did before the ducks became awful.
coloradoavalanche,lxfjp4f,2024-11-16 08:50:17,Yeah I mean last year when the goaltending was up and down I could see that it may be a bigger problem in the future but I didn’t say a word. After last nights game and watching all the other disasters this year I had to ask what people were thinking we should do. People get really pissed off when you ask this question though. It would be cooler if they’d just ignore the post if it gets them annoyed for whatever reason rather than getting all worked up. I only ever encounter downvotes and angry people on sports Reddit for some reason. Over on music reddit and other subs it’s only ever positive. Not saying you’re one of these people I’m just pointing it out because it’s frustrating.
coloradoavalanche,lxfi2xy,2024-11-16 08:39:07,I'm just saying that I don't think it's worth it to spend our already thin resources on a low reward gamble like Blackwood. If we'd go shopping would definitely go for the higher reward Gibson.
coloradoavalanche,lxfizw4,2024-11-16 08:45:28,Well if Blackwood is as bad as you say and given his injury history he should be extremely cheap and we should be able to get him for not a lot of assets or resources whatever you want to call them. So it’s low risk potential high reward potential low reward. Gibson would be a high risk for a potentially low reward but potentially very high reward. I would probably go for Gibson first but being as that could be harder to get done I would also be fine with going with Blackwood for this year and giving him a one year deal if he plays well and just moving on from him if he doesn’t.
coloradoavalanche,lxe0i3t,2024-11-16 00:09:25,By far the ugliest score card of the year
coloradoavalanche,lxe2fxd,2024-11-16 00:27:37,If only games were decided on deserved to win o’meter lol
coloradoavalanche,lxe6b9t,2024-11-16 00:58:56,that expected goals is just unacceptable with what we have
coloradoavalanche,lxeu2zm,2024-11-16 05:05:32,Another game where Toews is bottom-3 here. Not trying to say he's the only reason we lost but the pattern continues
coloradoavalanche,lxgerok,2024-11-16 11:54:18,I was at the game and for the life of me could not figure out why Kelly Kovelenko and Wood didn't get more ice time. They were the only ones creating sustained pressure.
coloradoavalanche,lxfx6q6,2024-11-16 10:16:41,Goal tending is going to be the end of this team.  It's that simple.
coloradoavalanche,lxft4r2,2024-11-16 09:52:09,It's known he's playing with an injury that they've decided won't change it's pattern if he sat for a while but will bother him for a long time Now what that injury is who knows? No report on specifics
coloradoavalanche,lxi7ber,2024-11-16 17:44:42,skating game time for the guys that should carry the team.
coloradoavalanche,lxfy64s,2024-11-16 10:22:29,Yes I know that. The point is that playing through it doesn't seem to be working
coloradoavalanche,lxfzb70,2024-11-16 10:29:07,Worth mentioning it in your original post then other folks might not which is why I mentioned.
stlouisblues,lxu3u75,2024-11-18 18:01:03,Figured y'all would like to know that your subscriptions aren't going up as a result of the Cardinals joining the action.
stlouisblues,lxswzx6,2024-11-18 14:20:41,Thought he really moved the puck well and couple times wanted to join the rush but could tell a bit hesitant. Good positioning too. I tend to pick the D apart and honestly think he’s played fantastic.  Hope he gets more of a look!
stlouisblues,lxsxt1o,2024-11-18 14:24:44,Made some great passes
stlouisblues,lxsyzs0,2024-11-18 14:30:41,I think he’s looked really and I hope he stays up here. To this point he doesn’t look out of place and right now I’m fine with him on the 2nd pairing and moving to the 3rd pairing once we get guys back if he continues his current play.
stlouisblues,lxt0xxi,2024-11-18 14:40:33,He's looked great making good breakout passes and helping with the transition/rush game a lot. I think he's probably at his ceiling though. he's 29 with like 30 NHL games before this call up... his last one being in 22-23.
stlouisblues,lxtde9c,2024-11-18 15:43:55,Calle Rosen: 2024 edition?
stlouisblues,lxt17t9,2024-11-18 14:41:56,I think what made him stand out is his positioning and ability to effectively clear the d zone which is something we've struggled with recently.
stlouisblues,lxtmp92,2024-11-18 16:30:37,Probably a 4a player. Looks good in small amount of games but more plays in NHL more his flaws will come out
stlouisblues,lxt4jp5,2024-11-18 14:58:45,Very happy with his performance.
stlouisblues,lxtr4y9,2024-11-18 16:53:06,He's alright in small doses when we have the puck especially in the O zone. When we are stuck in the D zone he does run around a bit.
stlouisblues,lxt887o,2024-11-18 15:17:40,Put him on the powerplay. It’s shit and he’s earned it. He’s got great puck movement and he’s put some nasty passes into the slot for the offense the last couple games.
stlouisblues,lxtew1h,2024-11-18 15:51:24,So is Tucker just so far down the depth charts he needs scuba gear now?
stlouisblues,lxt28am,2024-11-18 14:47:03,Don’t know much about him. What’s his style of play?
stlouisblues,lxtpnfx,2024-11-18 16:45:36,D players tend to stand out to me when they make great plays or fuck up badly. Otherwise it’s just taking care of business.  Schueneman has stood out.  Kid’s playing really well I’d keep him in the lineup.
stlouisblues,lxtilqa,2024-11-18 16:10:03,I still think Rosen got shafted. The way he was playing he earned more ice time..
stlouisblues,lxu01ds,2024-11-18 17:40:10,That's not always the case. But given his age and the fact he hasn't played many NHL games before is proof of your statement.
stlouisblues,lxu4tmm,2024-11-18 18:06:39,Forreal though until broberg and Thomas come back what do you have to lose? Obviously the same crap you've been trying isn't working out.
stlouisblues,lxu0le1,2024-11-18 17:43:10,I think so I haven't seen him since the beginning of the season. I could see him being a physical stay at home defenseman like Trouba. But he's got too many reckless tendencies like pinching in the Ozone when it's not smart.
stlouisblues,lxu0cnx,2024-11-18 17:41:51,Hmmm. We'll he's only played a handful of games. He positions himself well skates decently pretty good at moving the puck out of the d zone and starting rushes. He's all around solid im not sure he's particularly great at any one thing though.
stlouisblues,lxtmxjb,2024-11-18 16:31:48,I’d be upset if he were a regular for the Avs right now but he’s in the AHL still.
stlouisblues,lxtzuaq,2024-11-18 17:39:07,That's fair. He's gotta be good enough to start on at least a lower tier team. Maybe that season was just an outlier? We may never know.
stlouisblues,lxsx5l4,2024-11-18 14:21:28,Good night sweet Kappy. Hope you get an opportunity somewhere else. Solid depth guy with good talent that he just never completely lives up to.
stlouisblues,lxszk2t,2024-11-18 14:33:31,Long overdue
stlouisblues,lxt31bd,2024-11-18 14:51:07,For his cap hit someone might give him a shot. I wouldn't be surprised to see him contribute elsewhere. That last two months when he and Vrana came in and were both playing close to a PPG pace was wild.
stlouisblues,lxta14m,2024-11-18 15:26:53,Understand the move but disappointed that he couldn't find a way to contribute more. Seems like he has a really good skill set but you only see brief glimpses of it.
stlouisblues,lxtagcf,2024-11-18 15:29:02,Seems like the type of player to get claimed and then shipped at the deadline if he played well.San Jose Columbus Chicago
stlouisblues,lxsxc00,2024-11-18 14:22:22,Very fast and... that was kinda it. I wouldn't be sad to see him back sometime if he clears.
stlouisblues,lxt1nop,2024-11-18 14:44:09,Oh no! Anyway …
stlouisblues,lxt190o,2024-11-18 14:42:06,![gif](giphy|J8FZIm9VoBU6Q)
stlouisblues,lxt7ptd,2024-11-18 15:15:02,Thank god. I was hoping we would get rid of him. He doesn't do anything. This news makes me so happy.
stlouisblues,lxtni9a,2024-11-18 16:34:45,I liked having him in STL. Became a favorite of mine quickly. I don't think he showed his talent enough. Maybe he isn't as talented as I'd hoped. Either way maybe he'll get an opportunity somewhere else. Good luck to him but he isn't a piece of the Blues puzzle.
stlouisblues,lxtumiv,2024-11-18 17:11:10,Best of luck and hopefully he gets a chance somewhere else. I don’t get the hate he gets. He works his ass off he just wasn’t great overall. He’s replaceable but He filled a hole in the lineup when we needed it. He was a waiver addition so we lost nothing and he had 0 expectations.
stlouisblues,lxtakds,2024-11-18 15:29:36,The guy was usually in the right spot to score but just wiffed it wide too often
stlouisblues,lxt4ry6,2024-11-18 14:59:53,Did we need to send him down to make room for someone??
stlouisblues,lxtq01w,2024-11-18 16:47:22,Not Cheeks Klappanen!
stlouisblues,lxu0i6c,2024-11-18 17:42:41,I really liked Kapanen some nights. I think he’s a really great guy too and I hope he’s able to make it work somewhere if they take him.
stlouisblues,lxu2poc,2024-11-18 17:54:46,https://preview.redd.it/6pfsnc8hpq1e1.jpeg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a81a9155047523255463675a9bcae6c3d64d2a7
stlouisblues,lxtfqha,2024-11-18 15:55:37,Not related but how dare he wear 42?
stlouisblues,lxu0ncd,2024-11-18 17:43:27,And ownership I think gambled a bit too hard that it would continue. Same with Blais
stlouisblues,lxu7rdl,2024-11-18 18:23:37,If you cant find a way to contribute with this roster you might be cooked tbh
stlouisblues,lxtrhkm,2024-11-18 16:54:52,Kap is great and impressive... right up until the time comes to cap a play. He just can't finish the job. Which is weird because he has a very lively shot.
stlouisblues,lxtnqjs,2024-11-18 16:35:55,You're talking about Buch right?
stlouisblues,lxtazv0,2024-11-18 15:31:48,Thomas hopefully 
stlouisblues,lxtrtk4,2024-11-18 16:56:34,"I've got faith Bunch can find that scoring touch again. He's overthinking it at center right now. Kappy was the ""he has it every once in awhile"". Buch is the opposite usually. This season feels like an outlier."
stlouisblues,lxs2rjo,2024-11-18 11:48:55,We can’t lose today!
stlouisblues,lxsd7pu,2024-11-18 12:41:39,Pardon the prospect recap delay from yesterday I was too annoyed to think about hockey. Only a couple of games last night anyway.\- **Antoine Dorion** snapped a six-game goal and point drought in Quebec's 4-3 loss. It was a bounceback game all around for the center who won 12 of 22 draws and was a plus (+1 to be exact) for the first time since October 6th.The goal: [https://youtu.be/smSYwMtR\_r4?si=xOxW-5sfsIyPZ8CH&t=43](https://youtu.be/smSYwMtR_r4?si=xOxW-5sfsIyPZ8CH&t=43)\- **Matthew Mayich** had an assist two shots and a -1 as Ottawa 67s scored a seesaw 4-3 win.No prospects in action today.
stlouisblues,lxtxs3p,2024-11-18 17:28:03,Friedman on today’s 32 thoughts: Columbus will likely resolve David Jirichek in the next few days.  He’s been scratched along with watching Dante Fabbro step in ahead of him on Columbus’ depth chart. A trade seems like a very likely outcome.  I’d say there’s a real non 0 chance we’d be involved. Columbus is in the other division and we drafted the guys brother he fits our age window. I’ve got absolutely no idea if it’s a good idea or not. I just try to predict things. Seems like it’s one to look out for.
stlouisblues,lxrqwyw,2024-11-18 10:47:09,Let’s go boys; bounce back and play hard against the Wild this Tuesday.
stlouisblues,lxu5tk3,2024-11-18 18:12:24,Agreed the talks have been getting more and more aggressive each week from Friedman about Jiricek I think he's a huge boost to our prospect pool depending on the cost. It will also depend on how conversations with him would go since it seems part of his issue is he doesn't want to play in the A even if me might need to still. I think we're in a good spot that he's an obvious upgrade over kessel and can start out sheltered and then be given more minutes as he finds his game (ala Scotty P)
stlouisblues,lxoon5w,2024-11-17 20:16:36,Blues are a little like your 95-year-old grandma with dementia who gets super lucid for 15 minutes now and then and then goes back to forgetting who you are.
stlouisblues,lxok6po,2024-11-17 19:49:35,We’ll be fine just gotta win 5 straight and we’ll be right back in the playoff race.
stlouisblues,lxoilz2,2024-11-17 19:40:13,https://preview.redd.it/wisjg1oc3k1e1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d83c0e486e544df2b3f2d3f38f88a98a45f9975dPorter Martone might be nice.
stlouisblues,lxoie5f,2024-11-17 19:38:56,Top 5 pick if we keep bannister. We’re gonna be cookin 
stlouisblues,lxp99df,2024-11-17 22:25:19,Back to our regularly scheduled sadness….
stlouisblues,lxolh6v,2024-11-17 19:57:20,Play 60
stlouisblues,lxoi41e,2024-11-17 19:37:17,It wouldn’t be so bad if we had some real effort out there. You tell me how 5 grown professional athletes have 0 shot *attempts* on a powerplay. I’d bag them all at practice.
stlouisblues,lxoi4qr,2024-11-17 19:37:24,This is exactly what I'm talking about. It wasn't 8-1 but we just came up short. The talent isn't there whether that be coaching or on the ice. Sucks to not look great but hey hopefully we can get a good pick this year and keep our eyes towards the horizon. LGB!
stlouisblues,lxoibuq,2024-11-17 19:38:34,We get bodied by marquee players and Necas is turning into one.  Oh well; on to the next one.  I’ll be there Tuesday hoping we bounce back.
stlouisblues,lxojp0p,2024-11-17 19:46:40,Caveat: didn't watch the game and it might get me lambasted here...but is Hofer not the game-stealing goalie we need down the road?Upside is he's young I think and can develop.Am I just letting the bummer of Blues losing games get to me and looking for a scapegoat? I just haven't been super impressed by Hofer this season so far.But not everyone can be Binnington I know.
stlouisblues,lxoi3cf,2024-11-17 19:37:11,The hole is getting bigger and bigger……
stlouisblues,lxoitw2,2024-11-17 19:41:33,These “retool” years are a lot less fun to watch without Panger. I know he had enormous shoes to fill but Rivers + this on ice product is a tough watch a lot of nights.
stlouisblues,lxrayku,2024-11-18 09:15:17,I hate it when the St. Louis Blues lose hockey games.
stlouisblues,lxot94x,2024-11-17 20:44:53,Blues really should just go out and get a second line center at this point. I think this team could actually contend fully healthy with a solid #2 if Buchy moved backed to the wing and returned to form. Kyrou looks really good our defense has actually markedly improved since the last two years and it seems like our possession has as well. I know a top five pick would be great but we all know that’s not happening. Thomas is going to come back and the team is going to claw back and make it close we are not in that blackhawks/San Jose/anaheim/montreal/pittsburgh tier of bad. I think we need to go for it just a little bit more otherwise we are sort of just wasting kyrou / Thomas’ prime years and the rest of paraykos pseudo #1D pairing years (and having them is the whole point of doing a retool instead of a full on rebuild) Curious what others think. I know it’s not gonna happen but ROR would be great and is in a good age as a dvorsky stop gap which others on here have floated.
stlouisblues,lxoiahr,2024-11-17 19:38:21,https://preview.redd.it/907rghf13k1e1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58c7472cbe99bfd0e4f2f7ed008313ed02dff88d
stlouisblues,lxohwob,2024-11-17 19:36:06,Sick.
stlouisblues,lxsrrm7,2024-11-18 13:54:33,Special teams need big time work the team is decimated by injuries and we lack a solid we don't have a true 1st line imo. We really need Rob Thom and Broberg back..
stlouisblues,lxoltz1,2024-11-17 19:59:29,Easy peasy
stlouisblues,lxojagb,2024-11-17 19:44:19,Frondell or misa in that spot imo.
stlouisblues,lxoiqtt,2024-11-17 19:41:02,Go for best Available. Hopefully we get Hagens.
stlouisblues,lxoihr3,2024-11-17 19:39:32,Is it against the Leafs? If not it isn't looking good lol.
stlouisblues,lxomut2,2024-11-17 20:05:41,Goalies almost always take a long time to develop much longer than other positions. They’re usually 2627 before they are really ready so I’m not concerned. This is another reason they won’t trade Binner because Hofer still has a lot to learn and Binn can definitely help him.
stlouisblues,lxokju7,2024-11-17 19:51:46,I honestly think he’s been fine. Even the trash blowout game - the entire team was not really competitive. It isn’t like the team is being let down by goaltending from how I see it. I think the current score is more indicative of the clubs LHD depth chart having 5 simultaneous injuries than the goalies.
stlouisblues,lxoqz2y,2024-11-17 20:30:53,I was at the game. He just needs more development and a defense that will help him out a bit more
stlouisblues,lxol1gc,2024-11-17 19:54:42,Honestly agree I think he’s looked particularly bad this season. But I’m not completely writing him off yet bc of how bad the defense is. 
stlouisblues,lxoly7y,2024-11-17 20:00:12,Hes had a bit of a rough start. Gotta be patient with young goalies
stlouisblues,lxokxvt,2024-11-17 19:54:06,That’s a tough one
stlouisblues,lxol150,2024-11-17 19:54:39,"I think Rivers is dangerously close to the ""obnoxious homer"" announcer. I get that you have to play the team up but when you start calling for penalties to not be called when they're down late or every other penalty is a lucky break I start rolling my eyes."
stlouisblues,lxoocjm,2024-11-17 20:14:47,OMG i know right. I watched the Hawks game last night just to hear Panger. Rivers is good on 101 in that sports talk format but the homer excuses he makes for the Blues play during a game is just obnoxious.
stlouisblues,lxomer9,2024-11-17 20:02:58,I've got this wild scenario in my mind where one of these trips I make to Chicago I run into Panger I tell him how much he means to Blues broadcasting and me as a fan of the game. He's a big part of the reason I'm a die hard hockey fan these days - through enjoying his game calling - and in my mind it convinces him to drop everything and move back to STL and ride out the rest of his career bringing joy and happiness to Bluesbros everywhere.
stlouisblues,lxstpzo,2024-11-18 14:04:19,Win or lose they are my blues.. but man I hope they win
stlouisblues,lxoy4ks,2024-11-17 21:14:58,And where will you find said 2C sir?
stlouisblues,lxs1d5f,2024-11-18 11:41:51,A 2C doesn't make this team a contender. It takes it closer to a playoff spot but it doesn't make them pass Winnipeg Colorado Dallas or Minnesota. You're also competing with around 15 other teams looking for a legitimate 2C to their roster and you still have the timebomb of Faulk/Parayko aging out without similar or better players to replace them.
stlouisblues,lxp2vi5,2024-11-17 21:44:25,I’d like it. I don’t think I love the market or the price we’d have to pay. Therefore I’m scared of it happening.I think there’s 3 categories:Old dude with 1 year left on bad team that costs very little. (Not many of these left after Eller)Youngish dude or oldish dude with flaw in game but some high upside that costs something we don’t want to pay.(Kadri?) Or 23/24 year old 1st round pedigree (to match other prospects we’ve accumulated) that costs a lot. (Seth Jarvis? Dylan Cozens? These teams don’t wanna trade these fellows and it would take a giant bite out of some of the nice things we have to encourage them to)
stlouisblues,lxojfoj,2024-11-17 19:45:09,Frondell is 100% a Doug Armstrong pick
stlouisblues,lxoiwfr,2024-11-17 19:41:58,I like martone a lot Hagens is going 1OA almost certainly
stlouisblues,lxoiu8e,2024-11-17 19:41:36,Hagens could turn this franchise around
stlouisblues,lxojbor,2024-11-17 19:44:31,No more leafs games unless we make the cup final this year
stlouisblues,lxoimep,2024-11-17 19:40:17,Nah we got Wild and Sharks this week
stlouisblues,lxolgq0,2024-11-17 19:57:16,Hofer basically had the same save percentage than Binnington in that trash blowout game against Ottawa….both goalies got hosed by the “team” in front of them though so no fault to either.
stlouisblues,lxolaew,2024-11-17 19:56:12,For sure. I'd never put the losses on Hofer. I've just been wishing for some outrageous game stealing - again I think that's just the reckless optimism wanting to get out paired with being spoiled by Binnington when he goes godmode.
stlouisblues,lxp9v1q,2024-11-17 22:29:16,Rivers is a homer. He’s also not very smart. No clue why this guy is on TV or the radio
stlouisblues,lxp2y0w,2024-11-17 21:44:51,Costco?
stlouisblues,lxp1hqy,2024-11-17 21:35:53,What assets will we be spending?
stlouisblues,lxppmgk,2024-11-18 00:24:04,I like the old dude idea. Just give structure for the youth to step in and don't hamstring the team longterm.  1 ROR please and thanks
stlouisblues,lxoq3gn,2024-11-17 20:25:30,He would fit right in with the rest of the St. Louis Swedes
stlouisblues,lxoj818,2024-11-17 19:43:54,I’m manifesting a 1OA for the blues this year. 
stlouisblues,lxp7tla,2024-11-17 22:15:53,I honestly would not consider any of the blues’ prospects untouchable depending on who the target is and if that person is in the Thomas/kyrou window of contention. Would trade next years first if it’s top 10 protected. Think of how much better this team would look if Army had pulled the trigger and pulled the trigger on Necas with him and Thomas down the middle we would be set. Right now we are just praying that a couple of our prospects (mostly dvorsky and snuggerud) hit.  Huge risk associated with that and even if they do have success in the league they’re probably 3-4 years out from once they’re in the nhl before they’re at the level we need to contend. Very rarely nowadays do prospects step into the nhl ready from the jump. Not sure what the front office is thinking but based on how the roster is constructed and they way the retool is going it seems like they feel we’re a one top 6 center one top 6 winger and I guess one top 4 d away from competing (but I bet based on the 21-22 playoff run they believe we can compete with the D as is especially now with Broberg in the mix). If you’re able to fill some of these holes now via trade why not do so?
stlouisblues,lxro4p3,2024-11-18 10:32:09,If I’m allowed to dream:  99 set the standard - why shouldn’t St. Louis be a stop for all generational talent.   Sidney Crosby come on down.  Snuggerud Dean Perunovich our 1st and 5th for 1 Sidney Crosby please. Comparable to Gretzky. Instant contender.
stlouisblues,lxstmdx,2024-11-18 14:03:48,I feel like recent drafts have Steen's fingerprints all over them.
stlouisblues,lxop7rf,2024-11-17 20:20:06,Trade Suter Saad and Leddy at the deadline if he waives and we might have a good shot at 1OA
stlouisblues,lxp9mrm,2024-11-17 22:27:44,This is a bottom ten D in the league even if Broberg maintains his level of play and they are also old as hell. This team could contend for an 8 seed with a 2C but that is it 
stlouisblues,lxssl4b,2024-11-18 13:58:34,God no. First off didn't Sid just get an extension? Secondly I doubt he leaves pittsburgh. Third why would we trade Snug?
stlouisblues,lxr75aw,2024-11-18 08:50:53,I tend to agree all I’m saying is that it’s basically the same back end that we had in ‘22 which the front office I think perceives as being strong enough to contend. With the addition of suter and broberg and the strong play of perunovichwere actually doing a much better job of pushing the puck up the ice which has been a problem for us since petrol/bouw left.
stlouisblues,lxssrr0,2024-11-18 13:59:29,Fourth he's old as dirt. He's obviously still super productive but there's no way he stays at this level the rest of his career.
stlouisblues,lxst6ak,2024-11-18 14:01:31,Kyrou mirrors Geuntzel’s game quite a bit and a top 6 attack with Crosby Thomas would be best in central. You’d have to give a gem. I don’t want to trade anybody but that’s what it would cost. Or if not that it would be something of substance that was painful.  It would be fun. St. Louis would become a must watch team league wide.  It wouldn’t be the first time it has happened. It’s probably more likely I’m struck by lightning but damn it would be a good maneuver for the short term. The thought of Buchnevich and Crosby on the ice together is sick too. They both are hounds and smart. 
stlouisblues,lxnph21,2024-11-17 16:53:28,Congratulations on being the first one to the rink.
stlouisblues,lxnm1wo,2024-11-17 16:34:45,I couldn’t find anyone to cover me at work or I’d be there too! LGB

stlouisblues,lxr5vbc,2024-11-18 08:42:33,Some thoughts:Lenovo Center is really nice. The upper deck seats are really narrow but not too much. I did see a Canes fan try to jump up after a goal but get stopped by the arm rest. The storm siren is really coolTheir power play thing is dumb and annoying it’s perfect. Ryan Suter is the most visible defenseman on the Blues for the worst reasons.
stlouisblues,lxnqekq,2024-11-17 16:58:31,And like most nights with this team he’s shown up before they do.
stlouisblues,lxnu2by,2024-11-17 17:18:51,Not today.

stlouisblues,lxmgygj,2024-11-17 12:55:34,There's a bobble head promo on Dec 15th with the player in the WC jersey so sometime before then for sure.
stlouisblues,lxm5czz,2024-11-17 11:51:16,I looked up the jersey reveal for the 2022 Winter classic and it was September 13th so they are really late this time. I wonder what's taking so long.
stlouisblues,lxmcpk6,2024-11-17 12:32:04,Probably waiting another couple weeks to see if we'll even have enough healthy players to play.
stlouisblues,lxno8vt,2024-11-17 16:46:44,Have you seen how the team is doing. They aren't playing well enough to justify the price.

stlouisblues,lxn6l2l,2024-11-17 15:12:07,I wonder if it’s a fanatics supply issue. They’re probably behind from getting all of the Merch for the season‘s new uniforms for every team caught back up that sales of the new winter classic stuff wouldn’t be ready until later.
stlouisblues,lxq1na5,2024-11-18 02:17:20,This certainly seems like part of it.Also with the September reveal I'm of the mind that they did it that early to kind of stoke the money fires after covid sapped a bunch of income from the industry. Plus they were sitting on those a whole extra year since covid canceled the 2021 WC they were supposed to originally play in and with it being Blues night at Busch Stadium kind of made it a no brainer with the above in mind.I'm thinking we'll get a social media teaser this week and then a full reveal right before Thanksgiving next week with an on-sale date set for Black Friday.
stlouisblues,lxnwep6,2024-11-17 17:31:48,Kyrou is a different player. Watching him hustle into defensive positions and recover pucks is incredible.
stlouisblues,lxo6mm8,2024-11-17 18:30:55,Buch has gotten really bad at turning the puck over it really bad places.
stlouisblues,lxo72ig,2024-11-17 18:33:35,Don’t worry in the 3rd we will nearly get a goal
stlouisblues,lxnu3g5,2024-11-17 17:19:00,ROUZY A DOG ON THAT SHIFT
stlouisblues,lxnwjng,2024-11-17 17:32:33,God Scotty P keeps looking more and more confident since his goal. I love it. They better keep giving him chances
stlouisblues,lxo40sd,2024-11-17 18:15:37,Give Sunny an Oscar for that one lmao. He sold that hard.
stlouisblues,lxnzi5n,2024-11-17 17:49:27,We gotta get Buchy back on wing when Thomas gets back.  We are wasting him at center.
stlouisblues,lxo57hd,2024-11-17 18:22:35,Update on previous story: The St Louis Blues do in fact hate sick children
stlouisblues,lxo6mx0,2024-11-17 18:30:58,I’m really starting to question why I keep turning these games on to watch them when this is the effort we’ve gotten on a nightly basis for weeks
stlouisblues,lxo848s,2024-11-17 18:39:44,we're not even getting Corsi'd they're just burying their chances and limiting ours.
stlouisblues,lxnu290,2024-11-17 17:18:50,That was so filthy omfg. That whole sequence.
stlouisblues,lxnu30m,2024-11-17 17:18:57,tremendous forecheck by Kyrou there
stlouisblues,lxnu4cz,2024-11-17 17:19:08,Kyrou what a fucking play
stlouisblues,lxnubrf,2024-11-17 17:20:15,that was some beautiful stick work from kyrou goddamn
stlouisblues,lxnx5is,2024-11-17 17:35:59,Hofer looks tuned in today.
stlouisblues,lxo6imd,2024-11-17 18:30:15,This is the angriest I've ever been hearing boot scoot boogie
stlouisblues,lxo8l4z,2024-11-17 18:42:26,Very poor period
stlouisblues,lxm4sxn,2024-11-17 11:48:12,Reckless optimism: we beat Carolina last month at homeRealism: we have several key players injuredIs 11am too early to start drinking?
stlouisblues,lxma6g5,2024-11-17 12:18:01,PHIL COLLINS; SEND HOFER YOUR ENERGYhttps://preview.redd.it/qkswm3vgwh1e1.jpeg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c170ec55a4dd0183a0084c5470f11afd681f00b6
stlouisblues,lxnu2h3,2024-11-17 17:18:52,First line building some chemistry
stlouisblues,lxnu2la,2024-11-17 17:18:53,That was beautiful 
stlouisblues,lxnu38d,2024-11-17 17:18:59,Kyrou fighting for that puck
stlouisblues,lxnu4co,2024-11-17 17:19:08,Wait a minute you’re telling me this team can actually make clean passes? 
stlouisblues,lxnu5bn,2024-11-17 17:19:17,Wow.  Just played yesterday and now playing against a very good Canes team yeah that goal was great but its been because of the awesome effort so far.  If they play a full 60 g'damn the Blues have some compete
stlouisblues,lxnvkeu,2024-11-17 17:27:07,Walker with some razzle dazzle there LOL
stlouisblues,lxnw8h4,2024-11-17 17:30:50,Schenn Clear the Zone Challenge: Impossible
stlouisblues,lxo5x1i,2024-11-17 18:26:43,Man all that good work in the first and then right back to bumbling in the second. 
stlouisblues,lxo6ji9,2024-11-17 18:30:24,A bad bounce and it lands right at the feet of the hottest guy in the league.Just not our night.
stlouisblues,lxo8jjx,2024-11-17 18:42:11,Second period was quite painful.
stlouisblues,lxogomq,2024-11-17 19:28:58,Bannister must be a boomer blues fan because he has a massive boner playing the checking lines more than the skill lines.
stlouisblues,lxn4q8k,2024-11-17 15:02:03,Just a little reckless optimism here but they’re somehow right back in the wildcard race with a win here. 
stlouisblues,lxnteth,2024-11-17 17:15:12,I fucking love Jordan Kyrou.
stlouisblues,lxntgkw,2024-11-17 17:15:29,God Kyrou is FAST AF
stlouisblues,lxntzue,2024-11-17 17:18:27,#ROUZY TO JAKEY LETS GO
stlouisblues,lxnu1sq,2024-11-17 17:18:46,JAKEY BOYS DONE IT AGAIN!!! ***BLUESSSS GOAL!!!!!!!***
stlouisblues,lxnu2bk,2024-11-17 17:18:51,Who is this team!?
stlouisblues,lxnu5n1,2024-11-17 17:19:20,Carolina looks hungover in the early going here
stlouisblues,lxnvin1,2024-11-17 17:26:51,What a setup by top cunt
stlouisblues,lxnvyv6,2024-11-17 17:29:22,Nate Walk casually turning into Datsyuk was not on my bingo card
stlouisblues,lxnw847,2024-11-17 17:30:47,Kyrou just pinned a man to the boards fuck yeah
stlouisblues,lxnwbub,2024-11-17 17:31:21,FFS Buch Mitts coulda had a breakaway. Focus!!
stlouisblues,lxnxtby,2024-11-17 17:39:48,Sunny been taking lots of penalties recently O_o
stlouisblues,lxo51ll,2024-11-17 18:21:37,We didn’t shoot the puck on a power play. It’s like air balling both free throw attempts.
stlouisblues,lxo71vr,2024-11-17 18:33:28,They gave up; I’m turning this shit off; every time it’s 3 to 1 they just fucking give up
stlouisblues,lxoewfa,2024-11-17 19:19:01,There's no reason Kyrou should be down in 8th in minutes played. That's nuts.
stlouisblues,lxohpna,2024-11-17 19:34:57,Rivers still acting like they have any chance of coming back
stlouisblues,lxmgnt5,2024-11-17 12:53:57,The prospect recaps start early today.\- From what I can tell Ivan Vorobyov left Vityaz's 7-1 destruction of Sunday hosts Severstal (seriously it was uuuugly) with some sort of injury. Before he departed the game early in the 2nd Vorobyov had chalked up two primary rush assists 1 SOG and 1 hit. With two Ws in their last three Vityaz are now within three points of the last playoff slot in their conference.\- Matvei Korotky helped set up the first goal of the game as SKA-1946 eked out a seesaw 4-3 win the team's fourth W in a row. He was on for two goals and for two against had 3 SOG and won 15 of 22 draws in 17:18 of ice time (one second less than the top SKA forward in this game.Prospects in action later today: Mayich Dorion.
stlouisblues,lxntce0,2024-11-17 17:14:48,Kyrou is getting one tonight
stlouisblues,lxntjz3,2024-11-17 17:16:00,I mean he was getting pushed the whole time Saad couldn't really do much there
stlouisblues,lxnu6jf,2024-11-17 17:19:28,Rouzy haters stand up!!
stlouisblues,lxnu8o5,2024-11-17 17:19:48,Ummm so what time does Carolina show up? Blues dominating Jakey makes it count with a SORELY NEEDED goal. LFG.
stlouisblues,lxnvicf,2024-11-17 17:26:49,All that cus Schenn couldn’t clear the zone. It’s the little things that add up
stlouisblues,lxnwrlc,2024-11-17 17:33:47,The effort level and persistence in checking in all 3 zones is phenomenal these past few games.
stlouisblues,lxnx6ep,2024-11-17 17:36:07,BLUES HAVE SCORED FIRST GOAL IN FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES!?
stlouisblues,lxo3pu8,2024-11-17 18:13:49,This team just love icing the puck?
stlouisblues,lxo41y7,2024-11-17 18:15:49,Schueneman has been making some great forward passes and even crazier ones into the slot for our offense. It’s a damn shame none of them have capitalized but it’s hard not to notice the efforts he’s been making. He’s been quietly good at defense too. Stick him on the second power play unit fuck it.
stlouisblues,lxo4552,2024-11-17 18:16:21,What do the St Louis Blues have to say about the allegations that they hate sick children?
stlouisblues,lxo4s5s,2024-11-17 18:20:06,Our PP is such a joke. It’s so frustrating
stlouisblues,lxo4sja,2024-11-17 18:20:10,Our power play is horrific.
stlouisblues,lxo4zdw,2024-11-17 18:21:17,Every time Hofer leaves the crease I feel sicky icky in my tumtum
stlouisblues,lxo5193,2024-11-17 18:21:34,The Bannister-Ott power play Era is amazing
stlouisblues,lxo6ekm,2024-11-17 18:29:35,Four of our guys on the backcheck and not a single one picking up an open man is wild.
stlouisblues,lxoefqr,2024-11-17 19:16:28,The Tex-sunny-Joseph line has been horrible
stlouisblues,lxofhge,2024-11-17 19:22:19,Texier getting more ice time is not the answer give Kyrou and neighbours more ice team. Give schenn and Saad more ice time
stlouisblues,lxofn3o,2024-11-17 19:23:13,Has he benched Kyrou???
stlouisblues,lxofqju,2024-11-17 19:23:46,Four straight bottom 6 lines. WTF is he doing???
stlouisblues,lxnvoh1,2024-11-17 17:27:45,Walker has become a REALLY good player especially in a league hellbent on finding the tallest giants around.  Great shots finishes EVERY hit super high value 4th liner
stlouisblues,lxn5cjo,2024-11-17 15:05:23,We're both on game 2 of a Back to Back tonight. Carolina had a much later game than us but it was also a home game for them.
stlouisblues,lxn6l1g,2024-11-17 15:12:07,NO BALDUC?!
stlouisblues,lxna4oo,2024-11-17 15:31:08,Blech another early weekend game. It's not that I *want* to turn the game off in disgust I would just like the *opportunity* to do so.
stlouisblues,lxnu1ux,2024-11-17 17:18:46,Holy shit
stlouisblues,lxnu299,2024-11-17 17:18:50,Let's fucking go!
stlouisblues,lxnumqe,2024-11-17 17:21:55,We couldn’t ask for a better start. We’re doing a fantastic job of maintaining puck possession right now.
stlouisblues,lxnvmqf,2024-11-17 17:27:28,26 out there looking like 25 for a sec lmao
stlouisblues,lxnwrzq,2024-11-17 17:33:51,Look at big 55 crashing the net right before the break. I love it so much
stlouisblues,lxnxinm,2024-11-17 17:38:06,Get ya Rouzy Selke votes here(ignore the turnover)
stlouisblues,lxo11kc,2024-11-17 17:58:19,***Reckless. Optimism.***
stlouisblues,lxo2kz4,2024-11-17 18:07:09,COME ON KYROU LETS GET ONE
stlouisblues,lxo3e3a,2024-11-17 18:11:53,Is it just me or did Faulk get just enough of a stick on that pass?
stlouisblues,lxo3y9h,2024-11-17 18:15:13,Lol sunny
stlouisblues,lxo4myy,2024-11-17 18:19:16,Too much pass not enough shoot
stlouisblues,lxo4tr7,2024-11-17 18:20:22,I’m so glad we give pp1 the entire time
stlouisblues,lxo4u6c,2024-11-17 18:20:26,Wow not a single shot attempt.
stlouisblues,lxo4wg7,2024-11-17 18:20:48,How do you have like 90 seconds of PP zone time and generate 0 shot **attempts**???? That's embarassingly bad.
stlouisblues,lxo4x75,2024-11-17 18:20:56,That was a PPPP. Piss-poor power play.
stlouisblues,lxo520a,2024-11-17 18:21:41,Our PP is poopoo
stlouisblues,lxo6f8y,2024-11-17 18:29:42,Excuse me while I cry
stlouisblues,lxo6ufw,2024-11-17 18:32:14,Why are we the kings of turning an offensive zone face off into goal against
stlouisblues,lxo748p,2024-11-17 18:33:52,You have to shoot high on this guy he’s very good and taking away the 5-hole
stlouisblues,lxodf2z,2024-11-17 19:10:32,That was a lazy careless penalty
stlouisblues,lxodj5s,2024-11-17 19:11:11,A nightmare shift by Joseph. He turns back at our line for some bizarre reason when we had numbers going forward then he flings it into the sun when he had a teammate open ahead. He does not look fit yet.
stlouisblues,lxodpx9,2024-11-17 19:12:18,There are *far* too many players on this roster whose first instinct under pressure is to just throw away the puck into a 50/50 instead of trying to extend plays
stlouisblues,lxogiqc,2024-11-17 19:28:04,3 passes in a row where they struggle to handle it.  They have a keg hiding behind the bench or do they just never practice? Can't say they're tired Carolina played late last night and are doing fine
stlouisblues,lxoh0jm,2024-11-17 19:30:52,Well at least we don’t have to worry about pulling the goalie
stlouisblues,lxoh0wp,2024-11-17 19:30:56,GOD I LOVE BLUES ICING
stlouisblues,lxo8e9z,2024-11-17 18:41:20,This is one of those games where you need a fired up coach getting everyone’s head back in the game and I just don’t see that happening
stlouisblues,lxls2wu,2024-11-17 10:37:05,This will be a tough one. The Canes are legit and were asking Suter and parayko to play almost 55 minutes of heavy defensive shifts in one 28 hour stretch. I'm hoping for a not-embarassment.
stlouisblues,lxo7ehv,2024-11-17 18:35:34,Another great pass to the canes by Buchy
stlouisblues,lxofj04,2024-11-17 19:22:34,Here we go with all the checking lines when we need a goal now. Bannister is a clown.
stlouisblues,lxm6ym7,2024-11-17 12:00:05,Anybody know what's going on with Jiricek? He played 4 games in the O and hasn't played in like 2 weeks
stlouisblues,lxnrdia,2024-11-17 17:03:54,The odds are not in our favor. But they rarely are LGB
stlouisblues,lxnrktj,2024-11-17 17:05:01,Let’s see how Hof does today it’s been awhile since he’s played.
stlouisblues,lxnsf7z,2024-11-17 17:09:40,Hofer has had some slow starts.. can’t do that against the canes
stlouisblues,lxnsl3b,2024-11-17 17:10:34,"Not related to this game but it's hilarious that the Florida crowd was chanting ""overrated"" at the Jets. I've been thinking it seems like everyone forgets they always seem to start strong (although they've started very strong right now) and then fall off in January onward. I've been predicting the same but we'll see"
stlouisblues,lxnu2c3,2024-11-17 17:18:51,Jacky!!!
stlouisblues,lxnugvw,2024-11-17 17:21:02,Man that's a good goal
stlouisblues,lxnuhn9,2024-11-17 17:21:09,KYROU USING THAT SPEED FOR SOME FILTHY SETUPS
stlouisblues,lxnur8o,2024-11-17 17:22:36, Coming out and outshooting them 6-0?! I like!
stlouisblues,lxnv9zu,2024-11-17 17:25:30,Buch needs to remember a shot for a rebound can be as good as a pass.
stlouisblues,lxnvenp,2024-11-17 17:26:14,Buch has been rough at passing overall this season
stlouisblues,lxnvnhj,2024-11-17 17:27:35,That deserved a goal. Nice save asshole.
stlouisblues,lxnxegy,2024-11-17 17:37:26,Another instance of not clearing the zone leading to us getting hemmed in
stlouisblues,lxnxvp5,2024-11-17 17:40:11,Joseph does not look right to me the last two games since coming back he doesn't have his usual burst and swashbuckling presence.
stlouisblues,lxnxyyp,2024-11-17 17:40:42,That seemed like an unnecessary penalty to take there Sunny.
stlouisblues,lxny56h,2024-11-17 17:41:42,Hmm. That was certainly a call.
stlouisblues,lxnyayy,2024-11-17 17:42:37,That'll happen when you take dumb penalties
stlouisblues,lxnycf0,2024-11-17 17:42:51,We had the best 1st period of the season up until the last 24.8 seconds lol
stlouisblues,lxnyd8c,2024-11-17 17:42:58,What in the actual fuck was that defense? Literally no one even moved.
stlouisblues,lxnydev,2024-11-17 17:43:00,Whack pen call = PP goal. Where the fuck was Suter????
stlouisblues,lxnyjbc,2024-11-17 17:43:57,Any reason Svechnikov has room to breathe out there after our last game with the Canes?
stlouisblues,lxnyjkg,2024-11-17 17:44:00,Suter can’t leave that man there
stlouisblues,lxnyk79,2024-11-17 17:44:05,![gif](giphy|11zTEl7fbwml68)
stlouisblues,lxo0ubr,2024-11-17 17:57:10,We had 7 D zone turnovers in that period and I will guarantee you they all happened in the last 5-6 minutes of the period.
stlouisblues,lxo1y7q,2024-11-17 18:03:29,That’s on Hofer
stlouisblues,lxo2hpv,2024-11-17 18:06:36,Yeah Kyrou’s gonna put one in tonight.
stlouisblues,lxo2j5g,2024-11-17 18:06:51,Kyrou please just shoot that… with the shot you have there’s no excuse for that.
stlouisblues,lxo2kq3,2024-11-17 18:07:06,Gotta snipe it there
stlouisblues,lxo2u49,2024-11-17 18:08:37,This lack of clears is causing me pain
stlouisblues,lxo43xb,2024-11-17 18:16:08,PLEASE GOD LET IT APPEAR LIKE WE HAVE AN EXTRA GUY ON THE ICE
stlouisblues,lxo4apc,2024-11-17 18:17:15,Weak call in our favor. Let's take advantage for once.
stlouisblues,lxo4b5x,2024-11-17 18:17:20,THINK OF THE CHILDREN; THEY NEED A GOAL 
stlouisblues,lxo4iaz,2024-11-17 18:18:30,SAVE THE BABIES BLUES
stlouisblues,lxo4njt,2024-11-17 18:19:22,You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
stlouisblues,lxo4pdf,2024-11-17 18:19:39,They pass way to slow on the pp
stlouisblues,lxo4uyj,2024-11-17 18:20:34,That pp was embarrassing
stlouisblues,lxo4wuw,2024-11-17 18:20:52,That’s just a pathetic pp
stlouisblues,lxo5rg4,2024-11-17 18:25:50,They overthink on the pp instead of just playing which makes them so predictable to defend. They also don’t move their feet without the puck which also makes it very easy to defend.
stlouisblues,lxo67mm,2024-11-17 18:28:26,Pathetic
stlouisblues,lxo68nv,2024-11-17 18:28:36,Jfc we are so bad.
stlouisblues,lxo69hf,2024-11-17 18:28:44,What the fuck is even happening?! How does that get to the point where it’s right in front of the net? Zero awareness on this line I swear.
stlouisblues,lxoc74l,2024-11-17 19:03:32,Bold of the Blues organization to assume I have 10 friends
stlouisblues,lxod5br,2024-11-17 19:09:01,This shit hurts to watch not looking good tonight.
stlouisblues,lxods8v,2024-11-17 19:12:40,I'm ready for a Torp shorty.
stlouisblues,lxoeg3r,2024-11-17 19:16:32,Can’t pass can’t receive passes…
stlouisblues,lxofemx,2024-11-17 19:21:53,While there's about 30 defensive breakdowns the Blues are finally getting their SOG way up but Kochetkov is on fire tonight
stlouisblues,lxogvs0,2024-11-17 19:30:06,Cooked
stlouisblues,lxohl4m,2024-11-17 19:34:13,Wait til JanuaryFire bannister ?????Win cup
stlouisblues,lxohmv5,2024-11-17 19:34:29,Welp we were excellent for 14 minutes. The other 46...
stlouisblues,lxoa9lu,2024-11-17 18:52:17,The Blues must be pregnant because they missed the 2nd period.
stlouisblues,lxo7lz6,2024-11-17 18:36:47,At this point give me Schuenman above Suter in the lineup. I'd rather go with 5 D than play Suter.
stlouisblues,lxnqaeb,2024-11-17 16:57:54,Can we pretty please with strawberry shortcake on top have another vintage Schenn performance today? Could we though???
stlouisblues,lxnt1ns,2024-11-17 17:13:07,RIP Demitra
stlouisblues,lxnteeh,2024-11-17 17:15:08,Sure seems like Perunovich isbwith Faulk. The official lineup was wrong.
stlouisblues,lxnuajz,2024-11-17 17:20:05,Does jakey roll his jersey sleeves lol
stlouisblues,lxnv4ff,2024-11-17 17:24:39,I hate that they have the same cheer as us
stlouisblues,lxnv894,2024-11-17 17:25:14,Texier stick looks sexier today so far
stlouisblues,lxnvgne,2024-11-17 17:26:33,And suddenly everyone is sloppy with the puck. Clean it back up boys.

stlouisblues,lxnybws,2024-11-17 17:42:46,Ugh. So close to getting out of the period
stlouisblues,lxnycp5,2024-11-17 17:42:54,That’s too easy
stlouisblues,lxnydxg,2024-11-17 17:43:05,Shitty calls always lead to a pp goal fuck off
stlouisblues,lxnyfpr,2024-11-17 17:43:22,Can’t leave a guy all alone in the blue paint 
stlouisblues,lxnygx6,2024-11-17 17:43:34,I'm sorry but that goal was mostly on Mathieu Joseph. He moves that puck up we have a possible breakaway and instead Sunny takes a (weak) penalty and we get scored on. Dang
stlouisblues,lxnyhf2,2024-11-17 17:43:39,Scotty P saved that it looked like
stlouisblues,lxo1vyx,2024-11-17 18:03:07,Instant disappointment
stlouisblues,lxo1yq4,2024-11-17 18:03:34,FUCK THESE 17 AND 18 SECOND IN GOALS MOTHERFUCKER
stlouisblues,lxo20dn,2024-11-17 18:03:50,Two really bad mishandles with the puck by Hofer so far. That one cost us.
stlouisblues,lxo28lk,2024-11-17 18:05:09,Note to home crew. Really long goal horn when we play Carolina next year.
stlouisblues,lxo2dtd,2024-11-17 18:05:59,Suter twice as calamitous on that one. Let's play him 40 minutes.
stlouisblues,lxo2erv,2024-11-17 18:06:08,Gotta see a response here or else this one is another one that's just gonna get away from us.
stlouisblues,lxo2gzh,2024-11-17 18:06:30,Wanted to pass that too much
stlouisblues,lxo3830,2024-11-17 18:10:54,We forgot how to pass again
stlouisblues,lxo3ie1,2024-11-17 18:12:34,3 on 1 and they don't even get a shot on goal out of it
stlouisblues,lxo43gg,2024-11-17 18:16:04,Hahahaha Rod's face
stlouisblues,lxo4529,2024-11-17 18:16:20,Would be nice to get one here
stlouisblues,lxo4t8g,2024-11-17 18:20:17,Didn't even try to shoot it
stlouisblues,lxo51kp,2024-11-17 18:21:37,Good pass by Saad. Suter was so surprised when it was right on his tape
stlouisblues,lxo55h8,2024-11-17 18:22:16,Liking what I’m seeing from Schueneman  kinda hope he stays with the club if he’s gunna play like that.
stlouisblues,lxo6vw2,2024-11-17 18:32:28,It kills me when we do nothing with those big passes
stlouisblues,lxo7yzi,2024-11-17 18:38:52,Did Walker change directions there? Looked like a clean outlet and suddenly it's an icing
stlouisblues,lxo8o6j,2024-11-17 18:42:55,Let’s find some puck possession in the 3rd…giving Canes too much time in their O-zone
stlouisblues,lxoba5q,2024-11-17 18:58:13,Time for a Violent Femmes period... third verse same as the first.
stlouisblues,lxod9k8,2024-11-17 19:09:41,Less than ideal
stlouisblues,lxof2yl,2024-11-17 19:20:03,Damn parayko made martinook pay for his own turnover
stlouisblues,lxog2jl,2024-11-17 19:25:37,If we come out of this timeout with a checking line I swear to Christmas...
stlouisblues,lxogq56,2024-11-17 19:29:13,Icing??? It went right through the Canes Dman.
stlouisblues,lxlwyq4,2024-11-17 11:05:01,Thoughts on the rumors about Binnington might ask for a trade? I think it's just for clicks.
stlouisblues,lxohu4m,2024-11-17 19:35:41,I was busy making dinner for the kiddos. What'd I miss? lol
stlouisblues,lxo6wme,2024-11-17 18:32:36,Suter out here barely trying now. WTF???

stlouisblues,lxn59u8,2024-11-17 15:04:58,Only one change to the skater lineup and I'm pretty confident everyone will be able to guess it right away. The goalie should be Hofer but apparently nobody thought to ask Bannister. Such pros. # PROJECTED LINEUP**Forward**Jake Neighbours - Pavel Buchnevich - Jordan Kyrou  Dylan Holloway - Brayden Schenn - Brandon Saad  Alexey Toropchenko - Radek Faksa - Nathan Walker  Alexandre Texier - Oskar Sundqvist - Mathieu Joseph**Defense**Ryan Suter - Colton Parayko  Corey Schueneman - Justin Faulk  Scott Perunovich - Matthew Kessel**Goalie**Joel Hofer / Jordan Binnington
stlouisblues,lxnqr2l,2024-11-17 17:00:25,LGB!!! Show them how back we are
stlouisblues,lxnu4tb,2024-11-17 17:19:13,LFGGGG BLUES
stlouisblues,lxnuht1,2024-11-17 17:21:11,What is this blues team? Looks like schenn kyrou and texier are all stars today for 5 minutes
stlouisblues,lxnuzf3,2024-11-17 17:23:53,Bad pass Buchy
stlouisblues,lxnv4cn,2024-11-17 17:24:38,Buch I cri everytime
stlouisblues,lxnv5wx,2024-11-17 17:24:53,Did rod the bod make the canes stay on the bikes too late after their game yesterday?
stlouisblues,lxnwbot,2024-11-17 17:31:20,That’s 2 times someone has bit it over there in the ice. Someone needs to look at that patch
stlouisblues,lxny77u,2024-11-17 17:42:01,Alright big shorty time
stlouisblues,lxny98c,2024-11-17 17:42:20,Well fuck
stlouisblues,lxny9oh,2024-11-17 17:42:25,I must say that WTF line really gives team fits.
stlouisblues,lxnyel7,2024-11-17 17:43:11,Stay out of the box please!
stlouisblues,lxnynd0,2024-11-17 17:44:35,So that happened at the beginning of the year against hofer. You never see it against binner. Is that hofers bad to not poke that? I posted that last time it happened and that was an identical play. Seems to me the defender takes the slot and the backdoor if it’s that low of a pass has toBe the goalie
stlouisblues,lxnz343,2024-11-17 17:47:06,Sad blue note noises....
stlouisblues,lxo1tlh,2024-11-17 18:02:45,Ouch
stlouisblues,lxo1xk4,2024-11-17 18:03:23,another turnover in our own zone and poor rebound management. ugh.
stlouisblues,lxo1yaq,2024-11-17 18:03:30,That’s a tough one there
stlouisblues,lxo205n,2024-11-17 18:03:48,Feels like a long second period
stlouisblues,lxo2ful,2024-11-17 18:06:19,Standing around puck watching that's what happens.
stlouisblues,lxo3avh,2024-11-17 18:11:22,We haven’t had any kind of the offensive pressure we had yesterday.
stlouisblues,lxo3bi7,2024-11-17 18:11:28,This team is determined to give me a heart attack tonight with these turnovers.
stlouisblues,lxo3jyk,2024-11-17 18:12:50,Just can’t turn pucks over at the blue line like that
stlouisblues,lxo3zda,2024-11-17 18:15:23,Yay smol PP time!
stlouisblues,lxo47r2,2024-11-17 18:16:47,Give us that throbbing PP.
stlouisblues,lxo699p,2024-11-17 18:28:42,Fuck
stlouisblues,lxo6zde,2024-11-17 18:33:03,I …sad.
stlouisblues,lxocfen,2024-11-17 19:04:50,Stop playing on your heels and let’s generate some offense!!!
stlouisblues,lxod3as,2024-11-17 19:08:41,Looks like we’re going to get the kill the clock and go home type of period
stlouisblues,lxodf0t,2024-11-17 19:10:31,Hockey used to be fun
stlouisblues,lxodnsl,2024-11-17 19:11:58, NOW THIS IS BLUES HOCKEY
stlouisblues,lxodu7d,2024-11-17 19:12:59,Skate that puck out…something BLUES don’t do a lot of lately
stlouisblues,lxoe3uj,2024-11-17 19:14:33,Good block Walker to help end the PK
stlouisblues,lxof3xd,2024-11-17 19:20:12,Fuckin hell Buch!
stlouisblues,lxogbna,2024-11-17 19:27:00,Hey who are they passing the puck to? [evergreen]
stlouisblues,lxmyfvd,2024-11-17 14:27:45,Fanduel today?
stlouisblues,lxo68ny,2024-11-17 18:28:36,Suter is deeply involved in every single goal against at this point. When was the last one he wasn't involved in?
stlouisblues,lxnzh7w,2024-11-17 17:49:20,How were they saying blues out shit canes 4-0 when the score is 1-1.  Just catching the game late.
stlouisblues,lxpjwxq,2024-11-17 23:39:43,The post-game letting everyone off the hook while blaming the goalies. 
stlouisblues,lxnypac,2024-11-17 17:44:54,Can we get rid of Jamie Rivers already?  It's like sitting in church listening to this guy.
stlouisblues,lxo5poi,2024-11-17 18:25:32,Holy homer Rivers. Suter needs a fucking chair out there half the time.
stlouisblues,lxnxj92,2024-11-17 17:38:11,And yet a ton of people still rip on him all the time.  It's really awful the way some people treat him.
stlouisblues,lxnwpuf,2024-11-17 17:33:31,And there's still yahoos on FB screaming to get rid of him. It's insane.
stlouisblues,lxnyz2o,2024-11-17 17:46:27,You don't get rid of guys that can skate like that.  I've bee saying to anyone who will listen the past two years when everyone was on that kid's ass.
stlouisblues,lxo79rg,2024-11-17 18:34:47,That tends to happen when a player is not in their natural position.. he’s trying to hard to think and be a center when he’s a wing player
stlouisblues,lxo77v0,2024-11-17 18:34:28,Teasing isn’t nice
stlouisblues,lxo8pb5,2024-11-17 18:43:07,"""A lot of great opportunities there!"""
stlouisblues,lxnwo8a,2024-11-17 17:33:16,He's a breakout machine.
stlouisblues,lxo4f2y,2024-11-17 18:17:58,Honestly it kinda looked like he lost an edge more than anything lol either way I’ll take jt
stlouisblues,lxo01jp,2024-11-17 17:52:32,Yeah right this moment I was imagining what it would be like to have Thomas' 20 minutes and Broberg's 20+ minutes back in with the effort and focus we've seen from the rest of the team the last few games. It makes me feel... reckless.
stlouisblues,lxo5fhv,2024-11-17 18:23:54,![gif](giphy|AaQYP9zh24UFi)
stlouisblues,lxmbixp,2024-11-17 12:25:28,It's a Sunday. Football fans have been drinking since 6am. I think you're good lol
stlouisblues,lxn8lrd,2024-11-17 15:22:59,Hofer in net that game too 
stlouisblues,lxoh1fp,2024-11-17 19:31:01,Judging by his playing career hockey IQ was never his forté.
stlouisblues,lxnwqpd,2024-11-17 17:33:39,An impostor is wearing his sweater! No really the guy has made big improvements so happy to see
stlouisblues,lxoiem0,2024-11-17 19:39:01,That’s what I miss most about Panger even in ugly losses the broadcast was never boring. He’d either shit on the team and say harsh truths or tell funny stories about the past etc..
stlouisblues,lxohxz9,2024-11-17 19:36:19,Yeah I like rivers but Panger would have been more attached to reality there.
stlouisblues,lxq9skj,2024-11-18 03:46:19,Rivers stopped being honest about this team since he got the job.
stlouisblues,lxnucvw,2024-11-17 17:20:25,I'll be cool if he just sets people up like that all night
stlouisblues,lxnuc0n,2024-11-17 17:20:18,SHOW YOURSELVES
stlouisblues,lxnubwm,2024-11-17 17:20:17,I am erect
stlouisblues,lxnulln,2024-11-17 17:21:45,I love how when Kyrou makes one bad play SELL HIM FOR NOTHING HES TERRIBLE. But they just ignore him being the point leader of this team and consistently showing up while playing better defensively crickets.
stlouisblues,lxnunrh,2024-11-17 17:22:05,I am a kyrou consistency hater and it looks like he found his game. I will be pissed if they put Thomas on his line
stlouisblues,lxo3t6j,2024-11-17 18:14:23,It’s about all they can do to get it out of the zone lol
stlouisblues,lxo474x,2024-11-17 18:16:41,At this point why not? He hasn’t been flashy or anything but you can’t deny he’s working hard and making good plays.
stlouisblues,lxo4gba,2024-11-17 18:18:10,We’re about to find out
stlouisblues,lxo6mvd,2024-11-17 18:30:57,Not to mention the puck was right next to our players. Idk how in the world it wasn’t atleast cleared.
stlouisblues,lxofxrc,2024-11-17 19:24:54,Getting the Canes right where he wants 'em! Or something
stlouisblues,lxogufj,2024-11-17 19:29:53,Where's the dip shit from earlier who was giving you shit about criticizing bannister?
stlouisblues,lxnxoxn,2024-11-17 17:39:05,That was an offensive turnover nothing to do with his defensive obviously still a selke candidate
stlouisblues,lxo4bah,2024-11-17 18:17:21,He's just a really big city SC fan
stlouisblues,lxo61ex,2024-11-17 18:27:26,Heh I'd go with voluntarily crap instead of bad. They did everything except remember the point of PP is to score in that net thingy.
stlouisblues,lxoe5ei,2024-11-17 19:14:48,It’s mini mite hockey!
stlouisblues,lxoids0,2024-11-17 19:38:52,Entire performance aside you *could* say they are tired it’s their third game in four days and fourth in six
stlouisblues,lxoh6jj,2024-11-17 19:31:50,Nah Bannister should make the call.  Don't want our goal differential to ever dream of being positive.
stlouisblues,lxo8ju7,2024-11-17 18:42:14,I don’t think Bannister is that kind of coach unfortunately.
stlouisblues,lxmhn8r,2024-11-17 12:59:20,Parayko I'm not worried about. It;s the other one that scares me.
stlouisblues,lxmj821,2024-11-17 13:07:58,He took a big open ice hit and hasn't played since that game.
stlouisblues,lxma61q,2024-11-17 12:17:57,I remember the radio crew saying he is injuried but luckily the injury is upper body (he was out a long time and slipped down in the draft due to a lower body injury)
stlouisblues,lxmc2u2,2024-11-17 12:28:34,He's week to week last update I saw after taking a hit I'm glad it's not his knee again but he's missing a ton of development time and that's really concerning
stlouisblues,lxnsdce,2024-11-17 17:09:23,We've actually won three of the last four in Carolina. And last year it was a tight 2-1 loss. We usually show up here.
stlouisblues,lxnw3yr,2024-11-17 17:30:09,& on 50% of those bad passes he should’ve just shot it.
stlouisblues,lxnygrd,2024-11-17 17:43:32,Suter out to lunch. Inexplicably.
stlouisblues,lxo4sgx,2024-11-17 18:20:09,Can't miss if you don't try
stlouisblues,lxoav55,2024-11-17 18:55:46,Agree…very predictable and they don’t zip around to confuse the other teams which allows the other teams’ D to cover the slots effectively
stlouisblues,lxodiax,2024-11-17 19:11:03,Welcome to another mediocre year where we barely miss the playoffs and get the 14th overall draft pick.
stlouisblues,lxofrpp,2024-11-17 19:23:58,They're missing high danger shots. That's what counts. 
stlouisblues,lxohojt,2024-11-17 19:34:46,Personally if we want a top 5 pick. Keep bannister lol. 
stlouisblues,lxo7uku,2024-11-17 18:38:11,Right?? He’s been a small bright spot tonight.
stlouisblues,lxnzbcl,2024-11-17 17:48:25,And the same power play song.  That's hockey in the south though.  Nothing original.
stlouisblues,lxnynlf,2024-11-17 17:44:38,Suter man. Completely out of position.
stlouisblues,lxo33py,2024-11-17 18:10:12,Hmm. That one's totally on slo mo Suter for my money.
stlouisblues,lxo5p2v,2024-11-17 18:25:26,I wish. We always seem to be in a hurry to play the after goal music.
stlouisblues,lxlz2dr,2024-11-17 11:16:41,Remember all those articles the past couple years about Parayko for sure being traded to every team in the league? I wouldn’t believe it unless the team or him come out with something. But also I wouldn’t blame him. The Blues defense sure are fucking up his numbers.
stlouisblues,lxmgu1y,2024-11-17 12:54:54,"Where did it start? That's always the first question to ask. Find who started the ""story"" and you'll pretty much have your answer. From what I can tell it started here: [https://rg.org/news/hockey/nhl-execs-weigh-in-on-trade-buzz-surrounding-blues-goalie-jordan-binnington](https://rg.org/news/hockey/nhl-execs-weigh-in-on-trade-buzz-surrounding-blues-goalie-jordan-binnington)Which means it's total clickbait bullshit based on one guy's opinion and the opinion wasn;t even a strong one. It was like ""gosh maybe he asks out"". This is the state of hockey media now. A bunch of clowns running around making up bullshit and then everyone else repeats the bullshit opinion as fact.Long story short I would not give this any serious attention."
stlouisblues,lxmq0rh,2024-11-17 13:43:42,Pretty doubtful for 2 things. He’s the leader on this team and that would go away elsewhere. And the blues would have to be able to actually get something which goalies have low trade value these days unless theirs are hurt and it’s the last piece. I could see it in a couple years at the end of binners contract if we still suck because they feel bad. But if you trade binner today it’s like the cp55 talks last couple years. You are now looking for that guy. It’s not helpful unless you are delusional and purposely losing.
stlouisblues,lxn5mkd,2024-11-17 15:06:53,I saw that same article and it was just reckless bullshit. Literally just one guy saying I wonder if he'll ask for a trade? Not even a guy saying he heard anything credible. Just one dude wondering out loud. It's a pure fabrication.
stlouisblues,lxlxvam,2024-11-17 11:10:02,I saw the same thing this morning and hope it's just clicks
stlouisblues,lxmzzwx,2024-11-17 14:36:05,I mean if he leaves he leaves. We should be able to get something for him sell high. 
stlouisblues,lxnm5ap,2024-11-17 16:35:16,I think Doug would have to pry loose some serious talent from Carolina to pull off that deal with the fan base.
stlouisblues,lxnsj2t,2024-11-17 17:10:16,He’s about to become the all time wins leader he doesn’t want to leave and we’re not going to trade him. The same rumors have been circulating about trading Binner for at least two seasons.
stlouisblues,lxoi7nn,2024-11-17 19:37:53,Imagine you were making dinner for the kiddos and the blues weren’t playing today. Pretty much the same as that.
stlouisblues,lxohy3a,2024-11-17 19:36:20,A good first period and then a whole lot of turnovers and poor line decisions
stlouisblues,lxohwc6,2024-11-17 19:36:03,Literally nothing.
stlouisblues,lxo71j4,2024-11-17 18:33:25,He just glides everywhere he goes. No effort. He looks like he wants to take a nap
stlouisblues,lxo8u3z,2024-11-17 18:43:53,We are playing a 39 year old 25 year-old-minutes.
stlouisblues,lxn5vu3,2024-11-17 15:08:17,Btw Bolduc yesterday: 10 minutes and change three shot attempts 1 SOG 2 hits 1 takeaways 61% on ice xG share. We were down in their zone for most of his minutes as usual. He needs to play our 1st round A prospects FFS. And keeping Perunovich as 3LD is just overt incompetence. I'm so sick of Bannister's bullshit.
stlouisblues,lxnyxbr,2024-11-17 17:46:10,He never should have been there alone. Weak side D responsibility. Suter off wandering around somewhere.
stlouisblues,lxn547u,2024-11-17 15:04:10,Yep!
stlouisblues,lxo6h1s,2024-11-17 18:29:59,Kyrou and Suter are to blame for that hands down. Idec who else was on the line those two stood out like sore thumbs
stlouisblues,lxo2ca8,2024-11-17 18:05:45,u/Infamous-Safety4632 ok nooooow they've out shit the Canes.
stlouisblues,lxnzjcq,2024-11-17 17:49:38,Sorry shot
stlouisblues,lxo06bw,2024-11-17 17:53:18,Yeah I'm not a fan. He's so homer-y but only for our worst players.
stlouisblues,lxny4zj,2024-11-17 17:41:40,I just skip the fb posts now if we lose. Itll always be Kyrou’s fault even if he had 3 points that game
stlouisblues,lxnz30b,2024-11-17 17:47:05,The way he responded to the booing last year sold me on him 1000%
stlouisblues,lxnwxya,2024-11-17 17:34:47,Just like there are yahoo's saying fire Bannister every time something goes wrong. 
stlouisblues,lxohaao,2024-11-17 19:32:27,Lately I have no choice but to agree with you regarding bannister. Because before he was actually doing some decent shit with the team lol. But now no way in hell can I sit here and defend him. 
stlouisblues,lxo4i55,2024-11-17 18:18:28,I think with out Powerplay we can’t really get any worse. We’re near the bottom of the league on conversions and why not let you new guy try out his stick? He made a great pass to Holloway in the slot last game and the goalie had to make a pretty good save to stop it. Let Schueneman cook!
stlouisblues,lxohh7o,2024-11-17 19:33:34,I can confidently say that I was a bannister defender till about 3 weeks ago lol. 
stlouisblues,lxohdp0,2024-11-17 19:33:00,I'd love to praise Bannister. It's not my fault he's a tire fire. 
stlouisblues,lxo7i1e,2024-11-17 18:36:09,They never had looks at the net though. All that possession is fine but if you never manage to get the puck off the wall and into a dangerous area wtf are you even doing?
stlouisblues,lxo8wjp,2024-11-17 18:44:17,No he’ll quietly explain that they need to be better and then they will all talk about their feelings.
stlouisblues,lxob6p8,2024-11-17 18:57:40,Nah he's the type who institutes something stupid that backfires and then pretends the team did it on their own at the presser.
stlouisblues,lxmjdyp,2024-11-17 13:08:52,Yeah really concerning to miss a season and a half of prime development time. Hopefully once he gets healthy he can stay healthy
stlouisblues,lxohfla,2024-11-17 19:33:19,Exactly this. Retooling is less fun than a full rebuild bc there’s not the same light at the end of the tunnel.
stlouisblues,lxo83dd,2024-11-17 18:39:35,Agreed.
stlouisblues,lxnyr6t,2024-11-17 17:45:12,True. Also Parayko for not clearing it and giving it back to the Canes
stlouisblues,lxo3usr,2024-11-17 18:14:39,The entire play broke down because of the mishandle by Hofer on the boards.
stlouisblues,lxmme9n,2024-11-17 13:24:55,Most of those start with Pagnotta who simply will not let this lie go. Dude has been running it for years now. He drags its fetid carcass out every 4-5 months and then everyone in the hockey bubble repeats it uncritically. It's pathetic.
stlouisblues,lxmav42,2024-11-17 12:21:50,It 99% is for clicks but there's always a chance that Binny may want a more competitive team. That said I'm sure he knows this is temp until our prospects are up to snuff and start lighting up the lamps
stlouisblues,lxoiecs,2024-11-17 19:38:58,Hell yeah dude thanks for the run down! lol
stlouisblues,lxo7c0p,2024-11-17 18:35:10,Exactly. Not moving his feet meekly waving his stick around don't even ask him to take the man right in front of him. This is fucking insane.
stlouisblues,lxoaw5m,2024-11-17 18:55:56,It's surreal.
stlouisblues,lxnli0g,2024-11-17 16:31:41,Schueneman on second pair over Perunovich is wild
stlouisblues,lxnj4kf,2024-11-17 16:18:42,This stuff used to make me mad but now I am just resigned. Perunovich is 100% going to get top pair minutes for another org someday.
stlouisblues,lxn9pkb,2024-11-17 15:28:51,I agree about Bolduc. He hasn’t done anything on the scoresheet but he does seem to be playing well. I would get taking him out of the lineup if that wasn’t the case. As for perunovich and Kessel I think they’ve played decently together over the past couple of games. They were on the ice yesterday for a goal but it was like 75% Holloway getting lost and not covering his man in the zone leaving Scott to cover two guys. Hell when they were shelled 8-1 they were both +1. I think Faulk and Perunovich looked good as well last game but I would imagine the thinking is that Faulk will help cover Schueneman more than Kessel would and they need to roll all 3 pairs as it’s the second game in a back to back. As long as they don’t just sit the 3rd pair and only play for 10 minutes I don’t hate it.
stlouisblues,lxnzhwx,2024-11-17 17:49:25,Super had to worry about guy in slot. That's why it's a power play they have 1 more guy.
stlouisblues,lxnz85b,2024-11-17 17:47:54,He was on the center ice guy. I’m not disagreeing with you. It looks bad. Was just a genuine question
stlouisblues,lxo6mbi,2024-11-17 18:30:52,Buchy made the turnover but this time it's the forward who actually attempted a back check?
stlouisblues,lxo0g3k,2024-11-17 17:54:52,Depends on how much Carolina BBQ they've had.  Very possible they did out shit the Canes.
stlouisblues,lxo26yp,2024-11-17 18:04:54,And just no passion.  Been watching the other team's broadcast on ESPN+
stlouisblues,lxnx3m5,2024-11-17 17:35:40,Bannister is in over his head
stlouisblues,lxnxnxc,2024-11-17 17:38:55,Bannister isn't an NHL coach.  I fully expect him to be let go once his two year deal ends.
stlouisblues,lxnxec0,2024-11-17 17:37:24,That would be a fantastic point if that was actually what we were saying. Alas...
stlouisblues,lxo4u5p,2024-11-17 18:20:26,With the way this power play is looking fuck it let him on the first power play. That was abysmal.
stlouisblues,lxohr8s,2024-11-17 19:35:12,I wasn't talking about you at all haha there was someone in this thread specifically that gave Bambino some shit about bannister posting and they were just wrong
stlouisblues,lxo8cqa,2024-11-17 18:41:06,Yeah but not every PP shot needs to be an obvious open shot. They weren't looking to set up fornshots anyway.
stlouisblues,lxo90k6,2024-11-17 18:44:55,Almost makes me wish we had a torts in the room. Could you imagine the chaos?
stlouisblues,lxo0irp,2024-11-17 17:55:18,Was it Colt on that one? I know he gave one away but I thought that was on an earlier shift. I'd have to rewind and check it again. Maybe it was him.Edit: Are you talking about the bouncing puck he could not settle behind the net? Mmm I dunno man. I certainly would not consider that a giveaway if only because he never actually had it. I'd have a hard time faulting him much for that.
stlouisblues,lxo47ly,2024-11-17 18:16:45,I suppose well agree to disagree. His pass was right there and easy to handle and Suter could barely be bothered.
stlouisblues,lxmbdkd,2024-11-17 12:24:39,At the minimum he's got the all time wins record keeping him here for the short term and then he can try to focus on getting the Olympic nod. Doesn't have to be Blues success as long as he's succeeding it should scratch his competitive itch (I hope)
stlouisblues,lxnlnw1,2024-11-17 16:32:35,Yeah it's cartoonish at this point. Can't think of a single bad reason to do that let alone a good one.
stlouisblues,lxnanrq,2024-11-17 15:34:04,Perunovich should be with the tougher matchups. That's abundantly clear. And he's still got ceiling to reach while Schuenman is a 29 yo career AHLer. I just don;t see how this guy is following the kids plan. That may be the worst thing of all.
stlouisblues,lxnznxp,2024-11-17 17:50:21,Yeah I understood the question. Hofer should not have to worry about guys standing at his back post waiting for a pass. It was Suter's area/man to patrol. He tends to wander off sometimes for some reason. We really need Brobs back.
stlouisblues,lxo6ptx,2024-11-17 18:31:27,Kyrou made the turnover. He tried to get fancy in the corner and got pinned by Orlov. Then the puck went the other way.
stlouisblues,lxohvws,2024-11-17 19:35:59,I know that I responded strictly because I was giving bambino shit a couple weeks ago regarding bannister. 
stlouisblues,lxoao8h,2024-11-17 18:54:38,Yea could definitely just look for a random point shot when you're not finding anything else.
stlouisblues,lxoaroc,2024-11-17 18:55:12,And the press conferences would be must see tv.
stlouisblues,lxo2hkc,2024-11-17 18:06:35,Eh you're right it's a little severe. That said I think he could've made a better play tho yeah that puck was bouncing. In Suters position he expects Parayko to play that properly and is out of position mostly due to that imo. Which is why I blamed Joseph in the first place lol
stlouisblues,lxnbmby,2024-11-17 15:39:19,Well that’s kinda what I mean with as long as the 3rd pair gets good minutes. Honestly both he and kessel to grow need those minutes. Having Suter eat up 25 minutes a night is kinda crazy.
stlouisblues,lxo6tcy,2024-11-17 18:32:03,Buch made the shitty pass????
stlouisblues,lxob1gw,2024-11-17 18:56:48,I’d pay good money to see some behind the door intermissions if we had him. I swear this team would probably drive him to have a stroke.
stlouisblues,lxndaex,2024-11-17 15:48:02,But the 3rd pairing doesn't get good minutes. And every time Suter plays 25 it comes out of the young guys' time. Kessel could use some growth to be sure but he has not earned playing up the lineup. Perunovich definitely has. Bannister is far more concerned with his job status than with actually doing the job. And frankly he's not good at what he imagines is a self preservation act either.
stlouisblues,lxo6w4c,2024-11-17 18:32:30,The shitty pass to Kyrou in the corner? That’s literally where the puck got turned over.
stlouisblues,lxnh3me,2024-11-17 16:07:42,Idk Kessel has played decent enough. He had a rougher start but the past week or so he’s been decent. I’d say he’s played better than Joseph overalll. Perunovich also had a rougher start preseason included but he’s started to heat up. The problem is Suter just eating minutes when he also been a liability. Perunovich will never be a Makar or a Hughes. Both time and injuries just aren’t on his side. He could become a good second pair pp quarterback offensive dman. Kessel has a bit more time but I think his peak is maybe the 4th dman realistically 5th defenseman with PK time.
stlouisblues,lxnly1g,2024-11-17 16:34:09,The irrational Perunovich haters have entered the chat to downvote both of us. Cute stuff. :D
stlouisblues,lxnj5ut,2024-11-17 16:18:55,Heh. Yeah... the past week with Perunovich who apparently makes everyone he pairs with better. Kessel still leads the league in giveaways per 60 and D zone giveaways per 60. He still hits less than Perunovich per 60 which is wild. He has been absolutely brutal this season until being put with Perunovich and since then he's been solid. If he is ever our 2nd pairing RD we are in a world of trouble. That said yes Kessel also needs to play to learn. Just keep him sheltered on the 3rd pairing or even better send him down to play top pairing minutes in Springfield. I'm not a fan of him on PK but also understand he is needed there at the moment. Honestly I think he will get much less leash once Bannister is jettisoned. The guy was never a prime prospect and he has done nothing to change that so far. The main thing going for him is Bannister obviously loves him.Joseph has been excellent positionally skating strong playing hard... it's just those damn turnovers again.
stlouisblues,lxnn1je,2024-11-17 16:40:09,I had this thing wrote up about xGF/xGA and Corsi/fr wick but then my app crashed. Basically what it was was Kessel had a really bad start. Tons of turnovers like 16 through like 5 games. He’s had like 6 or 7 through the past 10. His expected +/- (xGF - xGA) has risen from like a -3 or 4 to a -1.2. He’s gotten a lot better. Joseph prior to his injury has had the opposite phenomenon. Started well but just increased his turnovers his expected +/- fell from positive to -2.2 etc.
stlouisblues,lxnq4fm,2024-11-17 16:56:59,Oh Kessel has definitely picked it up a bit over the last couple weeks no doubt. But there was nowhere to go but up he had over 10 giveaways per 60 for a while. And then you add in the ghastly pinch percentage and hospital passes that aren't technically giveaways but realistically are. Plus very hot and cold defending. He's been better recently looks more comfortable.Here's his game log with giveaways (like half or so of his tend to be D zone). It's much better the last five games. The improvement has been very recent much of it tied to having Perunovich around to handle the puck.[https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/matt-kessel-player-game-log?season=2024&seasonType=reg](https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/matt-kessel-player-game-log?season=2024&seasonType=reg)
stlouisblues,lxl0vjz,2024-11-17 07:26:57,I dunno how to even guess.     The number of times the Blues have been without 3 lhd at the same time is too high.      Technically rn we’re down 5 with leddy Broberg po krug and tucker.   It’s insane.   That’s an entire nhl teams worth of lhd.In the recent past the seasons Perunovich missed the giant chunk scandella missed and krug missing a good 25 games like clockwork has been the single largest contributor to our struggles imo. The dudes on the right side can’t possibly get into a rhythm when you’re dipping 6 guys down the depth chart for their partner. They always seemed to result in chunks where 3 were out simultaneously.  I just can’t imagine what happens if this weird positional curse is somehow removed and we have all healthy dudes.
stlouisblues,lxiyjqx,2024-11-16 20:33:35,Suter-ParaykoBroberg-Faulk Leddy-Perunovich/Joseph Wouldn’t be surprised if we try to move Leddy or Suter at the deadline and move Broberg up to play with Parayko. Also can’t see Suter continuing to play top pair minutes every night.Post deadline I would assume Broberg-Parayko Perunovich-FaulkPOJ-Kessel
stlouisblues,lxk308z,2024-11-17 01:28:36,What they will be who knows with Bannister. Here's what they should be:Brobs - Colt  Perunovich - Pornstache  POJ - KesselLeddy at the ready. Suter shot from a cannon.
stlouisblues,lxj4ec2,2024-11-16 21:11:00,Leddy has a NTC so I doubt we could move him.
stlouisblues,lxj7fss,2024-11-16 21:31:06,Could ya see them moving Perunovich instead of Leddy?
stlouisblues,lxj8uxc,2024-11-16 21:40:31,Is it a full NTC? I could also see him waiving to go to a contender
stlouisblues,lxjkb0u,2024-11-16 22:57:47,I mean Perunovich would get a better return but I can’t see them moving him.
stlouisblues,lxjeqin,2024-11-16 22:19:42,Yeah. We need a capped-out contender to have injuries so we can rent our cap space this year get him off the books next year and bring back a pick for our troubles.Other thing that is relevant is that his NTC becomes partial after this year so he does have an incentive to steer things to a particular team now if he can because he loses control soon.
stlouisblues,lxk2tne,2024-11-17 01:26:59,IIRC it drops down to a 15 team NTC this summer.
stlouisblues,lxk2scj,2024-11-17 01:26:40,It's bizarre that anyone would downvote you for this. Perunovich haters are so irrational.
stlouisblues,lxi9opx,2024-11-16 17:58:51,Perunovich has a pretty high ceiling if he would just start playing like it.  He's looked like a totally different player over the past few weeks and he'll never get a better chance than right now to show what he's got.
stlouisblues,lxi9tne,2024-11-16 17:59:42,Definitely. He's finally starting to come into his own and should be rewarded for his good play
stlouisblues,lxiay42,2024-11-16 18:06:44,I'll be honest I thought his time here was over when Bannister was gonna put Broberg on the pp.
stlouisblues,lxifxyb,2024-11-16 18:38:06,I’ve wanted Scotty to play with Faulk for like 3 years! Their games just make sense together.
stlouisblues,lxii6t1,2024-11-16 18:52:00,Perunovich needs to have confidence in his shot which looks like is improving.  His skating and passing are there.  He isn’t there for his D for sure but that’s not his game.  I’ve been high on him for awhile but that has been wearing thin so I’m happy with what he has been doing
stlouisblues,lxiukyy,2024-11-16 20:08:33,Agreed they look good together. Perun in general looks good when he gets more playing time I gotta imagine it’s hard to keep the legs warm when your playing 30 second shifts every 5 min
stlouisblues,lxjiscp,2024-11-16 22:47:14,It's honestly a no-brainer. Brobs with Colt then Perunovich-Faulk.
stlouisblues,lxio3ge,2024-11-16 19:28:18,Scottie rocks
stlouisblues,lxjp6s8,2024-11-16 23:34:16,Perunovich just needs to trust in his abilities. He’s mostly been playing like he thinks he’s one mistake away from being sent to the AHL so he passes up a lot of great opportunities that confident Dmen with less skill won’t pass up. Hopefully with all the injuries to our defense he knows he has some leash to prove what he can do.
stlouisblues,lxncyrz,2024-11-17 15:46:23,No it should be a puck-moving defenseman and a stay-at-home defenseman in each pairing
stlouisblues,lxlix25,2024-11-17 09:41:36,I'd agree. What I'd really like to see though is Broberg and Leddy back on the ice and Faulk and Perunovich as one of the strongest 3RD pairings in the league!
stlouisblues,lxnzujf,2024-11-17 17:51:25,Just don't break up Parayko and Suter.  Leddy can play on the 3rd pairing with Kessel
stlouisblues,lxirkm8,2024-11-16 19:49:42,First time I saw him was against Colorado in the playoffs. He was way better in those games than I've ever seen him lately.You can tell he has potential.  Someone needs to fire his ass up somehow
stlouisblues,lxlqug6,2024-11-17 10:29:54,I’m yet to be a fan of his 5-on-5 play but if he is in the lineup because of injuries I would really like to see him used on the number 1 PP UNIT.  That is where he would be most useful.  I rate him a little better than Faulk with the man advantage and you give Faulk just a bit of rest as he is obviously so much stronger in the 5-on-5 and short-handed situations.
stlouisblues,lxm0zgz,2024-11-17 11:27:15,I would rather see a 6-man defensive unit that doesn't have to rely on Scott Perunovich. Unfortunately that's not in the cards right now. He's better than anything we have in Springfield right now.At the end of the day Perunovich is likely to be a sheltered offensive D specialist on a basement team. Given our injuries that's the type of unit the Blues are deploying right now. That said Perunovich and Faulk together have looked passable so I hope there's something there.I'm looking forward to the day we can add a legit top-4 D-man from outside of the organization and we get a chance to see what Lindstein and Jiricek can do.
stlouisblues,lxsu3x0,2024-11-18 14:06:15,It's purely anecdotal but I think him finally getting his first goal lifted a huge weight off his back. If he can stay healthy I don't see why he can't be a good 2nd pairing offensive d man.
stlouisblues,lxifsdy,2024-11-16 18:37:07,There must be vomit on his sweater already. Mom's spaghetti. Because this opportunity comes once in a lifetime.
stlouisblues,lxj5144,2024-11-16 21:15:11,If all these injuries result in Perunovich finally reaching his potential it was worth it.
stlouisblues,lxjp3mf,2024-11-16 23:33:35,Had Krug in the way.
stlouisblues,lxkc3w1,2024-11-17 03:00:01,Yeah but Scottie doesn’t know
stlouisblues,lxmonji,2024-11-17 13:36:43,You're not a fan of the Blues far and away active team leader in 5v5 xG share? I'm baffled.    Btw...  Faulk's goal share with Perunovich the last two seasons: 67%  Faulk's goal share w/o Perunovich the last two seasons: 33%
stlouisblues,lxla7pj,2024-11-17 08:41:31,You mean staff finally giving him a useful deployment so we can see his potential.
stlouisblues,lxlncnd,2024-11-17 10:09:07,That was my assessment of Perunovich in general. He's got Krug's skillset and deficiencies but we already had Krug and you don't bench a vet like Krug outside of fringe circumstances. If this is the real Perunovich it's a coup. I remember looking at his advanced stats last year and he had some seriously favorables there even though I was unimpressed most of the times I saw him play. If he can keep this up Broberg Peru and D-first guy (which is exactly how Lindstein looks to pan out he's a lot like Brodin) is worlds better than we were at a few years ago with Mikkola Krug and Leddy
stlouisblues,lxley92,2024-11-17 09:15:09,To be fair he hadn’t done much to justify ice time previously. Being yanked back and forth and all the injuries obviously didn’t help but It’s a perfect combination of him finally feeling confident and coaches having no option but to keep him in there.

stlouisblues,lxigoxa,2024-11-16 18:42:44,FAKSA APPRECIATION ### First Period:- **Radek Faksa and Scott Perunovich**: Faksa scored the opening goal at 6:25 into the game redirecting Perunovich’s shot through traffic. This early goal set the tone for the Blues.### Third Period:- **Radek Faksa and Nathan Walker**: Walker tied the game 2-2 at 9:18 of the third period receiving a pass from Faksa behind the net and snapping it in from the high slot. This crucial play set up the Blues for the overtime win.

stlouisblues,lxhntii,2024-11-16 15:56:09,BOLDUC IN AND WE WIN?  Coincidence??
stlouisblues,lxi6rfn,2024-11-16 17:41:29,How did Perun look today? Did he finally get top 4 mins with Faulk?
stlouisblues,lxjywc9,2024-11-17 00:52:15,"Prospect roundup time:\- Prince Albert Raiders **Tomas Mrsic** was named #1 star for the second day in a row after his two goals (including the GWG) and two assists led the way in a 4-1 comeback win. He scored on his only two shots and was +3. On the Edmonton side **Adam Jecho** had 3 SOG.Highlights: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2\_VdcMu45FY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_VdcMu45FY)\- **Jakub Stancl** has a monster game as Kelowna rallied super late for a 5-4 victory. Stancl had a goal (he now has four during a three-game goal streak) helped set up the last minute winner had 5 SOG and won 13 of 18 draws.The goal: [https://youtu.be/dtI5Xd3V9Mk?si=B5ZjK0N4r7uRAO16&t=331](https://youtu.be/dtI5Xd3V9Mk?si=B5ZjK0N4r7uRAO16&t=331) \- **Jimmy Snuggs** fired 10 SOG (he now leads the nation in this category) to no avail as #3 Minnesota fell 3-1 to end a nine-game win streak.\- **Otto Stenberg** worked 10:54 as Malmo won 4-3. He has 2 SOG and a hit. \- **Theo Lindstein** played a hair under 5 minutes in Brynas' 4-3 loss. \- **Arseni Koromyslov** played a valiant 20:12 the most on his team by nearly two minutes but Lada Togliatti fell 2-1 in a shootout. Despite the loss the point gained moved them into a playoff position. Koromyslov had two takeaways and a shot block. \- **Juraj Pekarcik** had 4 SOG as 1st place Moncton sailed to a 5-1 win.\- **Will McIsaac** and Spokane won 3-0. He was forced to miss the last 10 minutes or so after taking aroughing + 10 min. misconduct penalty.Finally Springfield won 4-2 with plenty of standouts.\- **Simon Robertsson**'s first AHL goal began the scoring. He was the game's 3rd star.\- **Marcus Sylvegard** scored his 6th goal (on 4 SOG) in 15 games and now has a four-game point streak. \- **""Alex"" Kaskimaki** ran his point streak to five games with a PP assist.\- **Dylan Peterson** had an ENG and an assist his first points in 7 games.\- **Vadim Zherenko** made 25 saves to snap a personal four-game losing streak.\- **Nikita Alexandrov** was a +2.\- **Leo Loof** was a +1 and should have been given an assist on the Robertsson goal.Full highlights: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxDt81ULO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxDt81ULO0)"
stlouisblues,lxhmpyr,2024-11-16 15:50:15,I love it when the St. Louis Blues win hockey games!
stlouisblues,lxhmxt8,2024-11-16 15:51:25,**WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK!!!**
stlouisblues,lxhsaos,2024-11-16 16:20:35,I really wish we had offense…
stlouisblues,lxj6fa9,2024-11-16 21:24:21,p.s.  FUCK BOSTON I HOPE THEY LOSE THE NEXT ONE TOO
stlouisblues,lxhq4w6,2024-11-16 16:08:44,Over this season and last Perunovich-Faulk as a pairing: 13-6 on ice goal share advantage (68.4%) and 57.8% xG share (!!!).Faulk's goal share during this span while playing with everyone else combined? 33%.
stlouisblues,lxhnl1o,2024-11-16 15:54:53,It felt like that losing streak was going to last forever it feels damn good to end it though. ***BLUES WIN!!!***
stlouisblues,lxho962,2024-11-16 15:58:30,THE TURNAROUND BEGINS NOW. RECKLESS
stlouisblues,lxhn5y4,2024-11-16 15:52:38,WTF LINE BABY!!!
stlouisblues,lxhpfcl,2024-11-16 16:04:52,The one time I miss the game. I don’t think i can watch for the rest of the season
stlouisblues,lxhqdxh,2024-11-16 16:10:07,Blues beat the Bruins 3-2 in Boston like the Bruins beat the Blues 3-2 in St. Louis.
stlouisblues,lxho9j8,2024-11-16 15:58:33,i'm taking my flowers on this one. I called the Schenner point streak 3 games ago. I DID IT. YES THIS WIN IS for REENACTMENT!!!!!
stlouisblues,lxhozy7,2024-11-16 16:02:32,FREDERIC LOOKED LIKE A LOST PUPPY IN OT
stlouisblues,lxhmsk5,2024-11-16 15:50:39,"Hey let me be clear y'all. I'm not saying ""we should try to lose games"" (aka tanking). I'm saying I'm unbothered by losses at this point. Good game from the boys today and it's great to see Schenner get the gwg. LGB"
stlouisblues,lxjt14b,2024-11-17 00:04:00,Schenn could have scored 4 goals today.
stlouisblues,lxhnny8,2024-11-16 15:55:20,He's been downright badass the lat 4-5 games. In a time of dire need no less. Thank fuck Bannister actually gave him 18:50 today.
stlouisblues,lxhndbt,2024-11-16 15:53:44,Scoring his first goal was clearly a huge deal for him.  Now he looks more like the guy who won the Hobey Baker.
stlouisblues,lxhs2rf,2024-11-16 16:19:22,Adam Cracknell!
stlouisblues,lxhn4ys,2024-11-16 15:52:29,*Necessary Sorrowful Bellfrog* is back!
stlouisblues,lxhmu0h,2024-11-16 15:50:52,WE ARE BRINGING THIS BACK GOD DAMMIT!!!
stlouisblues,lxhn604,2024-11-16 15:52:38,Monster game from him especially in OT.
stlouisblues,lxhnvbq,2024-11-16 15:56:25,I think for the next game I am going to do a count of how many times he destroys something in the D zone takes the puck and moves us out of the zone. He's a horse and most NHL fans don;t even notice.
stlouisblues,lxic3h3,2024-11-16 18:13:56,He's been really good since #22 stepped in. Never thought I would be giving Suter credit this year but I am pleasantly surprised.
stlouisblues,lxhoh66,2024-11-16 15:59:43,he looks so good out there. its parayko  then him then faulk atm. Perunovich plays sheltered minutes tho but he looks so confident with the puck. Parayko's dick is so large this year with confidence too
stlouisblues,lxia2gw,2024-11-16 18:01:13,Harpoon makes delicious beer - worth the boos
stlouisblues,lxiei4h,2024-11-16 18:28:59,Team had to learn to play without them so we can thrive with them
stlouisblues,lxic5gj,2024-11-16 18:14:16,He got a few chances with faulk and they looked really good together
stlouisblues,lxjz107,2024-11-17 00:53:19,He was ballin'. Played like 9 1/2 minutes with Faulk and they owned their shifts.
stlouisblues,lxjeshd,2024-11-16 22:20:04,hope they lose all the rest of them and the rat get beat up every nite
stlouisblues,lxi9unr,2024-11-16 17:59:52,A lot of that is Perunovich finally playing up to his potential.
stlouisblues,lxi0z2s,2024-11-16 17:08:22,Some tough games coming up but I'm here for it.
stlouisblues,lxi93vz,2024-11-16 17:55:18,FTW!!!
stlouisblues,lxhyvkn,2024-11-16 16:56:46,Your sacrifice will not be forgotten. Thank you
stlouisblues,lxhqiwi,2024-11-16 16:10:51,If we sell off some forward vets at the deadline I'd certainly love to have him as a UFA.
stlouisblues,lxi1y1v,2024-11-16 17:13:49, only sad when we lose and look like we didn't care
stlouisblues,lxhorox,2024-11-16 16:01:18,Yall know I never had a doubt glad to see him showing his touch
stlouisblues,lxhr91y,2024-11-16 16:14:50,He’s great offensively and looked good today. His puck retrievals under pressure in D zone are bad. He looks scared. One pp is second he pulled up. Looks like he’s earning coach’s trust more lately. Hopefully he stays healthy. Will be running pp full time if he does.
stlouisblues,lxi4izy,2024-11-16 17:28:34,Haha shotout CPR line. Porter and Reaves were great w Cracknell!
stlouisblues,lxhn74m,2024-11-16 15:52:48,NECESSARY
stlouisblues,lxhoz4m,2024-11-16 16:02:25,Not today he didn't. He had 9:23 at 5v5 with Faulk and they crushed the minutes. 83% xG share 13-5 shot attempts. And of course 1-0 in goals.
stlouisblues,lxia6xy,2024-11-16 18:02:00,They do indeed. I live out here so it’s always fun to play spoiler.
stlouisblues,lxl95kt,2024-11-17 08:33:37,They better let him cook you don't accidentally win the Hobey Baker.
stlouisblues,lxjexvk,2024-11-16 22:21:05,The algorithm; I was just watching a highlight reel of him getting absolutely clobbered 
stlouisblues,lxjf4dy,2024-11-16 22:22:17,hope he can stay healthy all year
stlouisblues,lxjih5x,2024-11-16 22:45:09,Hmm. Nearly all of that happened last season when Faulk could barely move (147 out of 168 minutes together).
stlouisblues,lxhxk2v,2024-11-16 16:49:32,![gif](giphy|1zSz5MVw4zKg0|downsized)

stlouisblues,lxi4j03,2024-11-16 17:28:34,please no
stlouisblues,lxhvl4e,2024-11-16 16:38:35,Yeah not sure what bad puck retrievals or scared play you;re looking at. He's got a 63.7% xG share the last four games. He's damn near dominating his shifts lately.
stlouisblues,lxie6r8,2024-11-16 18:27:00,> His puck retrievals under pressure in D zone are bad.You sir are *deeply* confused.
stlouisblues,lxhnd0f,2024-11-16 15:53:41,SORROWFUL

stlouisblues,lxhmiue,2024-11-16 15:49:10,Schenner deserved that hell of a game from him today
stlouisblues,lxhb8yb,2024-11-16 14:47:29,I don’t care what anyone says Perunovich looks so much better over the last two weeks and can do things no other Blues d man can do. Just need to keep giving him some leash.
stlouisblues,lxhmima,2024-11-16 15:49:07,Why is it always Schenn in OT lol
stlouisblues,lxhmpmi,2024-11-16 15:50:11,Schenn is an absolute different animal in OT

stlouisblues,lxhmm4f,2024-11-16 15:49:40,Love a good Blues OT winner in Boston
stlouisblues,lxhaaud,2024-11-16 14:42:17,The score might not reflect it right now but this is one of the better games recently from the boys in Blue.
stlouisblues,lxhgzsm,2024-11-16 15:18:58,What a fucking play
stlouisblues,lxhmdu9,2024-11-16 15:48:23,If Frederick completes the hat trick I am going to commit sudoku

stlouisblues,lxhmmvj,2024-11-16 15:49:47,Schenn’s is money in OT from that spot.
stlouisblues,lxgy7cv,2024-11-16 13:37:42,Parayko is constantly a solid defenseman and uses his body so well on the boards.  The slander last year was ridiculous

stlouisblues,lxh8fl9,2024-11-16 14:32:18,Nice dish by Schueneman. He's not bad when he can activate without pressure.
stlouisblues,lxhgm1t,2024-11-16 15:16:52,YOU get a post and YOU get a post and EVERYBODY gets a post!
stlouisblues,lxhij79,2024-11-16 15:27:25,It never stops being fun seeing Walker being a head shorter than most of the other guys out there and him still looking like a fuckin pitbull on the half wall in a puck battle.
stlouisblues,lxhircv,2024-11-16 15:28:38,I really would appreciate it if one of our shooters won this thing. Kyrou Buch Schenn Neighbours Bolduc.

stlouisblues,lxgq6di,2024-11-16 12:55:13,Real question. I think binner is playing better than his save percentage. His instincts have been good but getting weird puck luck. What’s the discrepancy between him and hofers starts. I know hof will get tomorrow but it seems like binners geting 3-1 where last year it was 2-1
stlouisblues,lxgqx7j,2024-11-16 12:59:08,What a perfect time for Spectrum to be out at my residence.

stlouisblues,lxh07nu,2024-11-16 13:48:24,The back door steal of the puck was slick
stlouisblues,lxh5l1w,2024-11-16 14:17:03,3 wingers against an actual top line gonna have a tough time defensively
stlouisblues,lxhhlr2,2024-11-16 15:22:19,Yeah there was no need to flip it up so high. Keep it simple.
stlouisblues,lxhkb51,2024-11-16 15:37:04,Yes that's a spot you want your #1 center on the ice. Crazy I know
stlouisblues,lxhkhkg,2024-11-16 15:38:02,He's definitely gripping his stick too tight these days.
stlouisblues,lxhlduz,2024-11-16 15:42:56,Don't jinx it papi
stlouisblues,lxgqh0m,2024-11-16 12:56:47,I think it's about 3-1. They've both had shaky moments and great moments but the team is just not supporting either of them very well this year.
stlouisblues,lxgr910,2024-11-16 13:00:52,Today will make it 14 Binny starts to 5 Hofer starts. Both goalies have leaked a few softies but the structure in front of them runs so hot and cold.
stlouisblues,lxgr6a1,2024-11-16 13:00:27,I'm begging for another ISP to come to my neighborhood. Stuck with spectrum or satellite for now
stlouisblues,lxgy27g,2024-11-16 13:36:58,sighhh... fire Oli
stlouisblues,lxgxi3g,2024-11-16 13:34:03,Retrieve the puck when it’s in our net
stlouisblues,lxgxzn8,2024-11-16 13:36:36,Two goals against entirely on defensive gaffs Kessel not supporting Perunovich and then Schueneman doesn't pick up Frederic in front while Faulk screens binner
stlouisblues,lxh0gfo,2024-11-16 13:49:42,This is a peak bannister move Perunovich been playing alright? Why reward him let’s move up an NHL/AHL journeyman.
stlouisblues,lxh0d52,2024-11-16 13:49:14,Some of it deservedly so.  I feel like he could have half a dozen goals if he had been sharper with his hands (just not fumbling it or getting to the puck late) 
stlouisblues,lxh0oc5,2024-11-16 13:50:54,I think so. Nice to see it tried. Better than keeping the forward lines on a rotating conveyor belt
stlouisblues,lxh1mhs,2024-11-16 13:55:58,Would be very on brand for 24-25 Blues hockey
stlouisblues,lxh411f,2024-11-16 14:08:47,As long as we never let Joseph woll score on us I'll be ok
stlouisblues,lxh45uc,2024-11-16 14:09:29,I think a big part of it is that he's back in the middle 6 in stead of being asked to play top line anything like he was for a bit there.
stlouisblues,lxh7cfx,2024-11-16 14:26:29,Worst game score of any Dman in the league last week
stlouisblues,lxha8hu,2024-11-16 14:41:57,Quick change followed by a stretch pass to Kyrou for a nasty goal has been my favorite recurring move this season.Been one of the only good moves this season lol.
stlouisblues,lxhbej8,2024-11-16 14:48:19,In favor of who? Scotty P might've waved help off the ice off but he did go straight to the locker room and we're already short defensemen as is.
stlouisblues,lxhbwug,2024-11-16 14:51:04,Down by 1 goal after another soft but consistent goalie interference call but otherwise this is one of the better games in recent memory.
stlouisblues,lxhggg3,2024-11-16 15:16:00,https://records.nhl.com/stl/records/team-records/losing-streaks/longest-losing-streak-one-season
stlouisblues,lxhgf0c,2024-11-16 15:15:46,8? It happened 2 years ago
stlouisblues,lxhkc8p,2024-11-16 15:37:14,And the Sinclair Slate is getting a reboot.
stlouisblues,lxg4wg7,2024-11-16 11:00:33,He’s in today! Along with Schueneman
stlouisblues,lxg1b2t,2024-11-16 10:40:37,PO is listed as day-to-day.  But then again aren't we all.
stlouisblues,lxgu9bq,2024-11-16 13:16:56,This one is an NHL network game unless you're in market
stlouisblues,lxgv9aw,2024-11-16 13:22:15,It’s incredibly easy walsh
stlouisblues,lxgv9qa,2024-11-16 13:22:19,He was not consistently in the right spot until 3 games ago
stlouisblues,lxhg4c4,2024-11-16 15:14:07,He's still young so growing pains were expected he has a lot of good flashes so I'm hopeful he can put it all together sooner than later
stlouisblues,lxhhoof,2024-11-16 15:22:46,He needs his hands to catch up to his feet.
stlouisblues,lxhjgy1,2024-11-16 15:32:34,Well aren't you a negative Nancy
stlouisblues,lxhjgrm,2024-11-16 15:32:32,Turtle with the 4th line for the last 3 mins and lose in regulation. Book it.
stlouisblues,lxhhox6,2024-11-16 15:22:48,It's that Blues kind of good though. Just quietly making good plays and grinding it out.
stlouisblues,lxgygs7,2024-11-16 13:39:06,You right you right
stlouisblues,lxgyqb9,2024-11-16 13:40:30,Heh. There's still Blues fans who scream to get rid of him.
stlouisblues,lxgyxvf,2024-11-16 13:41:39,Two years ago his play sucked and people didn't realize how bad the back was till towards the end of the year
stlouisblues,lxhdw7s,2024-11-16 15:01:51,The only logical answer
stlouisblues,lxhilo0,2024-11-16 15:27:48,"That's not what we meant by ""keep up the WTF line"" Drew. We want to *see* WTF not *say* WTF."
stlouisblues,lxhi8hv,2024-11-16 15:25:46,Split right down the middle.
stlouisblues,lxhkwo3,2024-11-16 15:40:20,It's their own commentators
stlouisblues,lxh9012,2024-11-16 14:35:21,100% they would have upheld it if we challenged. I’m not a fan of slight incidental contact being interference but that’s the way they’re calling it. 
stlouisblues,lxhi2zd,2024-11-16 15:24:54,Time to bring the W to the Lou I guess?
stlouisblues,lxglgki,2024-11-16 12:30:16,:/ to the seas I go
stlouisblues,lxh712v,2024-11-16 14:24:49,Holy shit that's one every three games. This bad luck won't last.
stlouisblues,lxhn425,2024-11-16 15:52:21,Not usually.Edit: I went and checked. The Blues have gone to OT with Walks in the lineup 38 times and he has played a total of 45 seconds of OT which came on one shift back in 21/22.
stlouisblues,lxgl36a,2024-11-16 12:28:18,Same I was up late late between the Jake Paul Mike Tyson fiasco and then just staying up lol I luckily took the pups out around 230 before going to bed so they let me sleep in a little
stlouisblues,lxgtr52,2024-11-16 13:14:16,![gif](giphy|Nl6T837bDWE1DPczq3|downsized)
stlouisblues,lxgv9q0,2024-11-16 13:22:19,I think Scandy's turnover phase was more sloppiness than laziness. He wasn't a lazy player. Suter is just lollygagging half the time. No urgency.
stlouisblues,lxgyejv,2024-11-16 13:38:46,He upgraded to the 1 gigabit speed
stlouisblues,lxh76u6,2024-11-16 14:25:40,Touché. All the Suter giveaways don;t help either.
stlouisblues,lxgycbd,2024-11-16 13:38:26,I still stand by that lol
stlouisblues,lxgxtat,2024-11-16 13:35:39,to be fair that is pretty important
stlouisblues,lxgywyy,2024-11-16 13:41:31,Schueneman also made a lazy play with the puck to start the sequence.
stlouisblues,lxh1iy2,2024-11-16 13:55:26,Sometimes it's hard to tell with the way he refuses to stick to a consistent rotation or line roll.
stlouisblues,lxh7mtz,2024-11-16 14:28:03,He's something like -9 in the last four games. And it's well deserved too.
stlouisblues,lxhblul,2024-11-16 14:49:25,To be fair there were only like 10 seconds or so left on the ice after that cross check.
stlouisblues,lxhc4jd,2024-11-16 14:52:14,He seemed okay when he got up on that second camera angle. But yeah he needs to be playing at least as much as Suter right now.
stlouisblues,lxhgzyg,2024-11-16 15:18:59,Glad to see I was correct
stlouisblues,lxhkgfs,2024-11-16 15:37:52,That's better!
stlouisblues,lxg1dgv,2024-11-16 10:40:58,My mental health due to this team is
stlouisblues,lxgvsjn,2024-11-16 13:25:05,Nah he had that goaline game tying opportunity earlier in the year and the puck jumped on him. He’s had a couple Swiss cheese sticks. I can count lime 4 points that were gimmes he should have. If they just let him play with saad and they could 3rd line it they would be dynamite. But alas we have what we have
stlouisblues,lxhjt52,2024-11-16 15:34:23,Haha hey I'm still watching games even though we are beat up and not looking very good. This season doesn't have to be gone but something REALLY has to change if it isn't. I say we put our heads down and try and get a good pick. The hockey gods have kinda decided that for us with all the injuries.
stlouisblues,lxhjyny,2024-11-16 15:35:15,Don't forget we could also have all the momentum and then give one up outta nowhere.
stlouisblues,lxhi607,2024-11-16 15:25:24,The kind of good that tires the other team out and forces them to make mistakes. I'll take it.
stlouisblues,lxgyugp,2024-11-16 13:41:08,Are we getting like 3 firsts a prospect and an NHL body in return?
stlouisblues,lxgzsdn,2024-11-16 13:46:10,Yeah the back injury wasn't taken nearly as seriously as it should have
stlouisblues,lxgz7kg,2024-11-16 13:43:05,No arguments here the entire blue line was abysmal two years ago
stlouisblues,lxhe35n,2024-11-16 15:02:55,Say what you will about Bannister but the guy does a great job tanking lol. It almost feels intentional at this point.
stlouisblues,lxhilhq,2024-11-16 15:27:46,Neighker or Walbours?
stlouisblues,lxh98az,2024-11-16 14:36:36,I guess the goalies advocated for more protection but I bet they have to course correct at some point.
stlouisblues,lxgmzni,2024-11-16 12:38:25,Ahoy matey
stlouisblues,lxhnkcx,2024-11-16 15:54:47,Cheers for checking!
stlouisblues,lxgqss0,2024-11-16 12:58:29,This one has a military schedule to keep dammit. Get up human. Hup hup. 
stlouisblues,lxgwawb,2024-11-16 13:27:47,Oh yeah it was a skill thing with Scandella never an effort problem
stlouisblues,lxgynmr,2024-11-16 13:40:07,Makes sense it'd be higher performant at noon. More bandwidth on the network than those evening games
stlouisblues,lxh7knf,2024-11-16 14:27:43,That's just a part of life at this point unfortunately
stlouisblues,lxhd2j5,2024-11-16 14:57:21,I mean that's fair but the way this season has gone I'm assuming even guys still on the ice are injured lol.
stlouisblues,lxgwke3,2024-11-16 13:29:10,When he was on the top line he looked like ass because he couldn't keep up with play I agree when he's got more equal matchups he isn't out of position but he's been asked to play too hard of match ups due to injuries and looked like shit in those situations
stlouisblues,lxhku8f,2024-11-16 15:39:57,"I know a lot of the more ""long term strategy"" fans frequently say we should tank for a pick. I will never support that. Watching a team tank is not fun. I'd rather we always do the best we can and keep a scrappy culture alive instead.I do agree that this year has been snake bitten with injuries and we need to really work on our strategy and some coaching decisions have been baffling."
stlouisblues,lxgz3ns,2024-11-16 13:42:29,Heh. Nah they think getting rid of his contract is the real benefit. People who just have no clue and operate only on weird bias.
stlouisblues,lxhe95b,2024-11-16 15:03:51,Bannister was the tank commander all along and none of us realized it
stlouisblues,lxhiqv0,2024-11-16 15:28:34,Careful saying that first one out loud
stlouisblues,lxhj1ca,2024-11-16 15:30:11,Considering nobody's worn 66 for us the first one.Edit: or as pointed out below maybe not...
stlouisblues,lxha3d5,2024-11-16 14:41:12,I’d wager it’s the most hated rule in the NHL simply because of the ambiguity of it. I hope they amend it at some point at least to make it more black and white. 
stlouisblues,lxgwp2l,2024-11-16 13:29:51,Yup. But he was overly maligned too. Probably due to his contract. The majority of his Blues time he was a damn good 3LD/PK ace we could not keep in one piece.
stlouisblues,lxhllxv,2024-11-16 15:44:11,I mean I kinda said that did I not? We've had a couple really terrible games but the losses have mostly been close. Just keep doing what we're doing. We don't have to get shellacked (8-1) every night but seeing some good things (Broberg looking great and finding a great 3rd line in the WTF line) is enough to make me happy. These losses are doing the best we can.
stlouisblues,lxgzafw,2024-11-16 13:43:31,Yeah I don't agree with that line of thinking at all lol
stlouisblues,lxhen26,2024-11-16 15:06:01,Bannister playing 1D chess
stlouisblues,lxhiyq3,2024-11-16 15:29:48, yeah hadn't thought of that...
stlouisblues,lxhj72r,2024-11-16 15:31:04,What's up my Neighker? 
stlouisblues,lxgxlxx,2024-11-16 13:34:37,My complaint was always that he was overpaid
stlouisblues,lxhn7nq,2024-11-16 15:52:53,"I took the ""I say we put our heads down and try and get a good pick"" as saying we should tank for a draft pick may have misunderstood what you meant."
stlouisblues,lxh0iqk,2024-11-16 13:50:03,Some folks will never forgive him for not being as mean as Pronger. As if so many are or something. :D
stlouisblues,lxhjdv1,2024-11-16 15:32:05,![gif](giphy|hpAMh2sBYpsmFhSRPI)
stlouisblues,lxho30c,2024-11-16 15:57:35,It's all good brother. As long as we're still Blues fans at the end of the day we're running in the same direction.
stlouisblues,lxh15ts,2024-11-16 13:53:31,And in all fairness to parayko he's absolutely gotten more physical in the last two years this year especially it's been noticable. I think for all my complaints about Suter he's brought out a bit of the snarl in parayko
stlouisblues,lxh1clx,2024-11-16 13:54:29,Yeeeep. They don;t care or notice.
stlouisblues,lxd0cjg,2024-11-15 20:03:09,Just being honest. Powder blue on the navy isn’t for me. Solid navy on this for a color rush type of deal would slap though!
stlouisblues,lxcm2bi,2024-11-15 18:34:53,Thanks for the feedback on the previous version!
stlouisblues,lxdame6,2024-11-15 21:09:15,I Iike this one better.
stlouisblues,lxdl55l,2024-11-15 22:19:22,I like it!
stlouisblues,lxecmbg,2024-11-16 01:54:52,This is pretty cool
stlouisblues,lxd53ls,2024-11-15 20:33:48,Better but I agree with the person on the last one who said it looks pretty Thrasher-y.
stlouisblues,lxcob85,2024-11-15 18:48:36,I don't feel like we need 2 different powder blue jerseys. I would rather they go with a solid royal blue and ditch the black yolks.
stlouisblues,lxdaqdw,2024-11-15 21:09:59,I like the uniform that makes us win more.
stlouisblues,lxdb1ty,2024-11-15 21:12:08,I don't not dig it.  Kinda like the darker vibe.  And I sure as hell couldn't design anything better so big ups to ya.
stlouisblues,lxdp9eh,2024-11-15 22:46:31,I think it’s great. Maines navy powder looks great too
stlouisblues,lxf3mg0,2024-11-16 06:41:45,Love the yellow logo. Nice change. The nameplate and C/A should prolly just be white tho. Too hard to see
stlouisblues,lxfggdj,2024-11-16 08:27:45,You would love the Rams sub during the offseasonEdit: this looks so good tho
stlouisblues,lxg7wzb,2024-11-16 11:17:01,Bolder colors are back in style. I’d lean more towards a solid royal blue and gold design similar on a late 80s early 90s blues jersey template.
stlouisblues,lxmfkzh,2024-11-17 12:48:01,"It's a creative concept so I applaud you for that but the ""blue note"" should forever be blue. Not a fan of the design on the shorts. Far too 90s third jersey for me. I do like the striping/piping design you used here."
stlouisblues,lxnurao,2024-11-17 17:22:37,Simple but still different. I like it!
stlouisblues,lxo019h,2024-11-17 17:52:29,GET RID OF THE NAVY!
stlouisblues,lxd1wbn,2024-11-15 20:13:11,Or a navy and gold
stlouisblues,lxemaxu,2024-11-16 03:37:53,The 09 navy alt jerseys were great and the logo they used with the arch was one of my favorites
stlouisblues,lxde58w,2024-11-15 21:32:38,Or for a contemporary comparison it looks a lot like a Utah alternate with a Blues logo slapped on it.
stlouisblues,lxm2kih,2024-11-17 11:35:56,This is the best answer
stlouisblues,lxd31lt,2024-11-15 20:20:30,That would also look extremely good. IMO I think they should lean more into the gold color more. It would be interesting at the very least
stlouisblues,lxf8x65,2024-11-16 07:29:11,At least for color rush
stlouisblues,lxbzvuq,2024-11-15 16:31:45,Not only one of my favorite players but god damn if 77 also doesn't look amazing on a jersey.
stlouisblues,lxbrflw,2024-11-15 15:48:52,I loved Turgeon as a player. Was so excited when the Blues acquired him
stlouisblues,lxc2jlv,2024-11-15 16:45:23,I'll never forget struggling to stay awake for that OT game against the Coyotes and him scoring the game winner and me jumping out of bed.
stlouisblues,lxc5469,2024-11-15 16:58:42,Favorite Blue! That visor was so cool
stlouisblues,lxca58z,2024-11-15 17:26:02,Loved when we had Pierre on the team.  I have his jersey when he played for the Islanders in the early 90s.
stlouisblues,lxciuaq,2024-11-15 18:15:39,My all-time favorite Blue. Still have two of his jerseys.
stlouisblues,lxdbgd9,2024-11-15 21:14:48,Seen a bunch of these. Frenchie does his sitting at a bar. Much Respect!!
stlouisblues,lxk0ev9,2024-11-17 01:05:09,He was my favorite as a kid. A friend of my parents got a signed puck from him addressed to me I love it
stlouisblues,lxdb8il,2024-11-15 21:13:22,He jumped as you jumped :)
stlouisblues,lxdeazj,2024-11-15 21:33:42,TBH one of the most iconic goals in team history!
stlouisblues,lxat3mj,2024-11-15 12:55:58,So we bring up Loof for a paycheck? And then send him down to bring up Schueneman?
stlouisblues,lxanc65,2024-11-15 12:27:23,Loof has been sent down. My 5th favorite Soundgarden song has been called up.
stlouisblues,lxcfln7,2024-11-15 17:56:40,The call we've call up been waiting for.
stlouisblues,lxbvj28,2024-11-15 16:09:36,Loof would have probably gone in as a third pairing guy. Spoonman might make more sense in the top 4 (older more NHL experience) for the time being.
stlouisblues,lxanpgx,2024-11-15 12:29:13,My thiiiiird favorite civil engineer
stlouisblues,lxaskvi,2024-11-15 12:53:23,Fuck Jeff Goldblum man
stlouisblues,lxat4sv,2024-11-15 12:56:08,That’s what I said!
stlouisblues,lxazk58,2024-11-15 13:27:59,I thought hurricane season was over!
stlouisblues,lxbgg5a,2024-11-15 14:53:01,Nowhere and Quizno’s
stlouisblues,lx9ibl4,2024-11-15 08:55:43,25th in the league 17 games in. Do we really expect this team to compete for a wild card spot? Early on I believed it but I can’t even fathom it now.
stlouisblues,lxabsau,2024-11-15 11:30:23,They can’t hurt us today!
stlouisblues,lxam7ig,2024-11-15 12:21:47,I'm at the point where I'm looking for positives to take away from games. Big takeaway last night was that Schenn and Saad had their best games of the year. If they can keep up a reasonably good level of play that's a great sign that they aren't completely cooked. Schenn will be on this team for a long time and if Saad continues to show some scoring touch we can probably get back a decent trade return after the all star break.
stlouisblues,lx9js1l,2024-11-15 09:04:14,Why is this team just so damn bumbling? Like I’ve watched other bad teams this season and none look as bumbling. Like how many times do we see them *almost* make a good play only for the pass to be off the mark or the receiver fumble it or lose the handle or whiff on it? It’s like it’s a hot potato nobody is comfortable with the puck on their stick. 
stlouisblues,lxbsirs,2024-11-15 15:54:24,Early prospect recap time! **Ivan Vorboyov** snapped a 13-game goal drought to put Vityaz up 3-1 in a game they'd eventually lose 6-4 at Dinamo Minsk. Working hard on the forecheck he wristed home for his 6th of the season. He had 3 SOG 2 hits and 3 takeaways in 16:05 ice time.The goal: [https://youtu.be/k1wIugFMC4M?si=BWkkiJOZ\_0z6iqGY&t=496](https://youtu.be/k1wIugFMC4M?si=BWkkiJOZ_0z6iqGY&t=496)From what I can see **Ondrej Kos** was a healthy scratch in Ilves' 4-0 win. Of course it's also possible he picked up a ding in practice and I just don't know where to look in Finnish. I kinda wonder if I missed something because he was starting to contribute more recently. I'll keep my eye out for news.Prospects in action later today: Stancl Mrsic Jecho McIsaac Burns Mayich Dorion & the Springfield bunch.
stlouisblues,lx9gsxv,2024-11-15 08:46:43,I hope drew bannister loves reading in the media how smart the Sabres were for delaying the penalty for a minute at the end of regulation while he called the players off so he could earn a point. [THE SABRES STRATEGICALLY DELAY THEIR POWER PLAY INTO OT AND COME UP WITH THE W](https://x.com/br_openice/status/1857262989788750013?s=46&t=Xn0juU2C4hEaElfmeGb4jQ)
stlouisblues,lx9y7hy,2024-11-15 10:22:39,There were a lot of things that needed to go exactly right for the Blues to have even a whiff of the playoffs and it's all gone exactly wrong. I think last year's team (and outlandishly good goaltending) deluded fans into thinking the Blues are closer than they really are to being in the playoffs again but we needed a lot of things to go right for the slim chance we had.Even with a healthy lineup we really needed Buch to be an effective second line center especially because he is one of the best wingers in the league and the Blues are losing him in that spot. So when it doesn't work you not only have a shitty second line but you lose out on his offense. That clearly hasn't worked well. We really needed to stay healthy and well the fact that the return of Nick freaking Leddy would be an upgrade over the current situation is not good. We really needed to shore up an already bad defense and hey Broberg has been as good as advertised but also see above. He's been out and will be for a while. And oh man now Ryan Suter is getting top 4 minutes and last night the Blues had to resort to giving him Pronger minutes. Woof. And our goaltending needed to be excellent. Not just solid. Vezina caliber. Binnington's save percentage the first few games last year was something stupid high over .970 and he was excellent all year. Not near that level so far this year. Any one of those things going sideways would have been enough to derail any wild card hopes imo because the depth on this team was never great but with all of them going wrong this is a lottery team. Everyone can be mad at Bannister - and yeah he does suck as a coach - but he's maybe like 5 percent of the Blues problems right now.
stlouisblues,lxagc49,2024-11-15 11:52:47,Let's have some good cheer folks.  I see that Dalibor Dvorsky has 6G and 4A through 13 in the AHL:   [https://www.nhl.com/player/dalibor-dvorsky-8484164](https://www.nhl.com/player/dalibor-dvorsky-8484164)
stlouisblues,lxe87hq,2024-11-16 01:14:32,Holy fucking shitballs I just now realized that Dipshit Bannister played Suter 33 minutes against Buffalo. THIRTY. THREE. Two and a half more than Colt. Perunovich (who was again our on ice xG share leader) and Kessel only got 13. When we were down to five Dmen. Get that fucking sack of idiocy outta here. NOW. For the love of all that is good and holy.
stlouisblues,lxdwyrp,2024-11-15 23:41:13,Let's start the prospect recap with Springfield who won 4-3 lots of guys to shout out after a sorely needed W.\- **Aleksanteri Kaskimaki** now has six points during his four-game point streak after notching two assists. He was also a +2 and is +6 during the point streak.\- **Marcus Sylvegard** is also suddenly getting hot. He had two goals including the winner from 4 SOG and was a +2. He has five points and a +4 in his last three games.\- **Dalibor Dvorsky** (who is currently centering the two forwards listed above) set up the winner and was a +2 with 3 SOG. After a few iffy defensive outings at the start Dvorsky is now +5 in his last seven games.\- **Colton Ellis** is heating up in goal he made 32 saves for the win raising his save pct. to .919.\- **Nikita Alexandrov** is also on a roll and he also scored a goal. Seeing as how we need centers might be time for a call. Dude has goals in three of his last four games and seven points in his last six.\- **Tyler Tucker** returned from injury with a busy night. In his first game since Oct 26 the Dman put up a goal from 3 SOG a +2 (his first game as a plus since opening night) and a fight.\- **Leo Loof** didn;t show any bruised feelings over his cup of coffee notching an assist and a +1.\- **Simon Robertsson** also returned from injury with 2 SOG and a -1.Full highlights: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBC\_5phgp9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBC_5phgp9Y)\- **Tomas Mrsic** was the #1 star and hat trick hero in Prince Albert Raiders' 5-3 win. He scored the game's opening goal less than a minute in with a dazzling solo end to end effort then saved the best for last with two PPGs in the last three minutes of the game (one a sneaky flutter job that took a kind carom the other an ENG) to break a 3-3 deadlock. He was a +1 with 8 SOG. He now has 11g 10a 21pts in 15 games and is tied for the WHL lead with 7 PPG.The goals: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vELREd6XvU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vELREd6XvU)\- Kingston captain **Quinton Burns** assisted on the opening goal and was a +2 as the OHL Eastern Conference leaders sailed 7-1. They've won four in a row.\- I am not at all sure how he managed this but **Will McIsaac** was a +2 in Spokane's 7-2 loss. He's now tied for the team +/- lead at +8.\- **Adam Jecho** had 4 SOG in Edmonton Oil Kings' 4-3 loss.\- **Matthew Mayich** had 4 SOG in Ottawa 67s 3-2 shootout loss.\- Wearing an A **Antoine Dorion** was a -1 and won just 2 of 10 draws in Quebec's 6-4 loss. He has been held pointless in all six November games so far.Finally I missed this on Wednesday...https://preview.redd.it/wro5jjcev61e1.jpeg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4184ff9cbca89f4cca80c7bfa634d92758951da
stlouisblues,lxa0uda,2024-11-15 10:36:03,We are playing WAY worse than we should be. We are not this bad. There is something underlying this lack of effort and cohesiveness that needs to be addressed. If nothing is addressed I honestly believe we will finish last. LGB
stlouisblues,lxafg9h,2024-11-15 11:48:29,Leo Loof is already being sent back down? Wutt
stlouisblues,lxa9lq9,2024-11-15 11:19:37,Do you guys think snuggerud is looking at this team and thinking he wants no part in it? Or do you think he looks at and sees an almost guaranteed opportunity in the top 6 maybe even top line
stlouisblues,lxa7rsn,2024-11-15 11:10:39,What’s up with sending Loof back down and calling up Schueneman? Also should we just let kyrou try to center that top line with neighbors and buch? I’m still new to hockey and the blues in case anything is a dumb question
stlouisblues,lxam54l,2024-11-15 12:21:26,Once again campaigning for DA to trade for Jiricek. In the right age range a position our prospect pool is desperately in need of our entire blue line is already dead so he's going to get the NHL minutes he wants. I think it's the type of deal we should be making right now.
stlouisblues,lxaa4rh,2024-11-15 11:22:13,The underlying numbers don’t look great. They may even be over-performing at 25th honestly.The head coach is playing Nathan Walker as much as Jordan Kyrou. And Buchnevich is averaging one less minute of TOI per night than last season somehow. Seems like they aren’t that concerned with winning with the deployment choices we’re seeing I think
stlouisblues,lx9l8by,2024-11-15 09:12:40,Maybe I’m delusional but I think if this team stayed completely healthy they would have been in the hunt at least. But that was the only way and the season has been pretty brutal on injuries exposing all the cracks this team has. I think they’ll continue to dig a big hole. Then they’ll play up and down hockey once everybody is back leading to a disappointing 20-25th place finish. 
stlouisblues,lxa6upy,2024-11-15 11:06:03,I believe that we will make the playoffs until the math says it’s a lottery ticket and that’s because we were last overall and won a cup. Once the odds gets super low like days prior to elimination I swallow that pill and start googling draft picks. Hockey is weird.
stlouisblues,lxbsrtj,2024-11-15 15:55:40,Not really fair to judge with Thomas and Brobs out for a few more weeks (presumably). And of course the coach is a massive handicap.
stlouisblues,lxap4ba,2024-11-15 12:36:12,Schenn looked like he turned back the clock last night Saad is just a streaky player so hopefully he can get hot right around the deadline
stlouisblues,lxbta10,2024-11-15 15:58:15,Yeah it's really infuriating that we wasted an outstanding effort from Schenn. Like WTF guys? That's only gonna happen like 7 times a season.
stlouisblues,lxbs7ap,2024-11-15 15:52:46,I’ve noticed this for years. Even in that 21-22 season they sucked at passing the puck like they were just going through the motions early on
stlouisblues,lx9t621,2024-11-15 09:56:28,Agree it’s so frustrating. I’ve also never seen a team just randomly slip and fall as much as these guys do. I cannot figure out why but if I had to guess it would be a confidence issue.
stlouisblues,lxcifyv,2024-11-15 18:13:20,Quick little Springfield update: **Simon Robertsson** and **Tyler Tucker** will both return to the lineup tonight.
stlouisblues,lx9o7q7,2024-11-15 09:29:29,It was 100% the correct decision for the sabres to do that and it was probably 90% the correct decision imo for the blues to lay off too assuming their goal is to get as many points as they can this year.I’m trying to imagine the reaction here if the blues desperately went to touch the puck for some reason with 50 seconds left in regulation then gave up a PP goal with like 15 seconds left in the 3rd period. If we are already at the point of the year where getting a “loser point” doesn't matter and all we want is aggressive play regardless of the strategic situation then we should just start pulling the goalie late in tie games or in OT too. There are legitimate criticisms that can be given of bannister and the blues effort but I just don’t understand why this decision in particular was bad.
stlouisblues,lxb47ex,2024-11-15 13:50:51,to add to your point about goaltending 55 goalies have played at least 5 games. Based on GSAA Hofer is 44th (-3.8) and Binner is 49th (-4.7).
stlouisblues,lxe5z6y,2024-11-16 00:56:17,Dvorsky just keeps looking better every game to meove seeing the production from the prospects top to bottom
stlouisblues,lxaj21u,2024-11-15 12:06:06,??? Without our best player and probably 2nd best defenseman you think this roster is anything other than a fringe playoff team? 
stlouisblues,lxbtf7s,2024-11-15 15:58:59,Bannister man. It;s not that difficult. He's a trainwreck.
stlouisblues,lxbtw3f,2024-11-15 16:01:18,We're weird by policy.
stlouisblues,lxb4eg3,2024-11-15 13:51:49,Without knowing him of course: The later. Opportunity. There’s a lot of teams who have “that guy”. We don’t kinda. There’s room for one at least.  The better the role snuggerud gets early in his career the bigger his career earnings. (By a lot in many cases)
stlouisblues,lxbtsce,2024-11-15 16:00:48,NO. He's not going to ditch us. You're just looking for things to worry about which I totally get. But cmon people. Keep it together.
stlouisblues,lxahd04,2024-11-15 11:57:48,I’m sorry but this is laughably out of touch… You think he’s some hockey god that can score at will in the NHL? He hasn’t played a minute of professional hockey. All he should be focused on is getting better. You’re a player not a coach or GM. Stay in your lane. The blues aren’t even a dumpster fire like some other sports franchises. Theyre 5 years removed from a Stanley cup with a well respected GM. 
stlouisblues,lxcevqe,2024-11-15 17:52:31,Not sure about the first one but I *think* that since they are just calling up the 7th dman as an emergency backup they are giving them both a game in that slot so they get the extra paycheck. No one has really talked much about trying Kyrou at center. I'd be curious to see if it works but the team seems committed to Buch in that spot. Don't think it would make a massive difference tbh.
stlouisblues,lxbtkbm,2024-11-15 15:59:42,And what are you offering? Remember Jiricek is an RD not an LD.
stlouisblues,lxawyzv,2024-11-15 13:15:16,I was filled with hope as the season started. That hope has faded. I really would love it if the Blues made it into the playoffs even as a wild card team but right now my vibe is no.Just like the Cardinals and their grand plan for 2025 \[no hope\] I wanted the Blues to be that team that I knew was going to make the playoffs \[because once you get in anything can happen\]
stlouisblues,lx9xj8n,2024-11-15 10:19:14,I know it’s fairly early on but if this is going to be the story this season then I’m going to embrace the low standing. Ik we wanted to be competitive but it’s probably not happening.
stlouisblues,lxafe3q,2024-11-15 11:48:12,I’d rather shoot my shot with 50 seconds of 5 on 4 and then 1 minute of 4 on 3 than 2 straight minutes of 4 on 3 in OT. Just seems like we’re playing scared
stlouisblues,lxaln08,2024-11-15 12:18:56,Dude so can not abide by that decision. Turtling for a point is no way to get in the playoffs. It is not a viable solution for an nhl team on any level. If you’re gonna go down at least go down fighting. It sends a terrible message to the team and is unfair to the players who need to foster a culture of competition.
stlouisblues,lxbsxi0,2024-11-15 15:56:29,It was weakness from Bannister. Full stop. A ka the usual.
stlouisblues,lxb743x,2024-11-15 14:05:13,Yeah. Those numbers don't surprise me. Binnington (and Hofer) were truly great last season. The two regular seasons prior to that season were rough for goaltending which is an unpopular opinion around these parts but when the coach was justifiably giving more starts to Ville freaking Husso it's not great!
stlouisblues,lxe6gyc,2024-11-16 01:00:11,Almost everyone who gets shifted onto his wing starts heating up. Always a good sign.
stlouisblues,lxam8sh,2024-11-15 12:21:58,No I don’t but the lack of effort and compete is highly visible. I don’t see the effort or decision making in the right place. It’s a deeper locker room problem imo
stlouisblues,lxakevm,2024-11-15 12:12:50,He is currently getting paid to play college hockey so technically he is playing professionally. Did I say he can score goals at will? We need goals he's good at scoring goals.  
stlouisblues,lxe6819,2024-11-16 00:58:14,Bolduc+ if he's not interesting enough I'm ok moving neighbours. Don't give a shit that everyone's going to act like its a sin. We have plenty of middle 6 wingers in the waiting.
stlouisblues,lxfh1qx,2024-11-16 08:31:55,It’s fine some guys that need minutes will see a lot of minutes this year. Next season they will hopefully see production from some of the top prospects to replace the points lost from Perron ROR and Tarasenko.
stlouisblues,lxayh8d,2024-11-15 13:22:42,I agree with you and BEFORE the outcome of this game. I openly stated why aren't they going for the puck. That's insane to let the Sabres have :56 seconds of free time as this penalty is going to lead to a 4v3 OT. Sure you savored a point but if you are a serious team you need to get 2 points. So letting the Sabres have that sort of advantage without shaving the time down as much as you could to me seems lazy or we are playing scared. The outcome seemed almost predicted but you have to wonder if the blues burned off let's say 40 seconds of that penalty would that have changed this outcome. Who knows but maybe this game was a lesson in you have to be aggressive next time because this tactic of laying off got you burned in OT
stlouisblues,lxau741,2024-11-15 13:01:25,Not sure I follow this. Taking a guaranteed point that the other team is ceding to you is not turtling or cowardly - getting as many points as you can is literally how you get to the playoffs. Teams sit on the puck all the time late in tied games to get the guaranteed point. Like I said I assume you’ll advocate for aggressive pulling of the goalie late in tie games or OT - teams not doing this are cowardly for playing it safe I guess.I don’t understand why deciding to kill the penalty in OT instead of half in regulation is being portrayed as not “going down fighting”. Ha it’s not like the blues just gave them the goal in OT. I assume they were trying to kill it off and then win the game.Again there are problems with this team and maybe I’m just seeing it differently than others but this seems like the correct decision to me.
stlouisblues,lxe7uv1,2024-11-16 01:11:32,Uhh yeah so does Columbus. :D
stlouisblues,lxayqxg,2024-11-15 13:24:01,I think it’s easier to kill a minute of penalty 5 on 4 and 1 minute of 4 on 3 than kill 2 minutes of 4 on 3. Our pk hasn’t been that bad and think it would have gave us better to win. I’d rather see them go for the win for 2 points not settle for 1 which it seemed like they did. It seemed like everyone knew they wouldn’t kill 2 minutes in ot.
stlouisblues,lxe81qy,2024-11-16 01:13:10,Then honestly move Kyrou and take multiple of their prospects at this point but a guy with attitude problems (Jiricek) is not going to get the typical 6oa rhd haul
stlouisblues,lxe957k,2024-11-16 01:22:35,And if he has attitude problems you think he should fetch Kyrou??? Cmon man.
stlouisblues,lxeim6p,2024-11-16 02:57:10,No it's Jiricek plus at that point but I'm asking for Lindstrom
stlouisblues,lx7d4n9,2024-11-14 22:32:05,The fact that bannister let them hang back on the delayed penalty tells you everything you need to know. He’s happy with a point. Small victories? If he wasn’t furious it’s inexcusable.
stlouisblues,lx7bnyw,2024-11-14 22:23:27,I know it isn't the most important thing this season but I really hope Bannister is not the long term plan for this team. Feels like the attention to detail mental lapses absolute gaps in effort for periods at a time are serious concerns and thats not a player skill issue.
stlouisblues,lx7c18o,2024-11-14 22:25:42,If the blues were showing improvised habits I’d be okay with bannister but we aren’t. There’s legit just no redeeming qualities I can see in him rn.
stlouisblues,lx7bpsl,2024-11-14 22:23:45,Why...on earth...did they not put on pressure on and try to regain the puck at the end of regulation to break up the power play before OT?
stlouisblues,lx7bybq,2024-11-14 22:25:13,Prospect recap time:\- Jimmy Snuggs with two primary assists in the game's first six minutes including one on the PP as #3 Minnesota win 5-3. He now has four multipoint games with at least 5 SOG in his last five games.
stlouisblues,lx7ci5t,2024-11-14 22:28:21,[deleted]
stlouisblues,lx7cbo6,2024-11-14 22:27:18,Drew Bannister sat on that bench and....yeah then the game was over.
stlouisblues,lx7br51,2024-11-14 22:24:00,What's Ken Hitchcock doing these days?
stlouisblues,lx7mbgp,2024-11-14 23:28:07,I can’t with this team anymore.  I’m used to up and downs but Jesus the 3rd period was a clusterfuck of missed passes poor puck control and just overall apathy to what was at stake.  Binnington left out to dry again although he has his own issues with overcommitting to shots putting him out of position overall poor effort for yet another loss.
stlouisblues,lx7f2bl,2024-11-14 22:43:24,We were a fringe playoff team before the injuries talent was always going to be an issue. The part that pisses me off is the lack of structure and awareness this team shows. They go through stretches where they look like lost puppies just wondering around.
stlouisblues,lx7bgfc,2024-11-14 22:22:12,I’ll take blame for that one. I should have never turned down the titty.
stlouisblues,lx7cj2m,2024-11-14 22:28:30,All of this aside. Things have sucked without Panger and I think that's really where we're lacking. The Blues should bring him in for their in-house streaming service I'm SURE they're working on.
stlouisblues,lx7dfwp,2024-11-14 22:33:58,While we don’t have an amazing roster especially now with injuries what I’m seeing play out on the ice is more than just a bad roster. It’s a directionless team that makes careless mistakes and doesn’t appear to know where they or their teammates are supposed to be. A team that just stops playing hard inexplicably for long periods of time. The way they are losing strongly suggests to me it’s largely coaching both in a technical sense and in a motivational sense. 
stlouisblues,lx7eky6,2024-11-14 22:40:33,This team should not be concerned about scrounging up a point. Let's be real this is not a playoff roster and we shouldn't act like it is. What this team and organization SHOULD be concerned with is the NHL level development of our young talent. I would rather play smart complete competitive hockey and lose because of our roster than scrap a point with whatever the effort has been lately.
stlouisblues,lx7uzkh,2024-11-15 00:30:18,Blues will suck for another month or six weeks be in position to draft a young franchise D like Schaefer then Broberg and Thomas will help us make a late run (possibly aided by a Claude Julien new coach bump) and we will finish at 80ish points and the 11th overall pick. You know it’s going to happen just like this.
stlouisblues,lx7bpc5,2024-11-14 22:23:40,Please fire Bannister so we can at least get a new look. This team is fucking embarrassing even with all the injuries.
stlouisblues,lx7bja5,2024-11-14 22:22:40,What the fuck is Sunny doing there
stlouisblues,lx7cs97,2024-11-14 22:30:02,Hear me out.I want us to lose a bit. We need change. I want someone to catch shit for all these losses. I'm not a super detailed hockey fan but I am seeing the exact same issues over and over again. Generally boils down in my eyes to shitty defense not generating offense being too afraid to shoot and random ass puck fumbling.I don't know the solution. Firing Bannister? Maybe it's worth a try. We're without the talent but these seem largely like coaching issues to me.
stlouisblues,lx7cv2r,2024-11-14 22:30:29,At least if we’re going to lose we did it in overtime tonight unlike recent games.
stlouisblues,lx7qrlu,2024-11-14 23:58:44,33+ mins for SuterHahahahahaha “retool”
stlouisblues,lx7hkjt,2024-11-14 22:58:05,Bannister gotta go
stlouisblues,lx7bjcf,2024-11-14 22:22:41,https://preview.redd.it/eovkr8emhz0e1.jpeg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea3750f67a219f009c2cffb1c33c1d539dc27ccb
stlouisblues,lx7c1ym,2024-11-14 22:25:48,That could’ve been a win but whatever at this point.
stlouisblues,lx7ccvu,2024-11-14 22:27:29,Idk what to think.The team should play a bit better but this roster is ass.Most of these forwards are barely even third liner quality
stlouisblues,lx7tnwb,2024-11-15 00:20:10,Dude Bannister sucks why did we extend him?
stlouisblues,lx7f9wb,2024-11-14 22:44:33,Fuck my life
stlouisblues,lx7bi3s,2024-11-14 22:22:28,Why can't this team lose in normal fashion? A 8-1 loss followed by two blown leads hurts
stlouisblues,lx7bx7o,2024-11-14 22:25:01,I had started to reply to a comment about delayed penalties but realized the post game was up. Someone said they were new to hockey and wondering why they exist.    Lets say there's a battle on the boards and the puck squirts out as some would say and Team A trips Team B to prevent a breakaway....but the tripped player still manages to push the puck along and his buddies go on to take advantage of said breakaway and score. An immediate penalty would have prevented that.Hockey is very much a game of chance luck and momentum. I entirely understand the delayed penalty rule based on these things. Sometimes it may be your only chance and having a penalty \*in your favor\* could end up being detrimental.
stlouisblues,lx7q5cf,2024-11-14 23:54:19,Whelp I called the Schenner points streak. But it’s led to losses. 3 points in 2 games. I guess it’s just back to back a streak would be 3.
stlouisblues,lx7bevx,2024-11-14 22:21:58,Tank for Bedard!
stlouisblues,lx7bfsc,2024-11-14 22:22:06,James Hagens… If you can hear us please save us (/s… maybe)
stlouisblues,lx7hfm1,2024-11-14 22:57:16,Better than 0 points? I guess?
stlouisblues,lx7biw6,2024-11-14 22:22:36,"I really hope ""almost"" doesn't become the defining word of Kyrou's career."
stlouisblues,lx7c3fj,2024-11-14 22:26:01,Bannister 
stlouisblues,lx7d0t4,2024-11-14 22:31:26,The Florida Everblades aren't beating this team but I think they'd make 'em sweat.
stlouisblues,lx7d78y,2024-11-14 22:32:30,I love this team but maybe emotionally it's a basketball year.
stlouisblues,lx7i8pu,2024-11-14 23:02:07,Hope the Blues get tired of losing and bring their A game for the rest of the season;  we’ve seen them at their best and the talent is there…it’s just not there every night. Big question is why??? Like last year with Kyrou and he was surrounded by negativity…he comes out the following night and has the best game of his life shutting down the critics.  He was definitely on a mission to do that.  However how come he doesn’t do that every night??? Is it that exhausting to play like that every night?  Only he knows that answer but I sure like watching him play when he’s focused and in that zone.  I also love when Colt 55 is firing bombs into the back of the net from the slot…he’s definitely in the zone.  Bottomline this team needs to find a way to get in that frame of mind every single game.  IMO that’s what they are lacking…locked in and focused.
stlouisblues,lx7bymr,2024-11-14 22:25:16,They really keep finding new ways to lose as frustratingly as possible. 
stlouisblues,lx7bjr7,2024-11-14 22:22:45,We can’t even beat the Sabres when they’re without their #1 goalie and best forward? WOOF!
stlouisblues,lx7ben9,2024-11-14 22:21:56,Oof
stlouisblues,lx7bkfq,2024-11-14 22:22:53,Anyone want to guess which of [these two pairings](https://i.imgur.com/sBmhEDX.png) Bannister decided to narrow down to for closing out the game? Dude can't get fired soon enough.
stlouisblues,lx7bry8,2024-11-14 22:24:08,Sabres team would destroy us full strength lmao
stlouisblues,lx7bnqw,2024-11-14 22:23:25,That was fucking lame
stlouisblues,lx7bhta,2024-11-14 22:22:25,Brb gonna drown my sorrows in Carín León
stlouisblues,lx7cv66,2024-11-14 22:30:30,so basically ownership wont let the team tank because they're greedy right? i feel like that's the gist of it
stlouisblues,lx7hpei,2024-11-14 22:58:52,Same issue Berube had at the end.
stlouisblues,lx85645,2024-11-15 01:55:25,I was so ready to let him cook at the beginning of the year...
stlouisblues,lx7cehm,2024-11-14 22:27:45,This one left me scratching my head too. I want to have an outburst of wtf but I don't know....
stlouisblues,lx7c00n,2024-11-14 22:25:30,Mainly to just secure a point lol. It’s not a must win game nor is it a division rival. These are the games we can technically afford to lose.  Having said that. This team is completely different without Broberg and Thomas. 
stlouisblues,lx7btt6,2024-11-14 22:24:27,Because Bannister is a coward.
stlouisblues,lx7tp1f,2024-11-15 00:20:25,We have to pray he signs here.
stlouisblues,lx7d28i,2024-11-14 22:31:41,Because we had Thomas and Broberg for a majority of those wins lmao
stlouisblues,lx7hesq,2024-11-14 22:57:08,Thomas and Broberg carried
stlouisblues,lx7bued,2024-11-14 22:24:33,We have Claude Julien behind the bench. Just let him take over.
stlouisblues,lx7c0xz,2024-11-14 22:25:39,I hope you've learned a lesson young man!
stlouisblues,lx7dfop,2024-11-14 22:33:55,From those of us who wish we had a titty available to us never turn one down.
stlouisblues,lx7e4d6,2024-11-14 22:37:49,I miss him so much. He has zero chemistry with the other guy in Chi
stlouisblues,lx7u7xq,2024-11-15 00:24:25,Miss him more than any player we lost & I fucking miss ROR DP57 & Vladi
stlouisblues,lx7ix8t,2024-11-14 23:06:21,But but but we have to play Kap instead of Bolduc! And we have to overwork Suter on the top pairing! It's super important says the coach!
stlouisblues,lx7izsq,2024-11-14 23:06:47,That’s what’s so frustrating. This team had about a 25% chance of making the playoffs coming into the year. At least let Bolduc and the young guys play and develop. Starting to tick me off watching these older 1 year contract patch work guys get all the minutes especially late in games
stlouisblues,lx80r8e,2024-11-15 01:17:04,Then keep bannister as coach. Wtf do you people want? Everyone in the sub is about as directionless as the team.1. Everyone says fire him. (Which what you’re saying could bump up Julien and we could go on a similar run as last season).2. People say tank and rebuild. Sure. But the rebuilding part would force us to get rid of our core guys. Pick a fucking direction and stick with it. Seriously if you want a franchise altering player without a rebuild you would have to keep bannister (so far). Because what he’s doing right now is a fantastic example of someone who isn’t tanking on purpose but because he doesn’t have an idea how to adjust this team.
stlouisblues,lx7d0yh,2024-11-14 22:31:27,Let the season play out with bannister. Worst that can happen is growing pains of a younger group and a top 10 maybe top 5 pick lol. 
stlouisblues,lx9etun,2024-11-15 08:34:46,I’m not necessarily saying I disagree. I just don’t see what choice could be made that would make things better. I think Bannister is probably developing the young team about as well as anybody else would. I think we just have a team that isn’t super good that also doesn’t have a strong enough system/depth chart holes are where injuries are - C Lhd - to overcome not being super good.
stlouisblues,lx7c59f,2024-11-14 22:26:18,Plus it’s hilarious when the team about to go on the PP puts it in their own net
stlouisblues,lx7bgrj,2024-11-14 22:22:15,Lose for Hughes!
stlouisblues,lx7ctb2,2024-11-14 22:30:12,![gif](giphy|rTLjwB6zOxV9S)
stlouisblues,lx7bp61,2024-11-14 22:23:38,If we keep the injuries coming we have a legit shot sad as that is.
stlouisblues,lxb29ds,2024-11-15 13:41:16,True anything is better than 0 but I'd like 2 next time lol
stlouisblues,lx7chuy,2024-11-14 22:28:18,He does “almost” an awfully lot doesn’t he.
stlouisblues,lx7c39h,2024-11-14 22:26:00,Guy is what he is at this point. Need to give up hope he ever becomes the elite scorer we wanted him to be. Still a good player but not elite.
stlouisblues,lxch64f,2024-11-15 18:05:53,Tru dat sir
stlouisblues,lx7c662,2024-11-14 22:26:27,We are without our best forward and second best Dman.
stlouisblues,lx7butn,2024-11-14 22:24:37,I mean we're down our best forward and defender.
stlouisblues,lx7d3ga,2024-11-14 22:31:53,Where did you find those stats??
stlouisblues,lx813j0,2024-11-15 01:19:58,I don’t know what you’re trying to say here. That Faulk Kessel pair if you’re trying to close out a 1 goal game per your stats is what you want. 0.092 xG against. Sure not the offensive fire power of the other pairing but that per your stats is the better d pair. Anyways perunovich had a eh game kessel was decent and Faulk fucked up on goal three. Fucking Ryan Suter is the biggest issue.
stlouisblues,lx7bwmg,2024-11-14 22:24:55,They would?
stlouisblues,lx7dbjq,2024-11-14 22:33:14,The amount of people who don’t realize why tanking is bad for a franchise is beyond me. This isn’t EA NHL 25.
stlouisblues,lx7ei9y,2024-11-14 22:40:06,They're very wealthy but not infinitely so. The team has an operating budget an internal salary cap etc. A monster tank with sub 10k a night attendance probably won't work with those numbers.But punting on this year isn't a tank and I don't think it's the worst idea. We still have thomas/kyrou/broberg to build around and parayko and binner as vet leaders moving forward. Sell saad and all the mid guys as rentals and hope we get a #2 center out of dvorsky or our 1st this year
stlouisblues,lx7dez8,2024-11-14 22:33:49,They scored with :30 seconds left of 4 on 3.The penalty occurred with about :59 seconds to go. You go after it get a stick on it at with 30+ seconds left and that goal never happens. Knock out a short 4 on 5 (less open ice) and then take your chances in OT.Not sure if that was poor effort or poor coaching but looked like a touch of both.
stlouisblues,lx7tsxe,2024-11-15 00:21:13,Huh? Every point in the NHL counts the same no matter the month or opponent 
stlouisblues,lx87qux,2024-11-15 02:18:55,I realy don't understand the fretting sorry.
stlouisblues,lx7cn6i,2024-11-14 22:29:12,Maybe claude has been planning a coup this whole time
stlouisblues,lx8i2f2,2024-11-15 03:58:58,There are just a lot of different opinions which is good. Reddit is at its worst when it’s all hive mind garbage.For me — keep Bannister start trading players and stockpiling picks and prospects let Steen choose his guy as coach after the season ends. Fairly straightforward.
stlouisblues,lxbb2l4,2024-11-15 14:25:02,I mean you’re surprised the fan base is of two different mindsets? Unless teams are winning consistently people want change. However I agree. But Bannister’s late game decision to not press in the last minute to give Buffalo a 4 on 3 PP in OT was dumb. Go all out for the puck. They had a minute they just killed and scored at 1:33 into OT. If they pressed harder would they have gotten that penalty killed? Who knows but there was like 20-30 seconds of inaction that ultimately killed the Blues chance to get the two points. And yeah it’s not a division game but every point matters. We had two then only got one on the road. That can make a difference for playoff contention and Bannister needs to enforce that within the game and be quick.
stlouisblues,lx7d9rf,2024-11-14 22:32:56,I think I am indifferent. I think our season is going to struggle regardless (injuries takes time to learn new coaching styles etc). I wouldn't mind if we kept him or fired him maybe a slight preference for firing him only because I am purely curious to see if a change in coaching does anything.
stlouisblues,lx7dh8e,2024-11-14 22:34:10,Worse than continuing to develop bad habits with the young talent?
stlouisblues,lx7j3sb,2024-11-14 23:07:29,What growing pains? He refuses to get with the program and play the young guys.
stlouisblues,lx9wo8x,2024-11-15 10:14:47,Not real sure about his development of young guys as he sits Bolduc in favor of Kappy. This is a lost season why not let the kids play learn and give them the chance to develop?
stlouisblues,lx7ujh0,2024-11-15 00:26:52,[Boy are you gonna love this video](https://youtu.be/v2EgcBJG9uE?si=BHd9SzfVEzknGl9x)
stlouisblues,lx7crq3,2024-11-14 22:29:57,I'd take it tbh it's not like these games are fun to watch anyways let's get a real star center on this team besides Thomas and have a bounce back year with all or promising prospects. Just my opinion though I know a lot of Blues fans don't want a tank season.
stlouisblues,lx81608,2024-11-15 01:20:35,The new Jaden Schwartz
stlouisblues,lx7e6zj,2024-11-14 22:38:14,Oh no he might *only* be a 30-40 goal scorer!!!
stlouisblues,lx7dtr3,2024-11-14 22:36:06,These are from moneypuck.com. Their xG numbers can be questionable at times but they work for this kind of thing.
stlouisblues,lx7bzz1,2024-11-14 22:25:30,The Springfield Thunderbirds would destroy us full strength
stlouisblues,lx7tfp9,2024-11-15 00:18:23,If tanking is so bad for a franchise why were Chicago San Jose etc. so eager to do it? 
stlouisblues,lxb5wwm,2024-11-15 13:59:15,Vegas is the only cup winner since the Boston Bruins that hasn't gone through a full rebuild via the draft to build their teams.
stlouisblues,lx7kxoz,2024-11-14 23:19:08,"So what's the explanation for refusing to do an actual rebuild then? Look at what new york did in 2018 literally told the fans ""we're intentionally tanking it's gonna be a few years till we're good again sorry"" now they've been a legit cup contender for the past three years. Also why is it bad for the franchise other than poor fan attendance/money? That's exactly what I'm getting at."
stlouisblues,lx7lji7,2024-11-14 23:23:02,it's just that we now know this isn't gonna be a playoff team so why don't we have more ahl guys in the lineup? maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way with how bad we've looked the past couple weeks maybe this is just the tank already.
stlouisblues,lx7v6k5,2024-11-15 00:31:50,Yeah with the way they’re playing this year we’d touch the puck and they’d score off the faceoff in our zone with 30 seconds left & we’d never get to OT lol.
stlouisblues,lx7zm3t,2024-11-15 01:07:26,Sure every point counts. Which I mean we got a point at the very least. Second it’s not a western conference team that would be competing with us for a wildcard spot in the west. So no technically this isn’t a must win game if we still want to make the playoffs. 
stlouisblues,lx7cxry,2024-11-14 22:30:55,Coup Julien
stlouisblues,lxd1fhb,2024-11-15 20:10:12,Yes. Let the season play out for better or worse. If you want a top 5 pick then so far keeping bannister is going to be the key without trading away core players.
stlouisblues,lx7dodh,2024-11-14 22:35:16,I’m in the boat where this isn’t a make or break season given all the young guys we have. Bannister so far is clearly not a long term guy so I’m curious to see a full season under him mainly so guys like army and steen can see what the biggest issues we have (which ones stay consistent thru the entire season) and then find a coach that fix that. At the same time though we cannot fall into a losing culture. 
stlouisblues,lx7e34y,2024-11-14 22:37:38,Habits can be corrected. Most of these guys are not in their primes right now. But then again most of the guys making the same mistakes have been here for a bit. So..
stlouisblues,lx807iz,2024-11-15 01:12:25,I agree he needs to play bolduc more than kap. But idk what you’re only focused on bolduc when we have handful of the guys in our lineup who are young. 
stlouisblues,lx7dw2e,2024-11-14 22:36:29,I mean it won't be a full intentional tank. Thomas/parayko/binnington and the other young guys aren't going anywhere.But if parayko faulk or binnington go down we are headed for a bottom-10 finish assuredly maybe even bottom 5. Add Hagens or Misa or Frondell and suddenly we look like a fucking wagon in a few years.
stlouisblues,lx7fnb0,2024-11-14 22:46:45,Yeah this team has been miserable to watch since Thomas and Broberg went down. Unless they come back and this team becomes a comeback wagon I’d like to see them sell and commit to a “development year” for 1 more year. We have a lot of good prospects in the system but no blue chip superstar. And our division is really competitive this year. Mild Avs Stars Jets all look really good. I still wouldn’t count out Nashville. They’ve been ass but they have too much star power to be bottom of the division
stlouisblues,lx8cqw9,2024-11-15 03:05:57,Leading goal scorer in our cup run (including 2 hat tricks) while playing great defensively throughout his entire career with us?
stlouisblues,lx7jipa,2024-11-14 23:10:07,Yeah picking on Kyrou is just weird. There's about a dozen larger issues. For instance that was the first game this season Schenn actually showed up.
stlouisblues,lx7ue80,2024-11-15 00:25:47,40 is pushing it. He’s only broken 32 once 
stlouisblues,lx7vgun,2024-11-15 00:34:03,Whaaaaaat you mean we didn’t get the second coming of Connor McDavid with a random 35th overall pick?? /s
stlouisblues,lx949dn,2024-11-15 07:24:50,And those teams still have years to go. Fact is that they are missing their best forward and best D man not to mention another 2nd pairing D man. No reason to completely tank. Rebuilding a roster is tough but rebuilding a competitive culture in an organization is even harder.
stlouisblues,lx7zqhv,2024-11-15 01:08:27,They had no other choice to. They had aging cores. I like how you picked the two teams exclusively that needed to rebuild lol. 
stlouisblues,lxd1aeg,2024-11-15 20:09:19,Vegas is a special case because they treat free agency and trades as if it was a video game lol.
stlouisblues,lx7rwd4,2024-11-15 00:06:58,The rangers rebuild would have gone a lot different if Panarin wasn't dead set on playing there. Plus you had Fox basically demand a trade to them. Also they already had Shesterkin in their system. They are by far the exception.
stlouisblues,lx7tivo,2024-11-15 00:19:04,It’s not. Star players win Cups. Go and try to find the last team that won a championship without a top five draft pick on the roster. 
stlouisblues,lx7oh03,2024-11-14 23:42:39,I mean we're losing plenty right now to develop a losing culture especially with how we're losing
stlouisblues,lx86y0s,2024-11-15 02:11:32,I'm not only focused on Bolduc and he's not the sole example but he is a glaring mind-boggling example. The guy's an A prospect who's shown he can produce with a top 6 center and he still plays well when he doesn't have one. It's quite strange especially when we're hurting for offe se..
stlouisblues,lx7jvsh,2024-11-14 23:12:23,It's odd you don't mention Schaefer. He's the soaring need here.
stlouisblues,lx97s0k,2024-11-15 07:49:38,He has been decent defensively but just the “almost” title with Schwartz seems fitting. Dude would miss wide open nets hit posts etc
stlouisblues,lx99i04,2024-11-15 08:00:59,Is that a number between 30 and 40? My math is rusty
stlouisblues,lx7tz7y,2024-11-15 00:22:33,& they got lucky and picked 1st overall and 2nd overall back to back years. Even tanking it’s hard to get those picks back to back. It’s not like you tank and just get the first overall guaranteed.
stlouisblues,lx7zyak,2024-11-15 01:10:15,Yeah but I’m sure things would be much much worse mentally if we just said “fuck it”. If the front office just straight up gave up on the team that would make players not want to play here. Which would put us in a such a shitty culture. (Looking at Buffalo). 
stlouisblues,lx9b72b,2024-11-15 08:12:00,I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. I wish every forward we drafted was Jaden Schwartz. His tenacity in board battles combined with his ability to steal pucks and contribute offensively on the first line was huge for us
stlouisblues,lx9cq74,2024-11-15 08:21:45,O I loved Schwartz as well but he had some years where he was absolutely snake bitten. Still decent points but it felt like he couldn’t buy a goal. Like he could’ve had maybe 10-15 more goals he just didn’t hit the net hit a post goalie made an excellent save. This is not Schwartz slander.
stlouisblues,lx72p96,2024-11-14 21:31:26,Who needs defense? Let's just have 4 forwards and 1 defensemen. They can swap between Parayko and Faulk every 5 minutes. ggezpz

stlouisblues,lx3wws3,2024-11-14 11:32:30,Neat. Would love to see those 1st round guys become impact players soon! Hopefully we see some of the mid-late round guys ascend as well. That’s the key to having organizational depth. Can’t only rely on first round picks showing up.
stlouisblues,lx488zx,2024-11-14 12:30:27,Ooof this organization’s future would be looking rough if not for those offer sheets. We desperately needed to tank last year to grab a better bet on defense. I will say there are lots of good depth pieces here so maybe we can use future high picks to get the impact talent to plug the major holes.
stlouisblues,lx58w24,2024-11-14 15:36:48,Someone tell me is this good or bad relative to the average team?
stlouisblues,lx3vzx6,2024-11-14 11:27:48,If it gets pinned and everything so that everyone can see it. Yes.
stlouisblues,lx4qcjr,2024-11-14 14:01:43,Huh? Everyone except the douchebags at The Athletic has our prospect pool in the top 10.
stlouisblues,lxg18ee,2024-11-16 10:40:11,There really isn't a single elite prospect in the blues system which really drags down the overall upside of the system. However it's a pretty deep pool with a good amount of potential NHLers in it (unfortunately a lot of 3rd-4th liners and 2nd-3rd pair d). A lot of writers have the blues prospect pool in the upper half of the league but not top ten. 
stlouisblues,lx549tp,2024-11-14 15:13:00,Who is everyone
stlouisblues,lx6txaa,2024-11-14 20:42:08,Why be upset at someone making rankings? Especially Pronman who takes his job very seriously. Jesus man some of you are as soft as shit.
stlouisblues,lx707cp,2024-11-14 21:17:02,From what I can tell after looking at about 8 random sites the average ranking of the system is maybe around 12. Not near unanimously top 10.I’ll repeat that I said *if* we didn’t add Broberg and Holloway the future would be looking rough. The defensive depth would be so bad. Broberg has potentially filled a massive hole. This retooling strategy where we maybe contend for the playoffs don’t make it and then only have the #12ish farm system is a recipe for an eternity as a middle of the pack team. It’s not 2005 rough but it’s not fun.We needed to tank last year to get a better bet on D. We need to tank this year. We have to accumulate more high end prospect depth. Not more Jiriceks and Bolducs. One man’s opinion.

stlouisblues,lx562v2,2024-11-14 15:22:18,"Everyone else who ranks these things from THW to TSN and everything in between. Pundits sites YT channels everyone. Meanwhile Pronman recently left Neighbours completely out of his ""top 150""-ish NHL players and prospects under 23. The guy who scored 27 in his first full season. They've also plummeted Dvorsky and Snuggerud from their own previous rankings while most everyone else has them both in their top 25-30-35. The Athletic has turned into a Leafs fan boy blog of people who only watch hockey from Dom's model. Dom the guy who still insists Parayko ""plays a bruising physical style that won't age well"". Which is strange because I know he watches Leafs games and Matthews hasn't scored an even strength goal with Parayko on the ice in eight games. That whole hockey staff is a mess with a few stray exceptions."
stlouisblues,lx6u8pq,2024-11-14 20:43:51,I'm not angry at their rankings. I find their individual scouting to be lazy. But again that wasn't the point. The point was most places have them rated pretty high. Even Pronman only has them like 14th.
stlouisblues,lx715sd,2024-11-14 21:22:33,Broberg has aged out he's not included in these rankings. We're not one Holloway away from having a weak prospect pool. Jiricek and Bolduc are A prospects man.
stlouisblues,lx57jeq,2024-11-14 15:29:49,Complaining about people who rank our team's prospects lower than you want is not everyone ranking the Blues in top 10. I have yet to see an unbiased source rank the Blues prospects top 10 so if you have them please share.
stlouisblues,lx74ieb,2024-11-14 21:41:49,My original comment that you responded to was about the “organization’s future” and was in response to the OP’s picture which is a collection of age 24 and under players that included Broberg and Holloway. Without them the picture would be looking much less exciting.Also Jiricek and Bolduc are not grade A prospects. How many grades above A do you have? A+ A++ A+++?
stlouisblues,lx59tdm,2024-11-14 15:41:32,That wasn't actually the point of my comment the point was we have a pretty good prospect pool. We had more players than any other team at the U20s last year and they all ate like pigs.But sure. Pardon me on my memory I see some I thought were top 10 actually have us 11th or 12th. Even so we have a lot of quality hockey players in the pipeline with one area that still needs a top pairing ace or (gasp!) two. We're kinda loaded everywhere else.[https://eprinkside.com/2024/08/31/ep-rinkside-2024-nhl-prospect-pool-rankings-no-11-ranked-st-louis-blues](https://eprinkside.com/2024/08/31/ep-rinkside-2024-nhl-prospect-pool-rankings-no-11-ranked-st-louis-blues)[https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/news/ranking-every-nhl-teams-2024-25-prospect-pool-from-1-32](https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/news/ranking-every-nhl-teams-2024-25-prospect-pool-from-1-32)[https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/story/\_/id/41791604/nhl-ranking-prospects-teams-2025-top-players-future-sharks](https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/41791604/nhl-ranking-prospects-teams-2025-top-players-future-sharks)I cannot find this guy's overall rankings but IIRC we were #9.[https://www.si.com/onsi/breakaway/prospects-feed/posts/st-louis-blues-most-underrated-prospect-system-nhl](https://www.si.com/onsi/breakaway/prospects-feed/posts/st-louis-blues-most-underrated-prospect-system-nhl)[https://www.instagram.com/nhl.discussion/p/C\_zbl4nMa9v/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/nhl.discussion/p/C_zbl4nMa9v/?hl=en)You get the idea top 10-12 usually.

goldenknights,lxtz0dg,2024-11-18 17:34:40,Nope.
goldenknights,lxtqgzz,2024-11-18 16:49:44,bro they lost bc LT was on one last night. they played well except for the blue line turn overs and being unable to clear the d zone. exactly how we always lose when we do.blaming the most dynamic player and 3 highest scoring player in the NHL is a dumb take. sorry
goldenknights,lxtb9l3,2024-11-18 15:33:11,No. The spin moves and back passes are fantastic. VGK lost because LT simply wouldn't allow pucks in the goal. 
goldenknights,lxtrcff,2024-11-18 16:54:09,Eichel tried to set up Doro many times
goldenknights,lxtfbka,2024-11-18 15:53:32,I didn't get to watch because of it being on NHL Network. Are you talking in general or just PP? Sometimes I feel Jack tries to do it all himself sometimes and that's not the best mindset
goldenknights,lxu3ew8,2024-11-18 17:58:40,Lost cause traded wrong goalie.
goldenknights,lxtrd8e,2024-11-18 16:54:16,LT was excellent. They also played real sloppy. Both are true.
goldenknights,lxtdgn3,2024-11-18 15:44:15,The spin moves resulted in the player landing on their face 100% of the time last night. I was counting. Everyone in our section was making fun of it. They were not fantastic. C button occasionally fellas not 100% of the time. It’s like salt a little can go a long way.
goldenknights,lxu4qpq,2024-11-18 18:06:11,That’s true successfully 1.5 times but attempted more. Agreed.

goldenknights,lxp8xax,2024-11-17 22:23:06,We are so getting a goal in a second
goldenknights,lxpcix1,2024-11-17 22:47:17,Oh no u/sneakytinkerspirits the dreaded number returns
goldenknights,lxpcgw1,2024-11-17 22:46:53,welp hats off to Ovi. Can't wait to see the Caps make another early playoff exit
goldenknights,lxp3fg6,2024-11-17 21:47:48,Goalies need to bail you out time to time Sammy just can’t
goldenknights,lxpc391,2024-11-17 22:44:17,I think LT is completing his revenge tour on us sadly
goldenknights,lxpcfbj,2024-11-17 22:46:35,LT was good Samsonov was not
goldenknights,lxopznx,2024-11-17 20:24:51,Big PP time
goldenknights,lxoqm6r,2024-11-17 20:28:40,Nice power play man!
goldenknights,lxoqssh,2024-11-17 20:29:49,I just gotta say I love shit talking with this group. 
goldenknights,lxoqwjb,2024-11-17 20:30:27,Bros just staying laying on the ice to block the lane 
goldenknights,lxor2q3,2024-11-17 20:31:30,Too much passing right there
goldenknights,lxorkxd,2024-11-17 20:34:36,Jeez
goldenknights,lxos7fx,2024-11-17 20:38:25,Man I hate Tom Wilson and PLD
goldenknights,lxotzqx,2024-11-17 20:49:27,There we go got something going at the end let’s carry that the rest of the game
goldenknights,lxox3zt,2024-11-17 21:08:39,The injuries are starting man  Hope Hutton gets better soon
goldenknights,lxoxki6,2024-11-17 21:11:31,WTF!? Damn dude.
goldenknights,lxoxxdo,2024-11-17 21:13:45,Jesus fucking Christ. wtf
goldenknights,lxoye8n,2024-11-17 21:16:36,Yk what annoys me about when we play the caps even last yr we dont even get beat by ovi
goldenknights,lxp2ivg,2024-11-17 21:42:16,bro wtf
goldenknights,lxp2kb8,2024-11-17 21:42:30,FUCK!
goldenknights,lxp2o66,2024-11-17 21:43:10,Motherfucker man
goldenknights,lxp2qka,2024-11-17 21:43:34,I just sounded like Cleveland watching that develop….“NO NO NO NO NO”
goldenknights,lxp9sii,2024-11-17 22:28:48,Gotta leave for work so good luck with the rest of the game
goldenknights,lxpcpww,2024-11-17 22:48:36,I get that it's a Sunday and F1 is making it a pain in the ass to get around the strip but everyone it's less than a minute just keep your butts seated.
goldenknights,lxppff7,2024-11-18 00:22:26,NGL watching LT cry through his welcome back video was tough. One of the good guys.
goldenknights,lxorp6h,2024-11-17 20:35:20,Why are we always so easy to score on? Just throw pucks at our net and they are going in.
goldenknights,lxpd76r,2024-11-17 22:51:54,Anyone have anything to say about Sammy? Or do you just like to hate on Hill?
goldenknights,lxpcfds,2024-11-17 22:46:36,Ovi hat trick is cool to see but like not cool against us.
goldenknights,lxo2c6g,2024-11-17 18:05:44,Korczak being listed daily as a Forward is the future I didn’t know I wanted and I certainly didn’t deserve. I imagine his future convo with O Coach goes something like Kramer’s “but I don’t even work here.” “That’s what makes this so difficult.”
goldenknights,lxp2o0a,2024-11-17 21:43:08,Can this team get an above average goalie please?
goldenknights,lxpawrp,2024-11-17 22:36:19,I don’t think we have 3 goals in us especially with LT playing lights out and posts hating us.
goldenknights,lxpdvts,2024-11-17 22:56:38,Shit performance.
goldenknights,lxoqgxi,2024-11-17 20:27:48,Imagine having a Captain that actually stays in the ice with us for large chunks of the season…
goldenknights,lxor2hr,2024-11-17 20:31:27,Atleast we generated some momentum. Hope that’s enough to get us moving
goldenknights,lxorh3s,2024-11-17 20:33:57,Lol team just doesn’t care
goldenknights,lxosc1p,2024-11-17 20:39:13,[deleted]
goldenknights,lxoux0m,2024-11-17 20:55:05,Let's drop 6 on em and call it a touchdown.
goldenknights,lxoxj96,2024-11-17 21:11:18,Knights plz this does not induce joy. :(
goldenknights,lxoxjfx,2024-11-17 21:11:20,And defense is asleep….
goldenknights,lxoxk29,2024-11-17 21:11:26,This defense isnt it to many open shots.
goldenknights,lxoxkt9,2024-11-17 21:11:34,Fuck man
goldenknights,lxp2n6n,2024-11-17 21:42:59,:T
goldenknights,lxp5h3k,2024-11-17 22:00:42,They are really pushing tablo all of a sudden
goldenknights,lxpa4qq,2024-11-17 22:31:04,OW
goldenknights,lxpc9ft,2024-11-17 22:45:28,While we did get goalied the slow start also destroyed us.
goldenknights,lxorp4f,2024-11-17 20:35:20,Samsnov just sucks he’s not mentally there
goldenknights,lxp18oz,2024-11-17 21:34:21,I'll admit it. I was not impressed with Hanifin when he first join last year but he is playing really well right now and I am very glad he is with us
goldenknights,lxpcqrh,2024-11-17 22:48:46,We let that fucking Putin sympathizer get a hat trick on us 
goldenknights,lxp5mi0,2024-11-17 22:01:40,I don't trust Samsonov at all he sucks ass
goldenknights,lxorqn1,2024-11-17 20:35:35,This isnt a fun sunday for me football and hockey
goldenknights,lxoxkwv,2024-11-17 21:11:35,Sammy is trash
goldenknights,lxpcev1,2024-11-17 22:46:30,Well fuck me running
goldenknights,lxohgvx,2024-11-17 19:33:31,Wish I could watch. Hopefully the boys pull through. Stupid how NHL network isn’t on YouTube tv
goldenknights,lxop6pb,2024-11-17 20:19:55,They got that to easy
goldenknights,lxopbqr,2024-11-17 20:20:47,When was the last time we led a game at the start? Been a few?
goldenknights,lxoq6x7,2024-11-17 20:26:06,Anyone notice this bullshit Circa Sports commercial show dude betting $20k on his phone?
goldenknights,lxormxx,2024-11-17 20:34:57,Yeah that’s not great. He wasn’t screened
goldenknights,lxorooe,2024-11-17 20:35:15,I am not enjoying this.
goldenknights,lxorpdu,2024-11-17 20:35:22,Jesus fucking Christ
goldenknights,lxorsig,2024-11-17 20:35:54,Cool
goldenknights,lxotmjo,2024-11-17 20:47:11,Just tuning in... so this kind of game again eh?
goldenknights,lxoulp7,2024-11-17 20:53:09,Seems like teams are starting to gameplan how to prevent our breakouts and it’s causing all kinds of issues when we don’t adjust.
goldenknights,lxozzb9,2024-11-17 21:26:25,Yo how rich is the lawyer that sponsors on all the Knights stuff. He has to have a huge law firm in Vegas
goldenknights,lxp29ti,2024-11-17 21:40:42,Would really like to get out of here with the equalizer
goldenknights,lxp2lwq,2024-11-17 21:42:46,Wtf ovi has two goals against us did he even score on us last yr
goldenknights,lxp2gzy,2024-11-17 21:41:56,Fucking cmon. What a frustrating game. Tilt the ice the whole period for this shit?
goldenknights,lxp2mzi,2024-11-17 21:42:57,And now the missed call Jfc
goldenknights,lxpcdjo,2024-11-17 22:46:15,Of course
goldenknights,lxp2l62,2024-11-17 21:42:39,Classic Samsonov
goldenknights,lxpat1s,2024-11-17 22:35:38,Thompson trying to prove to Vegas the big mistake they made by trading him
goldenknights,lxp2ij9,2024-11-17 21:42:12,Ya fk samsonov
goldenknights,lxopq0x,2024-11-17 20:23:12,Fanning on the shot cmon
goldenknights,lxp5xyx,2024-11-17 22:03:43,Everybody has been talking about turnovers but Caps have been turning it over a lot too the difference is they don't have a slice of Swiss cheese in net
goldenknights,lxouus2,2024-11-17 20:54:42,Same 
goldenknights,lxoyy1c,2024-11-17 21:20:02,WHAT A REALLY WEIRD SENTENCE.
goldenknights,lxoqyjq,2024-11-17 20:30:47,Hi best friend <3
goldenknights,lxosfyg,2024-11-17 20:39:54,I want not just one but TWO trash can kicks.![gif](giphy|vNNsw7IsdQfowDotga)
goldenknights,lxoslnr,2024-11-17 20:40:53,Someone PLEASE put a mic on Bruce... I want to hear him rip them apart.
goldenknights,lxosz2a,2024-11-17 20:43:10,DIG THE FUCK IN RIGHT FUCKING NOW
goldenknights,lxoscky,2024-11-17 20:39:19,Im not blaming a goalie coming back from injury the play has to be better in front of him even during the wins hill robbed alot of games the play in front of him wasnt good either
goldenknights,lxosspt,2024-11-17 20:42:05,Hi also from central time!! Unless you meant you’re in Connecticut in which case I def am NOT 
goldenknights,lxou0wg,2024-11-17 20:49:40,Big if true
goldenknights,lxozpih,2024-11-17 21:24:44,Yeah he knows his team is good enough team to make noise in the playoffs so hes commited more to win instead of just going for gretz record
goldenknights,lxp837b,2024-11-17 22:17:36,One of the gambles of all time
goldenknights,lxoq85r,2024-11-17 20:26:19,Not string cheese tho because your country sucks
goldenknights,lxoskkd,2024-11-17 20:40:42,I do love the stats you find.
goldenknights,lxosnaz,2024-11-17 20:41:09,You brain is impeccable 
goldenknights,lxowovr,2024-11-17 21:06:03,But 0.500 is a ratio - where do we rank on volume of games we trail in the 2nd? All that stat shows is on the occasion that we do need to come back we are better than most. (I know I'm being pedantic lol :P)
goldenknights,lxojle1,2024-11-17 19:46:04,Korzack playing?
goldenknights,lxotdpj,2024-11-17 20:45:40,Yeah 1st periods are a problem now.
goldenknights,lxotbz9,2024-11-17 20:45:22,5 shots… and most of them from the PP.
goldenknights,lxotwdi,2024-11-17 20:48:53,Guess we just needed a 6th shot lol
goldenknights,lxoz8pf,2024-11-17 21:21:53,You aren’t allowed to leave now. That’s the rules.
goldenknights,lxoz2gc,2024-11-17 21:20:47,You called it !!!
goldenknights,lxoyz2r,2024-11-17 21:20:13,Retweet
goldenknights,lxp77ax,2024-11-17 22:11:50,PING!
goldenknights,lxont1e,2024-11-17 20:11:31,On hockey tv
goldenknights,lxoxzye,2024-11-17 21:14:12,Yeah idek if we have one hill has been on fire lately idk if thats gonna be sustainable
goldenknights,lxp2qp8,2024-11-17 21:43:35,Rather have Samsonov take the shot and not the passing play.
goldenknights,lxp51kc,2024-11-17 21:57:57,Another cheeky 3 goal effort in the final 10 minutes coming for sure
goldenknights,lxonesu,2024-11-17 20:09:05,Is... is that good????
goldenknights,lxos3jt,2024-11-17 20:37:46,Goaltending + defensive turnover combo will kill this team
goldenknights,lxosidl,2024-11-17 20:40:20,Its mainly the tos for me those correleate tge bad goaltending for me
goldenknights,lxowh2x,2024-11-17 21:04:43,I definitely suspect there’s something cooking but I have no idea what it might be
goldenknights,lxoyzu0,2024-11-17 21:20:21,CALLED IT
goldenknights,lxp36si,2024-11-17 21:46:20,"""Too fucking many"" with a plus or minus variable of ""wtf"""
goldenknights,lxp331p,2024-11-17 21:45:42,To fucking many feel its atleast half this yr of the goals we given up
goldenknights,lxox9mj,2024-11-17 21:09:38,We do not need another season of health issues.
goldenknights,lxpt3jp,2024-11-18 00:54:19,I hate it but maybe it’s the turn around we need
goldenknights,lxos125,2024-11-17 20:37:21,We dont deny shots like our cup yr teams only shots were to right or left mainly now we ate up middle of our dzone
goldenknights,lxpdlq0,2024-11-17 22:54:43,The difference is that people aren’t dick riding Sammy when he sucks like they do Hill…
goldenknights,lxpcjsg,2024-11-17 22:47:27,I wanna be happy for him did not have to be against us
goldenknights,lxpb4tp,2024-11-17 22:37:50,Yeah i dont think so cant  give up 2 goals each in the first 2 periods
goldenknights,lxosvrm,2024-11-17 20:42:37,Real
goldenknights,lxos2dz,2024-11-17 20:37:35,He sucked in Toronto no diff here
goldenknights,lxp1hb8,2024-11-17 21:35:49,Yeah we hit on him and hertl
goldenknights,lxp1p91,2024-11-17 21:37:10,I mean neither Hanifin nor Hertl seemed to really make any impact last season but they have really made their presence known this year.
goldenknights,lxoney0,2024-11-17 20:09:06,I can’t find it either it’s kinda pissing me off. I spend a small fortune on tv just to not be able to watch 
goldenknights,lxoos64,2024-11-17 20:17:27,What’s annoying is it’s the Caps broadcast but on NHL network
goldenknights,lxou4fn,2024-11-17 20:50:16,Yep always with the captials
goldenknights,lxp0ad5,2024-11-17 21:28:22,!naqvi
goldenknights,lxp064g,2024-11-17 21:27:36,NAQVI or Adam Kutner? lol
goldenknights,lxp2nmi,2024-11-17 21:43:04,Yeah Samsonov is good at that. Watched him a lot in Toronto he did that all the time. Couldn’t stop a beachball
goldenknights,lxpauow,2024-11-17 22:35:56,He asked to be traded. I hate this narrative
goldenknights,lxp6pr8,2024-11-17 22:08:43,That’s not what the stats say - 19 turnovers us 7 Caps.
goldenknights,lxojqda,2024-11-17 19:46:54,Yeah we're going 11/7
goldenknights,lxotn3r,2024-11-17 20:47:17,Yeah 1st periods are getting worse but second period has gotten better
goldenknights,lxozec4,2024-11-17 21:22:50,Will never leave again.
goldenknights,lxpihbh,2024-11-17 23:29:21,This isnt true yk how much shit hill got from the caines game not even close compared to sammy
goldenknights,lxpdrtt,2024-11-17 22:55:53,That’s the point. Too quick to throw some guys under the bus too patient on others.
goldenknights,lxos6c8,2024-11-17 20:38:14,He’ll be in Russia soon
goldenknights,lxp23hv,2024-11-17 21:39:37,Hertl made sense being injured and not having a true camp hanifin was weird just never clicked
goldenknights,lxp0bqq,2024-11-17 21:28:36,FUCK NAQVI INJURY LAW!
goldenknights,lxp08iw,2024-11-17 21:28:02,Answers the same. Insanely rich 
goldenknights,lxp0au9,2024-11-17 21:28:27,NAQVI haha dude is everywhere
goldenknights,lxp0hdd,2024-11-17 21:29:36,I get so many lawyer comercials ever since moving to Vegas in California hardly got any
goldenknights,lxpbdb9,2024-11-17 22:39:27,And why did he request to be traded? What contract basically told him he would never be our starter?
goldenknights,lxqwxsr,2024-11-18 07:39:12,Ok but why is this fan base so quick to give these guys shit? I don’t know how you justify it like that.
goldenknights,lxp0ucq,2024-11-17 21:31:50,I'm Italian and watching the ADs on the knights games gives me the biggest cultural shocks lol
goldenknights,lxpbi7p,2024-11-17 22:40:23,He didn’t want to be an A/B goalie hence why he asked to be traded. Didn’t want a 50% share load.
goldenknights,lxqx87t,2024-11-18 07:41:25,Idk all subs do it tho this sub isnt as bad compared to edmonton when skinner has a bad day
goldenknights,lxsgmkl,2024-11-18 12:58:34,That's every sports fanbase ever. It'll be toxic as hell towards coaches/players when there's a loss. Hate them with a burning hellfire if they lose love them if they win. And you'll never ever get them to see how childish it is.
goldenknights,lxp133x,2024-11-17 21:33:22,Yeah i thinj we have the most car accidents here so we got injury lawyers i swear we get a new firm every yr
goldenknights,lxqxadv,2024-11-18 07:41:53,They do it so it’s ok we do it. Pathetic.
goldenknights,lxqxk2e,2024-11-18 07:43:58,Yeah always a scapegoat for someone to find   i critique a player if they had a bad day but i wont ever say they suck on a bad night ir a bad stretch
goldenknights,lxqxofk,2024-11-18 07:44:54,If your first move is to hope on the internet to talk shit about someone after they have a rough night there’s a larger problem. Critique is fine but some of the shit I read is insane.
goldenknights,lxqy3zv,2024-11-18 07:48:11,Yeah trust me ik hell even during hill really good stretch of 6 1 1 he had one game where he got lit up 5 2 there was a whole thread how he isnt a good goalie
goldenknights,lxmerbh,2024-11-17 12:43:26,Ok boys Aussie here. You disappointed me against the Canes on Monday I didn't come all this way to watch you lose twice. I need a 5-1 win with ovi to score the first goal followed by an Eichel hat-trick with a goal by scorofeyev and barbie. Ok thanks bye.
goldenknights,lxln9xu,2024-11-17 10:08:40,Skate strong>Forecheck>Play Rebounds>Score Goals> Profit
goldenknights,lxnrk10,2024-11-17 17:04:54,Any chance tickets will fall to $30 or so tonight on AXS? Looking to give my parents a chance to watch a game live. They're gonna go stand in front of Tmo Arena in case...
goldenknights,lxo2xzo,2024-11-17 18:09:15,This is a very tough team for us but they are beatable. I am inspired by your dedication.
goldenknights,lxpevd8,2024-11-17 23:03:33,[deleted]
goldenknights,lxp4js7,2024-11-17 21:54:47,The passing was the issue. You forgot to put passing. That’s the thing we’re missing
goldenknights,lxo32dg,2024-11-17 18:09:58,This game was really expensive for some reason. Ovechkin is a draw but not that big. I saw some wild numbers when I picked mine up.
goldenknights,lxo6si1,2024-11-17 18:31:54,Looks like it’s quiet in the area so keep checking.
goldenknights,lxo3svd,2024-11-17 18:14:20,I didn't come all this way to watch them lose twice surely 1 win isn't too much to ask
goldenknights,lxpf97r,2024-11-17 23:06:17,Yeah being from Australia lots of things are upside down...
goldenknights,lxo7u57,2024-11-17 18:38:06,Yeah I noticed standing room are $59 today instead of the usual $49. Still an hour and a half before the game starts I think I can hold off I'm okay with $40 if its in the lower bowl.
goldenknights,lxo56qy,2024-11-17 18:22:28,I’m with you. I’ll be the one screaming hit him whenever Chicken gets close to our D.
goldenknights,lxlp5n6,2024-11-17 10:19:55,Goalie cut is going to look weird. 60 is basically a standard 3XL not a big and tall 3XL. If they are fitting a 4XL jacket and do not have much room then 60 is going to be way too small unless they are happy with it looking small and it stretching. Best bet is to buy a 4XL jersey from fanatics. It won’t be the same as what player wear exactly but it’ll probably fit better. You can buy it blank and have the higher quality numbers and lettering put on elsewhere.
goldenknights,lxn2pe2,2024-11-17 14:50:55,This is purely for others that come across this post and not directly related to OPs size requirements. I’m currently swimming in a Korczak game worn jersey. I’m 6’ 180lbs. Pads plus the extra couple of inches are impactful.
goldenknights,lxlavjk,2024-11-17 08:46:19,Hockey jersey subreddit is the way to go here
goldenknights,lxpvxwm,2024-11-18 01:20:44,"Concur 4XL breakaway jersey might work.  FYI the new Fanatics Authentic Pro largest size is labeled as 58+ but measures out to 60"" chest. Ignore team. Use the measurements as a guide.https://preview.redd.it/56gu4mp6sl1e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59300f0753dbaeafea7de8cc616f18d1818c388f"
goldenknights,lxmo8tx,2024-11-17 13:34:40,Fun story they auto ban posts about sizing! So no luck there unfortunately.
goldenknights,lxpw37c,2024-11-18 01:22:07,Also FAP are $425 in most places. More in others.
goldenknights,lxkitn7,2024-11-17 04:14:04,Barbashev - Eichel - Stone (just too good)Holtz - Hertl - DorofeyevHowden - Karlsson - OlofssonPearson - Roy - Kolesar  Love the option of having Olofsson back on the PP. I am really happy we're PP merchants.
goldenknights,lxjrh4v,2024-11-16 23:51:58,It’s definitely an interesting question. With him on LTIR and Stone hopefully coming back soon it would probably be a bottom six role. I could see him with Karlsson on the third line. But honestly I’m not super worried about it since he probably won’t stay in Vegas for long term with Theodore and McNabb getting extensions.
goldenknights,lxm5hcs,2024-11-17 11:51:56,My guess is the first and second lines won't change
goldenknights,lxjrrhf,2024-11-16 23:54:06,I hope these are the lines but I doubt this is what gets rolled outHertl-eichel-dorofeyevBarbie-karlson-stoneHowden-Roy-olofsonPearson-schwindt-kolesarI think these are decently balanced and I think hertl is better on the wing
goldenknights,lxjtmzf,2024-11-17 00:08:56,I’d love to know why you’re breaking up Barbie eichel and stone
goldenknights,lxjvzvt,2024-11-17 00:28:38,Yeah no kidding. I know that the original intention was for Karlsson and stone to be on the same line but the Eichel line looked even better with stone than it ever did with marchessault
goldenknights,lxkaieu,2024-11-17 02:42:55,I want to see hertl get going 5 v 5. I also think if we are a 1 line team in the playoffs we will be easier to beat. This lineup would give us more balance.
goldenknights,lxlq0zw,2024-11-17 10:25:05,Probably to make a more even team. Why have one top line when you can have two or three? I would like to see them try a more balanced approach some of the time and a loaded top line other times so in the playoffs coach can switch as needed.
goldenknights,lxkt625,2024-11-17 06:09:01,Are we a one line team though? The first line got all the praise because of how hot they were but with that original lineup eichel-Barbie-stone were great but so were hertl-doro-Howden and Roy-kolesar-Pearson. If you think that line was only one line of success I fear you’re thinking a bit one dimensionally

goldenknights,lxgsvh1,2024-11-16 13:09:29,I really like Hague for some reason but his play makes it really hard sometimes.
goldenknights,lxfo7ep,2024-11-16 09:20:36,Fascinating. Whitecloud and Hutton make way too many mistakes imo to be above Theodore and Korczak. I’d move them to 6 & 7 in your defense list. Korczak is probably a 5/6 on O. Maybe 4. Hague doesn’t make top 7 in either list imo.
goldenknights,lxgtenx,2024-11-16 13:12:22,I also really like Hague! I like all our players right now. I think Hague and Whitecloud were playing fantastic hockey the year we won the cup but they are not as brilliant since. I think our whole D corp has taken a bit of a step back but them particularly.Hopefully we get back in top notch form as the season keeps going.
goldenknights,lxfxmyd,2024-11-16 10:19:21,Theo is our best D overall. Our team struggles when he’s out of the lineup. He doesn’t get that contract extension if he’s not. He’s not the physical shutdown guy but he moves the puck well. Skates well and generates offence. You just have to look at who pairs against McDavid  and other teams top players. It’s either Petro Hanafin or Theo. The rest don’t stack up.
goldenknights,lxgtpxt,2024-11-16 13:14:05,There haven't been too many knights I haven't liked other than Nick Cousins.

goldenknights,lxddvmj,2024-11-15 21:30:49,Utah is kinda good just remember Arizona was really shit cause ownership kneecapped any budget for development and progress

goldenknights,lxdc2t5,2024-11-15 21:18:54,I’m originally from Utah. It’s a huge hockey state ever since the 2002 Olympics. Upwards of probably a couple thousand youth hockey players at least a dozen times at every age level about 50 high school teams over a dozen public rinks several hockey stores that aren’t just rink pro shops. So there’s gonna be sooooo many fans of this Utah team. Season tickets sold out crazy fast the line for the jersey drop today was apparently massive. Not to mention the fact that Utah is one of if not *the* winter sport state.
goldenknights,lxdcg66,2024-11-15 21:21:21,Old man has been having a great season

goldenknights,lxd1lpz,2024-11-15 20:11:19,It worked for Jon Merrill a few years ago. One game at forward and he scored a goal
goldenknights,lxdsgj0,2024-11-15 23:09:00,Exactly. Not just their player their out of position goalie.

goldenknights,lxdxhsg,2024-11-15 23:45:17,Maybe not the team itself but their commentators were such Homers (Beyond the usual). Also feel like AZ people have been robbed of a team somewhat.

goldenknights,lxdxoat,2024-11-15 23:46:41,Fair. Not really the fans or the teams fault though. Homer announcers are the norm we just get to have an exceptional broadcast team.
goldenknights,lxdt4d1,2024-11-15 23:13:53,The way it tipped forward I assumed it was the goalie. Either way really bad call.
goldenknights,lxdy1l5,2024-11-15 23:49:27,Hence beyond the usual. But also I wasn't saying fuck their fans lol the owner who shifted the team doesn't deserve any success. But mostly it was just a get fucked [opponent] after a come back win in general.

goldenknights,lxb6zwa,2024-11-15 14:04:38,Takeaways:* Little surprised he’s getting extended in the first place given Korczak’s emergence but always happy to keep an OG misfit around.* Here’s one of those “loyalty” contracts we don’t often sign lol.* He’s defensively great and his game’s never been based on speed so despite his age this contact shouldn’t age poorly unless he just forgets how to play hockey. * Value is fine with the rising cap.* Does probably mean Hague (RFA) is gone in the offseason - that kinda sucks seeing as he’s been our most successful in-house prospect.
goldenknights,lxb6ccz,2024-11-15 14:01:24,Official numbers:3 year deal $3650000 annual cap hit. This is an $800k raise from his current contract of $2850000He turns 34 in January. McNabb will be 37 at the end of this deal
goldenknights,lxb7knn,2024-11-15 14:07:31,Great deal. Probably the most underrated piece on the blue line if not on the whole team. Not worried about the term at all not like his game relies on foot speed. THREE MORE YEARS OF HIP CHECKS

goldenknights,lxccgw7,2024-11-15 17:38:54,Absolutely worth every penny you wouldn’t even know he’s at the tail-end of the average NHL career in terms of age because his style of play is perfect for an aging dman
goldenknights,lxc5396,2024-11-15 16:58:34,One of the best pure defensemen in the league. Love this deal love it.
goldenknights,lxb6soe,2024-11-15 14:03:39,That's an interesting AAV. I wonder what that does to our cap space going to next season...
goldenknights,lxbtpgm,2024-11-15 16:00:24,Don’t think you realize just how good mcnabb is at what he does. Yes he’s old but the dude is a hitting and blocking and forecheck disrupting machine. He makes mistakes like everyone else but he’s a dogg in the dzone. Korczak is well on his way but he’s not anywhere near ready for mcnabbs role. Just too important of a position and d take longer to develop
goldenknights,lxba453,2024-11-15 14:20:16,It uses $3.65 million of it.
goldenknights,lxbmkqq,2024-11-15 15:24:09,Booooooo^^/s
goldenknights,lxaacjq,2024-11-15 11:23:20,Kind of surprising given his age but I do love what Nabber brings to the table.
goldenknights,lxagynx,2024-11-15 11:55:51,Very okay with this. Beast in his own end and it's not like his game relies on foot speed so not too worried about his age. Great leader on the blue line.
goldenknights,lxba7eo,2024-11-15 14:20:42,Honestly he's been so dependable and brings such a consistent and stable physical presence to the line up. He wasn't a misfit I thought would be around forever but it just kind of makes sense now. Defenseman like him are very rare and really important to a lineup
goldenknights,lxajkbb,2024-11-15 12:08:38,Hell yeah! WE NABBED HIM!
goldenknights,lxavnxn,2024-11-15 13:08:46,Genuinely surprised by this one. Though he’s been one of our best defensively + will age well given his game isn’t based on speed I figured with Korczak ready to go Nabber would’ve been on the way out. Happy for him tho - he’ll always be my favorite misfit for tossing me a warmup puck a few weeks ago Guess this means Hague is probably traded away though which kinda sucks.
goldenknights,lxbn9nu,2024-11-15 15:27:42,McNabb is easily one of our best defensive players. He usually has a high +/- and he is very smart about when to pinch in
goldenknights,lxabmcp,2024-11-15 11:29:35,Well it all depends on how many years is multi-year. Martinez was 36 with the team last year and I don't think his age was much of a factor. Brayden will be 34 come January so 3 year deal is probably fine
goldenknights,lxabjz0,2024-11-15 11:29:15,Yeah with his age and 4 other dmen locked up for a few years I was assuming Hague and Korzcak would be the other two. I guess the GMs don't see us keeping one of them.
goldenknights,lxaewyk,2024-11-15 11:45:50,There are probably quite a few out clauses but if I’m in the nhl I’d want to play for/in Vegas. Hope that they’ll put a couple of the young guns on the line with him because he’d be a great trainer
goldenknights,lxafdlf,2024-11-15 11:48:08,Always cool to see an OG misfit stay.
goldenknights,lxaelyh,2024-11-15 11:44:21,Martinez had pretty clearly lost a step IMO
goldenknights,lxacfji,2024-11-15 11:33:36,Eh.. I’m kinda over Hague
goldenknights,lxacbp1,2024-11-15 11:33:05,I think Whitecloud is the odd man out. Hague and Korczak are younger and taller. And personally I think Korczak has looked better than Whitecloud even though he’s played less games.
goldenknights,lxak27i,2024-11-15 12:11:05,"Yeah but that really felt more like ""forced to take nearly a  season off due to serious injury and not finding the motivation to get all the way back when I've already got three cups and a SCF and WCF OT winner on my resume"" kind of step back and not so much a ""drop off a cliff because I'm old"" step back"
goldenknights,lxaenyw,2024-11-15 11:44:38,Maybe but he is signed for 3 more years at a fairly team friendly deal and Hague is an rfa after this year. We may need money elsewhere to pay Eichel Doro and other forwards the next couple years.
goldenknights,lxaf4qy,2024-11-15 11:46:53,Taller isn’t a metric to be concerned with
goldenknights,lxah6us,2024-11-15 11:56:59,Very true. Guess we will have to wait and see.
goldenknights,lxag6ij,2024-11-15 11:52:02,It’s not at the top of the list absolutely but I do think size is something teams value.
goldenknights,lxagchs,2024-11-15 11:52:50,Sure but if the athlete doesn’t know how to use his size then it’s pointless
goldenknights,lxa7su0,2024-11-15 11:10:47,TBD’s: The Big Doofus’s
goldenknights,lxadiuy,2024-11-15 11:39:03,The TBD’S 
goldenknights,lx9d5tp,2024-11-15 08:24:28,Let’s go!
goldenknights,lxbfk5j,2024-11-15 14:48:22,Got 'em
goldenknights,lx80eqk,2024-11-15 01:14:04,Fuck I wasn't planning on spending any money.
goldenknights,lxbmkoe,2024-11-15 15:24:08,Damn easy buy. Thank you OP
goldenknights,lx6en8o,2024-11-14 19:16:06,Knights fans are fun and accepting. I have been on the party deck and it isn’t bad but you if you give up your spot on the rail it gets difficult to see. You kind of have to squish in and it might be difficult for your daughter depending on how tall she is. Even if you are in the seats the fans will all be throwing up high fives on goals and having fun. I haven’t shelled out the cash to watch super close yet I have gotten multiple sro seats and imo the only place that you can’t see the game is in the Hyde lounge. I’m short so it does get difficult to see sometimes when people stand up but if you’re on the rail you’re typically good.
goldenknights,lx71q4l,2024-11-14 21:25:50,Box seats are the only option unless you are some kind of barbarian & want to mix with the peasants!!
goldenknights,lx6go8l,2024-11-14 19:27:20,Oh sorry I wasn’t clear in my post. I’m seeing VGK IN Ottawa next week and we r close. When I go next month I’ll be solo and am looking to meet other fans (hopefully) … but if I can’t watch the game then I guess that answered my Q… watching the game vs chatting w fans is not worth it if I can’t see lol thx for sharing ur view
goldenknights,lx6sf0q,2024-11-14 20:33:43,Yeah the party deck isn’t great if you’re not tall. I’m 6’ 4” and get frustrated if I need a bathroom break because your rail spot will be gone. Only 1 side of the party deck does the bottomless food/drink but I wouldn’t recommend it. The price I’ve seen for the all inclusive side of party deck is not worth it. The other side is just regular standing room only with no extra benefits. Honestly I love the upper deck because there’s not a bad seat and I prefer to see the action from higher up. Definitely avoid the Hyde Lounge like other poster said. It’s a club in the arena with TV views only unless you pay a lot extra for a booth.
goldenknights,lxctolh,2024-11-15 19:21:46,Great advice since I’m only 5’3”. I’ll try to grab a seat close to the ice!
goldenknights,lxe7o2i,2024-11-16 01:10:00,Most importantly have fun! Vegas fans are great hosts… I think most of us are still just so grateful to have a team and some of us even got a Stanley Cup tattooed on our wrist! 
goldenknights,lx5cmjv,2024-11-14 15:55:48,Me! Going to the arena incognito in the morning when the Utah jerseys drop to get a pair for memorabilia purposes. Then going home to change into my VGK jersey and plushie Chance hat for the game.
goldenknights,lx6edq9,2024-11-14 19:14:39,Packing now to drive down in the AM
goldenknights,lx6k87b,2024-11-14 19:47:12,I live up here so I’ll be going
goldenknights,lx6u92m,2024-11-14 20:43:54,I’d love to but it’s not in the cards. Have fun buddy!
goldenknights,lx6zlcj,2024-11-14 21:13:30,Just FYI from 8-12 it is STH only in the team shop.
goldenknights,lx78i9f,2024-11-14 22:04:51,"Yep I am planning for that. Gonna line up at around 11 and hope for the best. We want that inaugural season patch. I wasn't into hockey yet when VGK was born and moved to SLC a couple months into their first season  so I'm trying to get as much as I can out of living 2 miles away from UHC when they're ""born""? ""Transitioning""? Even though I'm loyal to the Vegas soil."
anaheimducks,lxtqimi,2024-11-18 16:49:58,I have a coworker who works at Angel’s Stadium.  I’ll go ahead and ask her later. I can PM you after.
anaheimducks,lxtsmf4,2024-11-18 17:00:40,I appreciate itthank you.
anaheimducks,lxtcg4c,2024-11-18 15:39:10,Even on the secondary market $38 for a ticket is a solid good price I doubt you'll find anything better. But yes there tends to be good deals on game days.
anaheimducks,lxtc8sx,2024-11-18 15:38:08,Id say wait you can get them usually for $22-$24
anaheimducks,lxtfral,2024-11-18 15:55:43,May help to specify which game you were looking at as well becuase the team they play and what day of the week plays a decent part in ticket prices. 38 for an original 6 or kings game that’s actually on the cheaper end but 38 for an out of division smaller fan base team yea it’ll get cheaper. I always bounce between the major hubs (Ticketmaster stub hub game time) but usually just end up goin Ticketmaster since I feel like its the easiest to pick the exact seats I’m getting instead. But I’ve seen some super cheap seats on Gametime and there’s usually coupon codes floating around.
anaheimducks,lxtn35f,2024-11-18 16:32:36,I was looking to go to fridays game against the buffalo sabers
anaheimducks,lxu337g,2024-11-18 17:56:51,What do you guys think about the Brewery X Biergarten option? Sorry I don’t know much about this venue I’m taking my bf on a surprise date
anaheimducks,lxtf9wi,2024-11-18 15:53:18,Where’s do they have the cheapest tickets?
anaheimducks,lxtl3xc,2024-11-18 16:22:35,714 tickets at like 5PM lol
anaheimducks,lxrx6ky,2024-11-18 11:20:20,Sig looks good but that jersey is faf.
anaheimducks,lxs5loy,2024-11-18 12:03:19,Just wanted to tell you that Guy Hebert was better than Tom Barasso
anaheimducks,lxsspm5,2024-11-18 13:59:12,He’s at every home game just take it and ask him 
anaheimducks,lxrycbq,2024-11-18 11:26:22,Aight thank you. I'm not super duper concerned with the jersey we're prolly just find a shadowbox to put it in. I was really just concerned with the sig.
anaheimducks,lxsk9rv,2024-11-18 13:17:01,Ok. I was just asking about the sig man 
anaheimducks,lxtfes2,2024-11-18 15:53:59,Dog I'm in Arkansas  I can't just go to Anaheim on a whim lol
anaheimducks,lxrysc1,2024-11-18 11:28:39,Sorry. I'm just very passionate when it comes to jerseys so when I see fakes I can get a little...flustered lol!But yeah the sig looks legit.
anaheimducks,lxrz5ea,2024-11-18 11:30:32,Nah! I get it! I understand for sure!

anaheimducks,lxqzt4n,2024-11-18 08:00:44,Is the game on Victory+ or on Victory+?
anaheimducks,lxsmczo,2024-11-18 13:27:29,Gonna see the Ducks in person this time! Excited in the sense I see the team not looking forward to the massacre that’s gonna go down.
anaheimducks,lxsspw6,2024-11-18 13:59:14,This should go well (/s)
anaheimducks,lxre57p,2024-11-18 09:34:54,LET'S GO DUCKS
anaheimducks,lxsopxb,2024-11-18 13:39:19,Damn Stars are 7-1 at home lol
anaheimducks,lxt35o1,2024-11-18 14:51:44,At least we get the back up tendy
anaheimducks,lxt8dn1,2024-11-18 15:18:27,This is gonna be a tough one. The Stars are deep as a mother fucker
anaheimducks,lxttebf,2024-11-18 17:04:42,It should be fun to see the Calder front-runner in action if nothing else.
anaheimducks,lxu10qk,2024-11-18 17:45:29,With the call-up of Hinds we only have 4 d-prospects in the hopper.Solberg Dionicio Warren and Luneau.Remember when we had such a huge logjam at D so what's his face left to SJS?
anaheimducks,lxrv9xr,2024-11-18 11:10:18,One is on Victory+ the other is on Defeat-
anaheimducks,lxte2s8,2024-11-18 15:47:22,Why? I'm looking forward to it. Unfortunately we won't get chicken after the game though since it's not at home
anaheimducks,lxsz02z,2024-11-18 14:30:44,It would be funny as hell if the Ducks broke the homestreak
anaheimducks,lxu2hys,2024-11-18 17:53:35,You forgot T. Smith K. Smith Uljanskis Port and Moore.I left off Francis because at this point his health has limited him to only 37 games in the last 5 years.
anaheimducks,lxs9er0,2024-11-18 12:22:37,This comment needs more recognition. 
anaheimducks,lxtjcu7,2024-11-18 16:13:48,I’m looking forward to the game as always! If they do bad I expected it if they don’t I’ll be surprised. I’ll put it that way I guess lol
anaheimducks,lxt075e,2024-11-18 14:36:46,When a stoppable force meets an almost unmovable object.
anaheimducks,lxu3ol5,2024-11-18 18:00:10,I should have clarified folks signed to an ELC lol.I'm not confident any of those listed are going to make the roster.
anaheimducks,lxu62y1,2024-11-18 18:13:53,I'd go a little further. Outside of Luneau and Solberg I'm not convinced we have any players outside of the regular rostered players who will challenge for full-time jobs - at least not for the Ducks.
anaheimducks,lxu81ly,2024-11-18 18:25:15,Fair enough team can only have so many contracts at one time though and most other teams aren't carrying any more contracts for defensemen than we are. I would also say our depth at the position is still top teir. There aren't many other teams who's non-rostered defensmen could top our group of Solberg Dionicio Warren Luneau as far as prospect value.I would also expect Tarin Smith to end up on an ELC at some point once the season ends and we have more contracts available he's been tearing it up this season in the WHL. Also wouldn't be surprised to see Moore sign at the end of the college season this year and get in a game or two a la Lacombe unless he decides to go the Thrun route and request a trade.The rest I agree are kind of up in the air.
anaheimducks,lxu6wzp,2024-11-18 18:18:43,Yeah as sad as I am to admit it I was super hopeful for Warren's big frame to eventually replace Josh Manson as the ragdoll master but he hasn't even gotten 1 game yet so maybe he's just not there yet and might never be (I don't watch the AHL but his statsheet looks sad).The rest all seem like they're replacement-level guys that will be in/out of waivers & trades.Dionicio spent the summer training with Timo Meier though so who knows maybe he keeps developing over the next year or so and breaks through.
anaheimducks,lxu8wn8,2024-11-18 18:30:14,idk he's big so he'll get some games but not sure he's got much more than 6th/7th man energy. But maybe we need that for a third pairing role. By need that I mean the MG really likes tall players and whether they can skate or score seems optional.RE Dionicio I'm just not convinced we need more left shot offensive players on the blueline. With the current roster I feel like players of that ilk are more trade inclusions than full time ducks. Besides that Dionicio isn't the best skater or defensive player. Great boom/bust pick but not sure he's got a regular roster post. Keep improving his skating he's a chance but... only if there's a clear spot available for him and I don't think there is unless they make a trade.EDIT: Also this is why the Sennecke pick was so weird. Strong defensive draft limited D prospects and we take a tall forward who was being out performed by 2025 draft hopefuls? Just an odd decisions. Will be a defining turning point for the next era of ducks hockey IMO.
anaheimducks,lxu9o3m,2024-11-18 18:34:41,Yeah I don't think Dio is gonna crack the roster unless/until Fowler/Dumoulin are gone and he gets called up as a 7th (Minty/Zellweger/LC should be the 1-2-3 on the left side).Makes me wonder when we're ever gonna use that cap space to sign a proper 1st pairing RHD.
anaheimducks,lxpcq8d,2024-11-17 22:48:40,Wasn’t overly impressed but it’s also his first game in a while at NHL speed so hope he just needs some adjusting. We’ll find out what he can do after a few games.Unrelated; Next time you interview Cronin could you ask; why the frequent lineup changes what is the end goal? And is McT ever going to be tried at wing whenever he's back now that Z looks firmly stuck at centre once again?  Thanks.
anaheimducks,lxpbi0q,2024-11-17 22:40:21,yeah idk. He engaged physically which was nice to see. And we can definitely use a right shot. But... man his first period was just so bad. He cleaned up a bit in the next couple periods but I just can't see him as much more than a 6th/7th defenceman. It's fine just not that worried about him making it or not at this stage.
anaheimducks,lxpzvrl,2024-11-18 01:59:11,I’m not reading the article but I definitely don’t agree with the title.
anaheimducks,lxpczrs,2024-11-17 22:50:30,Answer: team cant score goals.  have to and find chemistry and produce more goals.
anaheimducks,lxpez0i,2024-11-17 23:04:15,The lines stayed the same for the first 10 games with little scoring no?
anaheimducks,lxqmbot,2024-11-18 06:04:20,Why?
anaheimducks,lxpjkd5,2024-11-17 23:37:19,Sure but we found that with Vatrano - Strome - Terry and that was disbanded. It's made a return now and then but it's not been a mainstay like it should be. Cutter - Z - Killorn looked quite good especially Cutter - Z but that was also broken up. Like I don't see what the longterm aim is it just comes off as random.
anaheimducks,lxqjrpb,2024-11-18 05:37:24,Team can't score goals regardless. His line shuffling is just plain stupid that's the real answer
anaheimducks,lxqnw3m,2024-11-18 06:20:05,Because him getting called up due to injuries and playing for a brief stint isn’t going to make or break his spot with the team. He’s still young. He improved from 2022 to 2023 in the AHL and is only going to get better IMO. I know it’s been a rough season for him on the Gulls this season but that whole team is terrible. But him Hinds and Warren are the somewhat future for us defensively in the AHL. And that doesn’t even count all the younger guys in the OHL or ECHL.
anaheimducks,lxrmqg2,2024-11-18 10:24:32,He won’t be our future defensively in the AHL. This is his last season of being waiver exempt. That means after this season he’s either on the Ducks or lost on waivers when we try to send him down in camp or after his first call up. There’s quite literally a gaping hole on our right side D pipeline so I would say this is a make our break opportunity for him.
anaheimducks,lxohtv1,2024-11-17 19:35:39,I miss when they used to play Bulls on Parade.
anaheimducks,lxophrk,2024-11-17 20:21:48,Yes I still listen to this on the way to games
anaheimducks,lxoofev,2024-11-17 20:15:17,"I've never seen ""empire of the sun"" and ""banger"" used in the same sentence. I get everyone has their taste so take my comment with a grain of salt lol. I'm more of a VG/HC guy so I obviously want to hear more The Ghost inside type vibe."
anaheimducks,lxo5k6i,2024-11-17 18:24:39,Makes me wonder if McT has been playing through something. He hasn’t been himself in a contract year.
anaheimducks,lxo8voq,2024-11-17 18:44:08,I would normally be pretty bummed by our injuries but we actually have better depth.  Colangelo could give the team a boost he has been killing it in SD.
anaheimducks,lxo8ja8,2024-11-17 18:42:09,Is IR like NFL IR?
anaheimducks,lxorzo6,2024-11-17 20:37:07,Colangelo has been having a great season in San Diego. It'll be cool to see what he can bring to the Ducks (or at least see what he can learn during this call-up).
anaheimducks,lxo516r,2024-11-17 18:21:33,I think I saw when Mason got hurt. It was that one shift where he coasted around the defensive zone.
anaheimducks,lxqace4,2024-11-18 03:52:34,Is this Hinds first time being called up or has he made his NHL debut already?
anaheimducks,lxq5wcr,2024-11-18 03:02:56,Gauthier - Colangelo on the wings looks fun. wonder who's gonna center them if Cro decides to roll with itI am no coach but in NHL 25 I would do something like thatVatrano-Zegras-Terry  Gauthier-Carlsson-Colangelo  Killorn-Lundestrom-Strome  Johnston-Harkins-Leason
anaheimducks,lxo56sk,2024-11-17 18:22:29,FUCK
anaheimducks,lxol5pw,2024-11-17 19:55:25,Kinda curious about Hinds being called up. Did they lose another player? Or send Helleson back down?
anaheimducks,lxol5dy,2024-11-17 19:55:22,Actual gameplay aside his discipline has been Nick Ritchie level bad. I’m hopeful he can kinda take some time and reassess his role out there while he’s rehabbing. He has the body to be a great power forward he just needs to figure out how to use it and not get penalized for it.
anaheimducks,lxtl02h,2024-11-18 16:22:03,I have a feeling he injured his back while lifting he just doesn't look as agile as he was last year.
anaheimducks,lxodqf0,2024-11-17 19:12:23,Also mact might need some time off ice. If he's been carrying an injury it would be better for him to heal as much as possible and maybe he needs more time with coaches and stuff not just between games to try and get his head and his on ice play back to what he has shown in the past
anaheimducks,lxogl5b,2024-11-17 19:28:26,9 goals in 14 games damn. Put him on Zegras' wing.
anaheimducks,lxod20y,2024-11-17 19:08:29,basically yeah it's a minimum of 7 days instead of 4 games
anaheimducks,lxo8qen,2024-11-17 18:43:17,He got hurt that many times?
anaheimducks,lxqe11y,2024-11-18 04:34:15,He’ll play his first game
anaheimducks,lxqgu2u,2024-11-18 05:05:39,You are funny with those lines. It' be like thisVatrano-Lundestrom-LeasonKillorn-Harkins-StromeJohnston-Carlsson-TerryGauthier-Zegras-Colangelo
anaheimducks,lxpzmz7,2024-11-18 01:56:44,I think it's for Vaak the team said he was being evaluated for injury without any other details
anaheimducks,lxs381w,2024-11-18 11:51:13,And not get thrown out at so many face-offs.
anaheimducks,lxojyak,2024-11-17 19:48:11,Yep healing from injuries but also a mental reset could do macT some favors.  Watching the games in the press box can definitely help.
anaheimducks,lxodg3j,2024-11-17 19:10:42,Thanks. 7 days isn’t anything like the 4 weeks so nice to know he could be back sooner than a month.
anaheimducks,lxol97d,2024-11-17 19:55:59,jesus dude. I just choked on my coffee
anaheimducks,lxqs5es,2024-11-18 06:59:29,Knowing Cronin your scheme wouldn't surprise me lol
anaheimducks,lxq07qo,2024-11-18 02:02:33,Ah cheers
anaheimducks,lxp3m61,2024-11-17 21:48:58,NFL IR is so long. 4 games is just about 1/4 the season. That’s like 20 NHL games.
anaheimducks,lxp39je,2024-11-17 21:46:48,Coffee at sundown? Caffeine probably doesnt do anything for you huh
anaheimducks,lxp4zrt,2024-11-17 21:57:37,Ah well I’m currently in very very outback Australia but no not really. I’ve cut down to 6ish a day though just because
anaheimducks,lxmhl7r,2024-11-17 12:59:01,Well done!
anaheimducks,lxmyttp,2024-11-17 14:29:51,Thanks! :D
anaheimducks,lxis7zn,2024-11-16 19:53:42,Been a fan since Kariya and Teemu loved the Stanley Cup hated losing to the Kings and Hawks in our golden years and have been miserable ever since. If you want to join in on the misery you're more than welcome.
anaheimducks,lxisl3j,2024-11-16 19:55:57,Of course you can be a Ducks fan but buckle up lol. The team is embroiled in its darkest ever era. Personally I was born and raised like 5 minutes from then Arrowhead Pond the Ducks are the reason I even  know and care about hockey.
anaheimducks,lxiwvmf,2024-11-16 20:23:05,Been a ducks fan since they were Minneapolis district 5(iykyk). Not sure about traditions never made it to Cali I do keep a duck call on me at all times tho
anaheimducks,lxj3ooe,2024-11-16 21:06:17,https://preview.redd.it/zqmp1kitdd1e1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30b3216028747db0246bb55a6c97491634839ee7And yes we accept our desert bretheren
anaheimducks,lxiydpw,2024-11-16 20:32:31,Im a Wisconsin fan that could never cheer for a Chicago team. Mighty Ducks just felt right.Now that I'm a bigger hockey fan I now realize that the Nashville Predators are actually Wisconsins team.Too late to change my Fandom. I'm a Milwuakee Admirals/Anahiem Ducks fan.
anaheimducks,lxj7n84,2024-11-16 21:32:27,I’m a Duck’s fan because I’m born and raised in OC and as much as I actually love LA fuck the Kings.
anaheimducks,lxiv46y,2024-11-16 20:11:54,I just joined the Quack life. I live in Florida and wanted to start following hockey after going to some local ECHL games which were just a ton of fun so started loosely following hockey after just trying to learn the rules. I ended up seeing a short of Zegras going a Michigan goal and that it was the coolest think I’d ever seen. Watch a highlight video and then was like he plays for the mighty Ducks? And since then I’ve been here.It isn’t great being east coast for a west coast team but it’s nice to not feel like I have to watch every game. 10 pm games during the week are a no go and I’m happy with that.
anaheimducks,lxixdmv,2024-11-16 20:26:18,Since 94. Came to Florida on holiday from Scotland when I was 10. Disney stores had the jerseys and all memorabilia at the parks available so I went nuts. Had a duck whistle tee and the away jersey. As long as you denounce the actions of Jay Beagle and that ass commentator who justified Beagle jumping Troy Terry you can join
anaheimducks,lxivths,2024-11-16 20:16:22,Born in New York and played hockey all my life but moved to San Pedro in kindergarten and my first nhl game was Ducks inaugural season in 1993 at the Arrowhead. Seen all the highs and lows so there ain't no turning back now!
anaheimducks,lxj2mq5,2024-11-16 20:59:24,Full cards on table I was a kid growing up in Alaska so I loved hockey and the best team I knew was the Anchorage Aces so I grew up playing hockey. Then the Mighty Ducks movie came out…. Been along for the ride ever since. Now I live near the Honda Center and my daughter and I go to games. I also really like the fan base. It’s been a real child friendly stadium every time I’ve gone.
anaheimducks,lxiwes1,2024-11-16 20:20:07,Absolutely you can come on board but I’d advise against it lol
anaheimducks,lxiwk52,2024-11-16 20:21:04,I was there when it was written.
anaheimducks,lxixj11,2024-11-16 20:27:14,Duck pride also comes with shame then pride then shame and so on so on. Ima day one  and can say welcome to the best flock
anaheimducks,lxj1495,2024-11-16 20:49:43,I’ve been a fan since I was a little kid. I was born in ‘92 in socal and when I was old enough my dad introduced me to hockey. Being a kid I liked the name mighty ducks and it helped that we had some good players (selanne kariya). My parents were also Czech immigrants and I believe we had a Czech player at the time so my dad was happy to take me to games. I watched the ducks all my life. I unfortunately moved to Colorado as an adult but I still catch a lot of ducks games even though we suck now. I’m still reminiscing the days of getzlaf and Perry and Bobby Ryan as our top line with giggy or hiller in net. I loved that time.For what it’s worth this sucks core reminds me a lot of the old ducks from like 2005 but more raw. Carlsson is the real deal and he will be our next getzalf. Dostal is amazing and zwelleger will be our neidermeyer.
anaheimducks,lxj26v9,2024-11-16 20:56:34,I'm from Anaheim
anaheimducks,lxjwhkz,2024-11-17 00:32:44,Fate mostly. Long story fan since 2002. But I don’t regret choosing the Ducks over my local team (Canucks). Being a Ducks fan was the best thing that ever happened to me hockey-wise. Not to mention I’ve seen it all from the lowest lows to the highest highs. It is a ride.
anaheimducks,lxiy6rk,2024-11-16 20:31:18,I went to my first ducks game when I was 8 in 1993. Grew up in the area and with the team because my parents (who are from Philly and Pittsburgh) wanted to make sure I loved hockey as much as they do l even if it wasn't cheering for their teams. Now we (my husband and I. My parents live an hour north of us) live in Philly and can catch way more flyers games but I still watch as much of the ducks games as I can before falling asleep. We welcome anyone who wants to be a fan!
anaheimducks,lxj2wej,2024-11-16 21:01:11,I'm from LA and the mighty ducks were on TV one day
anaheimducks,lxj6pal,2024-11-16 21:26:13,I’m a ducks fan because my husband’s sister has been a ducks fan her whole life and she got me into hockey when I started dating her brother. It was just the natural choice.
anaheimducks,lxjiap3,2024-11-16 22:43:56,Closest professional team
anaheimducks,lxiueli,2024-11-16 20:07:25,My aunt lives next to the old Westminster rink and whenever I’d visit I’d go there. But also I didn’t want to jump in the kings band wagon way back when. So they were the next most available. I was fairly casual and then they eventually got my favourite ever player (Federov) and while he wasn’t here long… well supporting a sports team isn’t a feeble commitment like marriage it’s no 3.3 years and move into the next it’s for life.
anaheimducks,lxix1o6,2024-11-16 20:24:10,Come on for the ride but it’s a roller coaster lol
anaheimducks,lxj1vza,2024-11-16 20:54:39,I went to my first Ducks game for a buddy’s bachelor party and I’ve been a fan ever since. Granted I’m a casual fan but a fan nonetheless.
anaheimducks,lxj26nr,2024-11-16 20:56:32,Adam banks duh
anaheimducks,lxj3bn3,2024-11-16 21:03:56,I joined the Ducks fandom because I like ducks.…That’s about it. I’d say it’s a net positive considering I now have Olen Zellweger in my life.
anaheimducks,lxj54ch,2024-11-16 21:15:46,Maybe we're masochists. Maybe we're optimists. We likely hate ourselves at least a little.  In whatever case join the club we've got lots of room for self-loathing.  In seriousness we know the heart of this team is in it. The pride of the association is there. But we've got a lot of young guys who have the potential with some really well balanced veteran experience that just aren't meeting where they should and causes some serious demoralization on the ice during game time and we can all see it when it almost instantly hits the line. In spite of it all we've got hope that the right leadership will turn the ship eventually.   Maybe.
anaheimducks,lxj5er2,2024-11-16 21:17:40,Of course movies were a portion of it but when the Ducks were playing back in 95-96 or so I was really into hockey and enjoyed watching them play. I just remember being a fan of Kariya and watching him play. Fast foward like 23 years later and I want to get back into Hockey again and I liked the Ducks and I didn't mind a team in a rebuild but well here we are like year 7 of a rebuild lol.
anaheimducks,lxj7noh,2024-11-16 21:32:32,If you like disappointment this is the place for you!
anaheimducks,lxj7uny,2024-11-16 21:33:48,For me it was simple. Wasn't fond of the queens or guppies then BOOM the ducks were born and I was in like sin
anaheimducks,lxj9s67,2024-11-16 21:46:38,Watched the movies and got a jersey as a gift. Haven’t stopped since. Been a fun 20Years.
anaheimducks,lxjagrv,2024-11-16 21:51:12,When my mom worked in Goodwill (early 00’s) she used to get free tickets to games since they knew she had kids so that’s what started it all. This was back when Chistov Kariya Oates and Rucchin were still around. We knew nothing about hockey but learned to love the game as a family. I’m happy I got to experience that as a kid because those are some of my favorite memories growing up. Cool part now that I’m older is that my niece and nephew get to go to games and experience what I did as a kid. I’m happy to be a Ducks fan.
anaheimducks,lxjdq65,2024-11-16 22:13:01,Join us! As a CA transplant now living in the Valley Ducks/Yotes have a lot in common. I was even a season ticket holder when they played in Glendale. Ducks fly together and you’re always welcome!
anaheimducks,lxje8ro,2024-11-16 22:16:26,Because of that Movie called Champions (aka Mighty Ducks 1) Gordon Bombay & Charlie Conway made a kid from a tropical country loved a sport on ice & hey that girl goalie in D2 Julie? is 
anaheimducks,lxjfvz8,2024-11-16 22:27:27,Because I enjoy pain.
anaheimducks,lxjjmwa,2024-11-16 22:53:03,Just started watching hockey last year and was wondering who to support. Lived in Toronto but didn't really like the team that much so tried to support a US team instead. Stumbled across the Ducks cause of their old logo & jersey but also because I love supporting weaker/underperforming teams.
anaheimducks,lxjknvl,2024-11-16 23:00:19,My neighbor growing up(in CT) was a massive Devils fan in the 90’s when they were amazing. I called him a bandwagon fan and asked which was the worst team. That being the ducks first year and I’ve been a fan ever since.
anaheimducks,lxjme01,2024-11-16 23:13:00,I come from a young mom and dad living in LA. They had me when they were 18 so being young still my mom had a Disney bug. She took me to Disneyland a lot and in 1999 she was given tickets to a mighty ducks game at Disneyland by a family and had taken me every year after till the ownership change. I kept being a fan of the Ducks going forward. I cried tears of joy as a kid when won the cup being aware of what happened in 03My mom still has a stub from 03 when we faced the avalanche at the pond. Love looking at when I go over to her house since the only stub we have still.
anaheimducks,lxjoqrx,2024-11-16 23:30:48,I am a ducks fan since day 1 from wisconsin originally cali born. My goal is to see a home game in anahiem!!
anaheimducks,lxjp7ah,2024-11-16 23:34:23,You are not disloyal. They left us. I've lived in Orange County for awhile so it was an easy switch.
anaheimducks,lxjt4ys,2024-11-17 00:04:52,There was this movie that came out and I was born/lived in the city of Anaheim. Didn't really have a choice I guess. All are welcome to the fandom.
anaheimducks,lxjtr26,2024-11-17 00:09:54,Been a Ducks fan my entire life. Born into it and originally from Orange County so first hockey game was a ducks game
anaheimducks,lxjy5y5,2024-11-17 00:46:20,Born/raised in Orange County
anaheimducks,lxk8cg9,2024-11-17 02:20:02,Because I was obsessed with The Mighty Ducks movies as a kid. I just happened to be lucky enough that they were my local team. I went to games and fell in love with hockey. So basically my entire life? And new fans are always welcome!
anaheimducks,lxk9x9g,2024-11-17 02:36:37,I live in Wisconsin was just getting interested in hockey and got invited to watch the playoffs at a friends house (they're Blackhawk fans).  I refuse to support any Chicago teams and they happened to be playing the Ducks that year.
anaheimducks,lxlxb3y,2024-11-17 11:06:56,I just love the logo it's my favorite across every sport
anaheimducks,lxj5q2z,2024-11-16 21:19:43,Loosely since I was a kid cause of the movies. I live in Southern California and they are my closest team too.
anaheimducks,lxkbci8,2024-11-17 02:51:50,Lol I'm a ducks fan and a utah fan so uh this is awkward.
anaheimducks,lxkoc3i,2024-11-17 05:15:46,First and foremost because of Teemu he's a national hero. I spent a couple of years in SoCal while I wasn't really a fan of any team. A local Coyotes fan took us to see some pre-season games back in 2010. Kings fans at Staples seemed like complete asses (small sample size though) and the arena in Anaheim felt more welcoming. Also actually finally seeing Teemu play live was magical. Been a Ducks fan ever since. Too bad I missed 07.
anaheimducks,lxlgalo,2024-11-17 09:24:16,There's always room for more! But as someone who visits Salt Lake often Utah is excited for hockey and the owner seems great. Might be worth keeping up with the franchise and players/prospects you might already be attached to they have potential to be a lot more exciting than the Coyotes were
anaheimducks,lxlv7ej,2024-11-17 10:55:01,I'm one of those childhood fans thanks to the movies I never really had a method to watch games until last year but I follow heavily now.
anaheimducks,lxm37jb,2024-11-17 11:39:28,You are not disloyal for ditching the coyotes. You didn’t leave the coyotes the coyotes left you.If I were you I think it would be so nice to have my own favorite out of market team that’s just on Hulu while watching Utah and Vegas compete for the scraps of the former fan base on channel 61.The biggest thing you need to know is that we’re not expected to be good until after the owners and the city complete a large renovation to the area around the arena. Beyond that who knows? You are welcome here along with all new fans.
anaheimducks,lxmbays,2024-11-17 12:24:15,"Been a fan since our 98 or 99 when I went to my first day after being a ""hockey fan"" due to the Mighty Ducks movies."
anaheimducks,lxmcoaf,2024-11-17 12:31:53,There was this cartoon about hockey playing superhero space ducks. Around 2002/03 was when I learned the Mighty Ducks were a real team and I've been a fan ever since. Also I'm British and they're one of the furthest teams away  Wasn't able to go see them when they came to London but I got a second chance and finally caught my first in-person Ducks game at Stockholm in 2011. Hoping to make it out to the Pond one day!
anaheimducks,lxmmtjv,2024-11-17 13:27:11,Saw my first Ducks game in 1992 when they were still District 5 as well.  Got me into hockey and been a fan ever since.  Welcome to the fandom.  Still have yet to see a game in person in California but I do see them when they come to the big MO so don't know about traditions.
anaheimducks,lxng09a,2024-11-17 16:01:58,![gif](giphy|ToMjGpqrlNFdSWscdzO)Yes welcome!
anaheimducks,lxnjo9u,2024-11-17 16:21:44,Orange County native. First live sports game I went to was a Ducks game. The ducks fans was electric and the ducks won. This was the 2013-2014 season when they were contendersAlso feel free to join us! We know what it's like to be a fellow small hockey fanbase located in a hot weather market and we both hate the Kings!If the Ducks relocate Im sure as hell ain't gonna be a Ducks fan anymore. Your team relocating is the best reason to ditch them for a new team.
anaheimducks,lxpkqaj,2024-11-17 23:45:42,Born and raised in Southern California.  Had been a Kings fan as a kid but some fans used to say I hadn’t been a fan long enough… I had liked the Anaheim teams mostly because it was close to home and I loved Disneyland.  Then Disney created a team that was going to start my Graduation year (93)?  Oh I was so in.  No telling me I was some newbie fan just because I wasn’t OLD enough to like them longer I was going to be a day 0 fan.  And I’ve been a loyal fan ever since.  Good times and bad.Welcome to the fandom.  You’re already used to a team being bad so only way to go from here is up when our rebuild bears fruit!
anaheimducks,lxsa1g1,2024-11-18 12:25:45,Family has never been big on sports growing up so I was late to the party. Never knew the ducks were a real team until 06-08 time frame playing NHL at a friend's place on their Xbox. Anaheim was the first team to show up since it was alphabetical. Just remember playing as the Niedermayers and have been a Scott Niedermayer fan ever since along with Perry.
anaheimducks,lxjvdop,2024-11-17 00:23:29,Also been a fan since Coach Bombay. Quack! Quack! Quack!
anaheimducks,lxlz7n9,2024-11-17 11:17:30,born in southern california but this is definitely my correct answer. i miss that team...

anaheimducks,lxlzjei,2024-11-17 11:19:19,Yes this is the way.
anaheimducks,lxjosr5,2024-11-16 23:31:14,Anyone GB natives hit me up!
anaheimducks,lxk47x3,2024-11-17 01:39:18,Shit tier banter. Please continue.
anaheimducks,lxi63cl,2024-11-16 17:37:37,The fanatics premium is the exact same jersey as the adidas premium just no dimples. Has the “full” logo (not a flat one like the breakaway) fight strap better materials more like the one they use on the ice. It’s a noticeable difference imo.
anaheimducks,lxidp86,2024-11-16 18:23:56,I have the premium. I had to size up by 1. I thought I just got fatter but from talking to a few people the premium do fit a tad smaller.
anaheimducks,lxi61nk,2024-11-16 17:37:21,Fanatics breakaway aren't worth owning. They're garbage mixed with trash. The other 2 tiers are substantially better.
anaheimducks,lxi8oxt,2024-11-16 17:52:49,I have an away premium it’s very nice.
anaheimducks,lxm3fyb,2024-11-17 11:40:45,The breakaway for the new jersey is fine. I used to swear them off because of the shitty flat crest but I can tell you for a fact that the new jersey and the 3rd from last year are 3d crests.If you can get a breakaway with a name for $120 I’d say it’s worth it at that price. Otherwise I’d go premium.Use a discount code extension to find a discount code that works on the website you use. I just use Edge because it has one built in that’s been way more reliable than other extensions.
anaheimducks,lxo8uic,2024-11-17 18:43:57,The breakaways have had textured logos the last couple years and I find them more comfortable than the premium but there's something cool about having a fight strap.
anaheimducks,lxm2exy,2024-11-17 11:35:05,Fanatics did away with the flat crest I think. My dad got the new breakaway jersey on sale for dirt cheap at Dicks with a name and number. Overall it was actually pretty nice. And for the price he paid I’d go that route if I hadn’t already bought a premium. I did buy a breakaway 3rd from last year and actually liked the quality of that too for $120 with a name and number. No flat crest on that either.
anaheimducks,lxih401,2024-11-16 18:45:21,So I normally wear a 52 as I'm a men's large maybe recommended going 54?
anaheimducks,lxj296e,2024-11-16 20:56:58,Did you get a home premium?
anaheimducks,lxo99iz,2024-11-17 18:46:22,Do they have anyone other than Z yet?
anaheimducks,lxihjs8,2024-11-16 18:48:05,Yeah. I'm normally 54 and I went with a 56.
anaheimducks,lxje5zq,2024-11-16 22:15:56,If buying a home Orange one I would size up. My home 52 measured out to 50.  Had no issue with away 50 fits as it should.
anaheimducks,lxjczjw,2024-11-16 22:08:03,Yeah
anaheimducks,lxin8n1,2024-11-16 19:23:04,Oh great. I already squeeze into a 60 lol can’t they make them for monsters?
anaheimducks,lxjdr9y,2024-11-16 22:13:14,The reason I ask is I heard a few others say the home ones run almost size smaller than tagged.Some I had to exchange my size 50 home for a 52 as the 50 measured out closer to a 46. When I overlay the home 52 over my away size 50 they match. Typical Indonesia sizing variation on the home one IMO.
anaheimducks,lxip6nm,2024-11-16 19:35:01,Is 60 the biggest they make?
anaheimducks,lxgldjp,2024-11-16 12:29:50,NHL are the majors and AHL are the minors. Anaheim’s “farm” team would be the San Diego Gulls.I’m about to sit down for breakfast but I’m sure others will chime in with a lot more in depth information.
anaheimducks,lxgm36e,2024-11-16 12:33:37,Our minor league teams are the san diego gulls in the ahl and the tusla oilers of the echl. Teams in the chl(an umbrella league for the ohl whl and qmjhl) have prospects who play for them for a year or 2 even after being drafted because its good development playing against players their age. Its a different strategy but it allows 17 or 18 year olds thw chance to not immediately get thrown into the fire against 25 to 35 year old grown men in the minor leagues here who usually have to be super vicious and aggressive to get called up
anaheimducks,lxgllk1,2024-11-16 12:31:01,Yes it’s called the AHL. Our feeder team is the San Diego Gulls. You’ll hear them talk about recalling players. They are being recalled from the Gulls.
anaheimducks,lxgxv11,2024-11-16 13:35:55,MLB: NHLAAA: AHLAA: ECHLNCAA/OHL/CHL/WHL are all considered amateur so closer to college baseball players getting drafted
anaheimducks,lxgzkvh,2024-11-16 13:45:04,As the others have said the ECHL is like double A.NHL>AHL>ECHL kind of mirror MLB>AAA>AA.In hockey there isn’t affiliated teams below the ECHL. There are juniors leagues (OHLQMJHLWHL) that are specifically for young players/prospects that are eligible to be drafted or were just recently drafted (I believe the upper age cutoff for juniors is 20).The juniors leagues are separate from the NHL so they have broad agreements between the leagues on how the players can be drafted/enter the NHL when they technically still have contracts with juniors teams.The reason Sennecke specifically is still in juniors is because one of these agreements is that juniors players cannot be pulled out of their juniors league team unless they are being placed on the NHL roster they can’t be rostered to a lower affiliate team in the AHL or ECHL. Sennecke either has to wait out the next year and a half in juniors until his age 21 season or make the Ducks team directly at the beginning of the season.
anaheimducks,lxh3bdo,2024-11-16 14:04:58,Take a look at a few players career tracks through Wikipedia and eliteprospects.You can see Sennecke played AAA level hockey as a kid. Then when he was 16 he was drafted into the OHL which is a development league for 16-20 year olds also known as Major Junior. When he was 18 he was drafted by the Ducks. From there it’s ultimately the Ducks management’s decision to keep him in the OHL or transition him to pro (NHL/AHL/ECHL). Typically players will continue to play in Junior to continue developing. This usually benefits them because while working on getting better themselves they’re also playing against other 16-20 year olds who are also in the same struggle to get stronger faster and smarter. Sending an undersized and underdeveloped player to the pros(especially AHL/ECHL) would expose them to full grown men and literal giants who have all the incentive to take some scrawny kids head off to prove himself in order to make his way up to the big club(NHL).
anaheimducks,lximlz1,2024-11-16 19:19:10,NHL is the top league.AHL is the main feeder league.ECHL is the next tier down. It's still pro (as in they get paid but not much). It's pretty rare for players to make the jump from ECHL to NHL but it happens.These are the 3 pro leagues.Then you have the OHL WHL and QMJHL. These are three development (non-pro) leagues mostly in Canada (there's a few American teams). These collectively are known as the CHL.Then you have the USHL which is the US equivalent of the CHL. America also has the NCAA route which will be picking up steam in the coming years.
anaheimducks,lxgli3x,2024-11-16 12:30:30,So why is Sennecke playing for the Ottawa Generals?
anaheimducks,lxgn3cy,2024-11-16 12:38:58,That makes sense. I was wondering with how physical of a sport this can be how guys that are 17-18 could actually go up against grown men in a physical way. Like Z is by no means huge but he seems to be at least be physically where he needs to be.So is Leo as a 19 year old sort of an anomaly? It seems like some of these Swedish guys get put in a lot faster
anaheimducks,lxglqts,2024-11-16 12:31:47,But Sennecke plays for the General? So the ECHL must just be like a bottom league then
anaheimducks,lxgm5v0,2024-11-16 12:34:01,"The OHL WHL QMJH etc are all forms of lower level ""juniors"". Think of them like unaffiliated AA or single A teams playing competitive games and focused on development but with guys that have their ""professional"" rights owned by an NHL team"
anaheimducks,lxgncf1,2024-11-16 12:40:18,Oshawa Generals\*
anaheimducks,lxh0ofo,2024-11-16 13:50:55,There are requirements that have to be met with the Canadian leagues after a player from there has been drafted to an nhl team.  Years played or age until they can play in the ahl.
anaheimducks,lxind17,2024-11-16 19:23:49,Because when a kid is drafted from the CHL at 18 they can't go straight to the AHL. They either make the NHL roster or have to be sent back to juniors. This is due to an agreement between the NHL and CHL in order to keep CHL leagues exciting and with flashy talent.They can jump to the AHL at a certain point I think 20 years old or after a couple years still in juniors after the draft.Kids drafted from American routes (USHL NCAA) don't have this same stipulation and can be sent to the AHL at 18. Sometimes kids on good NCAA teams will stay there as opposed to go to the AHL (if they don't make the NHL roster right away) as it may be better for their development given their younger age and maybe smaller stature compared to the AHL.
anaheimducks,lxgprj5,2024-11-16 12:53:04,Sweden and Europe overall work a bit differently. Take Lucas Pettersson our 2nd round pick last draft. He started the year in the J20 (Highest Junior league in Sweden) and did very well so his team called him up to play for the Men’s team in the SHL (highest division). That team (MoDo) is not very good so instead of sending Pettersson back to dominate the Junior league they loaned him to a 2nd division team where the level of play is not as high and Pettersson can be given more playing time. After that loan spell was over he’s back with the SHL team. While it’s not been going great statistically so far the fact his team is giving him around 12 minutes per game is a good show that they feel he is ready to play vs men be it with them or perhaps on loan to a lower division. For context Leo was playing vs men since he was 16 so when we drafted him he already had played vs men in the top league of Sweden for 2 years at that point. But yes you are correct it is very rare for players to play in the NHL immediately after they are drafted only 1-3 per year roughly.The reason we don’t see this in North America is that prospects from the Canadian leagues can’t play in the AHL or ECHL until they are (20? I think it was that might be wrong there). So either you have a player who is good enough to keep in the NHL or you send them back to their junior league to get better. To play in the NCAA you can’t have a contract with an NHL team so again either they stay in the NCAA or they sign and play with you. The NCAA route does allow a player to play in the AHL too but most teams tend to keep their players in the NCAA as it is a good development league and the AHL can be quite vicious for young players.   Ask away if you got any more questions.
anaheimducks,lxgodn6,2024-11-16 12:45:44,Leo didnt play consistently last year he missed time due to injury but when he wasnt injured he'd sometimes be a healthy scratch to ease him into the long haul of the season. Its not that abnormal for top 5 picks to start playing in the nhl immediately after being drafted. It really depends on the player and his specific situation but you saw that last year that bedard and fantilli also started playing right away and youre seeing it this year with celebrini.
anaheimducks,lxh23b4,2024-11-16 13:58:26,Leo last year had some injuries and in a collaboration with GMPV and his agent took games off here and there for his development. Plus in Sweden I believe before he got drafted he was playing in the SHL (top league in sweden)
anaheimducks,lxgou4o,2024-11-16 12:48:10,The way I understand is that Swedish leagues are a bit higher level than Canadian Junior leagues so Leo is playing appropriately while Beckett is still developing his style even though he's been drafted. It isn't rare for young players to be playing NHL but it also isn't super common.
anaheimducks,lxgn9ub,2024-11-16 12:39:56,ECHL is like Double A. The Ducks affiliate is the Tulsa Oilers
anaheimducks,lxh83z7,2024-11-16 14:30:34,OHL is a Canadian league that's why you are getting confused.  Hockey is pretty much shared between Canada and USA at the junior level where there are a lot of junior leagues players can play for before getting into pro hockey (AHL & NHL).
anaheimducks,lxgmmt6,2024-11-16 12:36:32,Interesting… thank you for the context. I didn’t realize there were so many leagues. Feels very unique to have like a right affiliated player. I guess wasn’t that the think with Cutter being a flier who was still playing in college or something? I’m just getting use to the team set up our rotations so I’m trying to branch out and understand all that the team has.
anaheimducks,lxh65d5,2024-11-16 14:20:06,I don't think that's really a great comparison because players aren't drafted from AA or A teams in baseball.
anaheimducks,lxgnfw1,2024-11-16 12:40:48,Thank you lol.
anaheimducks,lxgqva5,2024-11-16 12:58:51,No all this makes sense. It is interesting to hear you can put players out on loan like the do in the European soccer leagues. Sounds like there are other country restrictions that prevent every young player from being treated the exact same which I’m familiar with from a soccer league perspective.Part of this is me clearly underestimating Hockey as a more global sport. Being from Florida new to hockey the media and infrastructure part doesn’t seem nearly as developed as the NBA or the NFL but that’s clearly not because of a lack of players interested in participating. This has been great to recalibrate my understanding. Like I said I just could not understand why our 3rd round pick wasn’t playing in what I thought were the related development teams so it sounds like there are a ton more options for teams to choose how they develop talent.I guess the last think would be so like do NHL teams technically have upwards 80+ players at their disposal across the various leagues? Think 20x3 for the related American leagues + development players playing in the Jr leagues. There are just a ton of players out there.
anaheimducks,lxgnxax,2024-11-16 12:43:19,Rights unaffiliated players are either:  A.) too young for the NHL draft (juniors players can be like 16 years old I think)   orB:) not really developed enough or good enough to get drafted
anaheimducks,lxgu2f4,2024-11-16 13:15:55,Good question. You can check on Elite Prospects website under a team's page how many players they have under contract (The Depth Chart page) and how many they have exclusive signing rights to. Unless I can't count I think the total amount of players the Ducks have under contract and exclusive rights to is 62 at the moment.If we have a player under contract we have them for how many years the contract is (it can be longer but no need to make this difficult). If a player is un-signed then we hold the exclusive rights to sign them for a certain time. That time depends on what league we drafted them out of and how old they are. For now there is no agreement with Russia so any player that is drafted out of Russia will be kept as a team's exclusive signing right forever until they trade that right or sign the player.
anaheimducks,lxele77,2024-11-16 03:27:31,Zegras was on one tonight. Loved it!!

anaheimducks,lxl9rv5,2024-11-17 08:38:17,Great move
anaheimducks,lxfxsy3,2024-11-16 10:20:19,I’d be pissed too if I was voted the most overrated player in the NHL
anaheimducks,lxgc979,2024-11-16 11:40:41,gotta be more consistent though
anaheimducks,lxfq04n,2024-11-16 09:32:17,Noticed that. Was he unhappy because they were still down at that point and happier when Cutter got his first and the lead?
anaheimducks,lxgm25o,2024-11-16 12:33:27,"The way Zegras handled himself after that goal was ice cold. To me it was a ""jobs not done boys"" response. He was locked in and mean all night. He was beyond noticeable all night. Great to see him and the boys get rewarded."
anaheimducks,lxfk372,2024-11-16 08:53:01,Makes me sad. Was good see him hyped up when cutter got his goal though
anaheimducks,lxexodd,2024-11-16 05:42:59,Saw that
anaheimducks,lxfx8jh,2024-11-16 10:16:59,Still 0 Michigan attempts in the season. Something is seriously wrong right? Ducks need to hold an intervention
anaheimducks,lxf1o0i,2024-11-16 06:22:49,Saw that too it’s like his spirit is crushed.
anaheimducks,lxjott6,2024-11-16 23:31:27,
anaheimducks,lxgcbmi,2024-11-16 11:41:04,Agreed
anaheimducks,lxhyv01,2024-11-16 16:56:40,I would say it’s probably because of where we are in the standings it’s pretty clear how much z hates losing
anaheimducks,lxnb1sm,2024-11-17 15:36:09,Literally this and that’s a good thing. Terry had a similar expression. Then once the ducks got the lead and won everyone was smiling.
anaheimducks,lxgk996,2024-11-16 12:23:52,Genuinely seeing beind the net and the best play (in my opinion) is actually to Michigan because he has no passing options and isn't being defended himself and seeing him skate it out is one of the saddest things to watch
anaheimducks,lxmdsxe,2024-11-17 12:38:08,Hoping that’s channeled to improving the team to win more

anaheimducks,lxe4uw7,2024-11-16 00:47:26,Zellweger playing with shades of vintage Niedermayer.He's taken big strides in production performance work ethic and communication. Think he should be on the fast track to alternate captain or captaincy.
anaheimducks,lxe3xey,2024-11-16 00:40:13,Red Wings really let Ross Johnston score LMAO
anaheimducks,lxe4gvv,2024-11-16 00:44:25,I love Mint and Luneau but I really think Zellweger is our next franchise guy on the backend. Kid is special. What a game from him tonight.
anaheimducks,lxe4j7p,2024-11-16 00:44:56,Such a big win. Comeback Cutter's 1st Zegras goal successful power plays and more. All in front of a good Friday night crowd and of course its always sweet to beat the Wings. Fun stuff.
anaheimducks,lxe404v,2024-11-16 00:40:49,So that was fun. Felt like most the guys got involved. Happy Z felt good on defense and offensive. Zellwiger is awesome! Dude was so impactful! Also happy to see cutter get his goal to break out.
anaheimducks,lxe4fj3,2024-11-16 00:44:08,Get fucked Detroit

anaheimducks,lxe4era,2024-11-16 00:43:58,has to be cutter just for finally getting his first goal. zelle will have more games like this.
anaheimducks,lxe6iru,2024-11-16 01:00:35,I would've never said his prior to this season but maybe you're onto something. Kid lives at the rink/gym and is legit leader material.

anaheimducks,lxe6ci4,2024-11-16 00:59:13,Yeah when you allow Ross Johnston to find enough time and space for a clean deflection scoring maybe one of the night's nicest goals ya gotta check yourself.Good for that line though great hustle by Harkins to set up the shot and awesome finish by Johnston.

anaheimducks,lxeklux,2024-11-16 03:18:46,I wasn't impressed with his first few games. Lots of turnovers. But he seemingly flipped a switch and has since been (in my opinion) the best defenseman on the team. He's got the smarts for a long NHL career since this kind of learning and growth is what sets apart good players and great players.
anaheimducks,lxe8km6,2024-11-16 01:17:38,I can’t believe I watched that trash and missed the best parts of this game 
anaheimducks,lxi011w,2024-11-16 17:03:08,Nah it was just a money grab between an old guy with no legs and a guy less than half his age with a 5 inch reach advantage. I genuinely thought they might have rigged it to be a draw but… if someone was going to win it was either Mike in the first round or exactly what we saw. Luckily the undercard was so good
anaheimducks,lxe59tm,2024-11-16 00:50:40,I thought Cutter was excellent even without his goal. He's been so good on the forth line somehow!
anaheimducks,lxe8447,2024-11-16 01:13:43,No doubt! I just think Zell has the it factor
anaheimducks,lxe5jbv,2024-11-16 00:52:44,Yup too bad we play the stars on Monday though lol.

anaheimducks,lxfksmw,2024-11-16 08:57:52,His goal really energized the entire team. The team needed that goal from him.  And then to immediately get a pretty goal from Ross Johnston 38 seconds later.   
anaheimducks,lxe844k,2024-11-16 01:13:43,They don’t ask how! Shot with speed puck on net congratulations

winnipegjets,lxtrowz,2024-11-18 16:55:55,I wish him great health and success for the remainder of his career. A very long career.
winnipegjets,lxtr8ua,2024-11-18 16:53:39,This was expected. He needs some games to get his legs. He’s also waiver eligible so this is time limited to 3 games or 7 days though I might have that a little wrong and the smarter heads can tell me if I’m wrong.

winnipegjets,lxtydhv,2024-11-18 17:31:14,At this point I would be pleasantly surprised if he were an everyday nhl regular. Between him and Lucius combined I think they’ve played a full season over the past two years.
winnipegjets,lxu5ql1,2024-11-18 18:11:55,I also wish upon him a Norris and 80 points
winnipegjets,lxtvxxr,2024-11-18 17:18:11,5 games or two weeks whichever comes first I believe.
winnipegjets,lxu6hiz,2024-11-18 18:16:14,Ville has played 35 NHL games since 2019-20. He played 0 last year and 10 the year before. He's played 149 AHL games since 2019-20. He played 41 last year and 48 the year before. Not a lot of pro hockey for our boy.
winnipegjets,lxtw3oy,2024-11-18 17:19:03,I swore it was less but I’m happy to have the answer. Also that fits well with the Jets road trip and the Moose schedule.

winnipegjets,lxso0ih,2024-11-18 13:35:45,They're 15-3. I'm not even close to hitting the panic button.
winnipegjets,lxtdojh,2024-11-18 15:45:22,"To me tomorrow nights game against Florida is going to say a lot about our team. I understand the loss last game. Adam Lowry made a Freudian slip by saying that the team was ""surprised"" by how well Florida played in a practice day interview. He corrected himself but we all saw how quickly the Panthers began to dominate. Now  that the guys have seen the level of play needed to be the Stanley Cup Champions I fully expect the them to rise to the occasion. Go Jets Go!!!"

winnipegjets,lxsgbe9,2024-11-18 12:57:02,What’s up with Chaz Lucius. Looks like he’s only played 3 games for the Moose. I know they were doing ice management with this season but seems that’s he’s been out a little long.
winnipegjets,lxte8ss,2024-11-18 15:48:13,Whoops. Fixed. Thank you for catching that.And thank you for the kind words.
winnipegjets,lxst6bx,2024-11-18 14:01:31,He missed the last two at home against the Admirals which was curious (as he had been splitting games) and then he didn't practice. Coach didn't say there was a setback just that he wasn't certain if he'd come on road trip.  I'm gonna be at practice tomorrow or Wednesday to find out.
winnipegjets,lxste8i,2024-11-18 14:02:38,Thanks

winnipegjets,lxs58nb,2024-11-18 12:01:27,City is real quiet today.Sure sucks losing three in a row but some bomber fans never got to see us win one let alone two back to back. I think it's easy to forget the 3-15 5-15 4-14 seasons. Team is ready for a big overhaul this season and there's one league you can get it done in the offseason its the CFL.   Jets better come out THUMPING tomorrow night.
winnipegjets,lxr7gwc,2024-11-18 08:52:58,One noticeable aspect of the recent losses was on the defensive side. In previous games such as the Colorado one the defenders would take options away. Sticks in lanes stick on stick action (hot) would allow Helle to make the first save. Last game it was apparent the defense took a vacation.I've said it before and I'll continue saying it but I'm looking forward to seeing how they respond after the last two stinkers.
winnipegjets,lxrwdyo,2024-11-18 11:16:08,Dearest JertsI have noticed your play has become quite Jerty as of late. Please stop that non-sense.Thank-you and best regardsMine-Shaft-Gap.

winnipegjets,lxsk5q9,2024-11-18 13:16:27,5 straight in a league with as high of turnover as the CFL is very impressive imo
winnipegjets,lxs02b4,2024-11-18 11:35:14,That's the problem with sports the pain of losing often outweighs the joy of winning especially in the short term.Some day we'll look back at this era of the Bombers and be happy about it losses notwithstanding. Even if it doesn't feel that way the day after the latest Grey Cup loss.
winnipegjets,lxsut1g,2024-11-18 14:09:43,hopefully Ville is good to go here’s his shot to get 3-4 games in

winnipegjets,lxm9tdm,2024-11-17 12:15:59,Joke league.
winnipegjets,lxmdebl,2024-11-17 12:35:53,https://youtu.be/2CfdAeS9bEcThis league is turning into a joke. Slow the hit down the point of contact was ABOVE THE KNEES
winnipegjets,lxmt824,2024-11-17 14:00:24,Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t kucherov get no penalty or fine for hitting KC from behind? What a joke player safety is
winnipegjets,lxmakn6,2024-11-17 12:20:13,Lol wtf
winnipegjets,lxml9lb,2024-11-17 13:18:54,I'm confused. I didn't see anything at or below the knees.  Rule 44 - Clipping 44.1 Clipping - Clipping is the act of throwing the body across or below the  knees of an opponent from any direction.  A player may not deliver a check in a “clipping” manner nor lower  his own body position to deliver a check on or below an opponent’s  knees.  An illegal “low hit” is a check that is delivered by a player who may  or may not have both skates on the ice with his sole intent to check  the opponent in the area of his knees. A player may not lower his  body position to deliver a check to an opponent’s knees.  44.2 Minor Penalty - A player who commits these infractions will be  assessed a minor penalty for “clipping.”  44.3 Major Penalty - If an injury occurs as a result of this “clipping” check  the player must be assessed a major penalty (see 44.5). 44.4 Match Penalty - The Referee at his discretion may assess a match  penalty if in his judgment the player attempted to or deliberately  injured his opponent by clipping.  44.5 Game Misconduct Penalty - A game misconduct penalty must be  assessed anytime a major penalty is applied for injuring an opponent  by clipping.  44.6 Fines and Suspensions – Refer to Rule 23.6 – Fines and  Suspensions – Physical Infractions Category. There are no specified fines or suspensions for clipping however  supplementary discipline can be applied by the Commissioner at his  discretion (refer to Rule 28).Oof sorry for the formatting. Copy and paste on mobile is not my friend here.
winnipegjets,lxmpfc4,2024-11-17 13:40:44,Solid hip check. NHL is so inconsistent.
winnipegjets,lxm5gj9,2024-11-17 11:51:48,Ok
winnipegjets,lxmxacs,2024-11-17 14:21:33,Even for a league widely recognized for officiating that would make a soccer referee blush Saturday was a new low. The calls on the ice in several of the games and this Player Safety farce prove that if Bettman even gives a shit about anything other than gambling revenue anymore he’s incapable of maintaining the quality of the product.
winnipegjets,lxmbcww,2024-11-17 12:24:33,Bullshit. I'm sending him a donation.
winnipegjets,lxmj6rg,2024-11-17 13:07:45,Had no idea that department still did things. Huh. 
winnipegjets,lxmh2v4,2024-11-17 12:56:14,The gyatt attack
winnipegjets,lxmj1xp,2024-11-17 13:07:01,Pionk was traded to the Jets from the NY Rangers so the Rangers were fined $250000
winnipegjets,lxmxae1,2024-11-17 14:21:34,I remember a couple of good hip checks this season and thought they were allowing them again but they threw Pionk under the bus for an example not to do them again. Hip checks are awesome when done right. It’s just if done slightly too low they can destroy all the tendons in a knee. It’s bs bc it’s the jets but it was inevitable they’d make another example because hip checks were never going to be allowed again
winnipegjets,lxpduvq,2024-11-17 22:56:27,Jets fan in winnipeg.  I hate to say it but looking at the replay (seeing it for the first time now listened to the game on the radio) looks like P’s hip point of contact was the knee on the reverse angle slo-mo.  Hope it doesn’t change his approach cause I love all the hip checks he’s delivered otherwise.  Glad only  fine.
winnipegjets,lxn6c46,2024-11-17 15:10:47,Bettman hate the Jets. Can’t have them be successful in any way. This influences this decision.
winnipegjets,lxn52pm,2024-11-17 15:03:57,Personally when I saw this all I could think of were lack of neck guards and that accident last year
winnipegjets,lxpojhc,2024-11-18 00:15:06,Can't say i disagree.
winnipegjets,lxmcg1r,2024-11-17 12:30:36,Idk what everyone is on about. Definitely dirty. If that was ehlers or Connor we'd be trying to sink Florida into the sea.
winnipegjets,lxnkvr9,2024-11-17 16:28:20,Exactly. I'm never sure what to do with posts like this that are informative so a thumbs up but piss me off so thumbs down. I don't care what 185 lb Neil Pionk does vs almost always larger opponents. Good on you Neil for making guys keep their heads up out there with good ol' fashioned CLEAN hip checks.
winnipegjets,lxmfqjl,2024-11-17 12:48:53,Paros and his squad of goomba clowns are useless along with the Goalie Interference decision crew and the NHL schedule/start time makers.  Lots of clowns employed by the NHL.
winnipegjets,lxo1qpg,2024-11-17 18:02:17,I saw a photo of nurse after his visor is bloody and he's got a pretty blank stare. That hit was ugly as fuck. Course leafs fans are defending it.
winnipegjets,lxnjcic,2024-11-17 16:19:55,Reaves got 5 games
winnipegjets,lxmlr6f,2024-11-17 13:21:31,I hate how reverse hits are considered legal when they are by definition interference.
winnipegjets,lxmfsrf,2024-11-17 12:49:14,They were both perfectly fine.
winnipegjets,lxmsk95,2024-11-17 13:56:59,I was actually thinking there might be a fine for Vlad's retaliation when Bobqvists was on the ice
winnipegjets,lxmeibm,2024-11-17 12:42:04,ya i don’t think you can go low on someone who you are moving forward and towardship checks are different because you’re moving with the player and backwards this makes sense to me if he didn’t bend over so much there probably wouldn’t be any issue with the hit
winnipegjets,lxmq4l2,2024-11-17 13:44:15,It doesn’t make sense to me either.  The dude getting reverse hit doesn’t have the puck!
winnipegjets,lxnm9ow,2024-11-17 16:35:57,Absolutely they are and they're dirty AF unless you're about to be hit from behind so hard by a bigger opponent that you fear becoming part of the boards and then it's just a lean back for protection. These are aggressive interference calls that often turn into hits to the head that need to be called. I think they should be viewed as one of those throw down moves that can warrant an automatic fight or teammates jumping in like happens with hits from behind.
winnipegjets,lxo44ib,2024-11-17 18:16:14,I can understand it being legal when someone goes for a hit but gets reversed but just blowing a guy up when he doesn’t have the puck is textbook interference
winnipegjets,lxmkdli,2024-11-17 13:14:10,Yep. It’s that he was low enough to take out the legs. A little higher or more of a traditional hipper and he would’ve been fine. Really though I saw this same hit from maybe Bennet? In the playoffs and zero repercussions so…
winnipegjets,lxlzomy,2024-11-17 11:20:08,Unfortunately that 18-0 doesn't include the important 5 against Colorado last spring where it truly matters.I like fun stats but let's keep things real. As good as things are going we still need to reach a new level if we're going to have any success in the playoffs. Enjoy the ride - let's see what kind of stats we can show by the end of the season
winnipegjets,lxlq0xo,2024-11-17 10:25:04,The Atlantic division curse is a real thing. At least it’s likely the Jets will make the finals at this rate

winnipegjets,lxn3uww,2024-11-17 14:57:14,Not a curse the eastern conference is actually good. Sens sand Sabre's would probably be top of the standings in the west
winnipegjets,lxtxu6v,2024-11-18 17:28:22,Who is “they”?  I just came up with the streak parameters and to state “regular season games” generates a wild streak.
winnipegjets,lxk224k,2024-11-17 01:20:17,Who made these schedules? Weird giving the Jets alot of day offs. Our last game was like November 12 and the next one is November 19? Ffs.Anyway Go Bombers!

winnipegjets,lxpd8h7,2024-11-17 22:52:09,Bombers thanking their lucky stars they won in 2019 and 2021. Three final losses in a row would be remembered as an all-time choke otherwise.
winnipegjets,lxoob5i,2024-11-17 20:14:33,Uninspiring first half from the Bombers offence is completely flat Zach underthrows are all over the place thank god the defence can tackle properly tonight (so far)
winnipegjets,lxp60ld,2024-11-17 22:04:11,Oof…maybe the Jets loss wasn’t that bad after all
winnipegjets,lxp43j2,2024-11-17 21:51:56,I'm glad I didn't order wings and stuff. What a crappy game.
winnipegjets,lxp7706,2024-11-17 22:11:47, Bombers coaching making a good case for letting the AI overlords take over.

winnipegjets,lxmmtxk,2024-11-17 13:27:14,Google translate statement from Linkoping:> This is a mutual decision from all parties. Fabian himself feels he wants to go over and give games in North America a chance while we have not been able to give him the playing time and confidence he needs to take the next step here. While we think it’s sad that we didn’t get more out of each other we part ways in a good way and of course wish Fabian the best of luck on the other side of the Atlantic says the men’s team’s sporting director Peter Jakobsson[https://www.lhc.eu/article/77wasmw-30c01/view](https://www.lhc.eu/article/77wasmw-30c01/view)
winnipegjets,lxmi7ne,2024-11-17 13:02:27,I agree excellent. I was wondering if this was coming. Fabian started the year as a regular but has been routinely healthy scratched or dressed as the 13th forward (in Sweden you can dress 20 skaters) and would play maybe 3-4 minutes a game. He needs to play regularly especially because the clock has started on his ELC.
winnipegjets,lxk3bwq,2024-11-17 01:31:22,hopefully the highlight of winnipeg sports this weekend

winnipegjets,lxmaq5l,2024-11-17 12:21:04,The losses were disappointing but damn this team has me pumped. The sports media can all suck it. This team has what it takes. I can feel it in my bones.
winnipegjets,lxp3yzx,2024-11-17 21:51:09,Under? I wasn’t even aware he was in the game at all
winnipegjets,lxp5kdv,2024-11-17 22:01:17,Putting his resume on Indeed hopefully
winnipegjets,lxnsr15,2024-11-17 17:11:29,Wait what were the actions??
winnipegjets,lxowbrk,2024-11-17 21:03:47,I wish the Bombers could have been the underdogs no pressure.
winnipegjets,lxpptgr,2024-11-18 00:25:42,Collaros with 0 TDs and 6 INTs in the last 3 grey cups is unfathomably bad. Without those first 2 cups he'd be run out of town for the last 3 performances.
winnipegjets,lxpjyz3,2024-11-17 23:40:08,It still is an all time choke. Was at the game other than Willie no one came to play. Brady might’ve but didn’t get the ball enough. Collaros was awful. Argos dominated the game.
winnipegjets,lxp303x,2024-11-17 21:45:12,I've never been able to get into it. I think the pace of football just isn't for me. I only pay attention to the nfl because of fantasy football too

I can't just follow a team in any sport because I am from said place or have ties to said place I actually have to enjoy the sport and yeah football doesn't do it for me I love hockey though and can watch any team play.

winnipegjets,lxothr0,2024-11-17 20:46:22,silly downvotes — I also don’t care but I live outside the prairies and CFL isn’t as big here. I love the dynasty as a piece of info but I don’t follow it and nobody I know does so
winnipegjets,lxp4b9n,2024-11-17 21:53:17,Yea cause they refused to run the ball. Collaros looking to set the record for most 4th quarter interceptions. Oliveira only guy moving the ball.8 carries 80 yards. Averaged 10 yards a carry but stopped using him.
winnipegjets,lxo4ik6,2024-11-17 18:18:32,Third man in.
winnipegjets,lxpq9u1,2024-11-18 00:29:34,I truly think this is the end of the road for him that was an all time stinker for a guy going into the final year of his contract
winnipegjets,lxp4pvv,2024-11-17 21:55:52,Pierce needs to be let go during the post game presser.
winnipegjets,lxprzxm,2024-11-18 00:44:31,And he'll be 37 next season. Very mid 17/15 TD to INT ratio this year and that included a 6 TD game to get there and only had 2 multi TD games all season. 
winnipegjets,lxj9ih2,2024-11-16 21:44:52,Adversity in the regular season is a good thing!
winnipegjets,lxj9imu,2024-11-16 21:44:54,Panthers shut down our game plan and the Jets played pretty poorly but you can't say they didn't care.  Sucks to lose but the 79-3-0 dream is still on!
winnipegjets,lxja6qw,2024-11-16 21:49:21,Can't they lose like 3-2 or something?
winnipegjets,lxj9g0o,2024-11-16 21:44:25,The Jets had a lot of passengers and no drivers on their lines tonight. Oh well that's how it goes sometimes hopefully the boys will bounce back for a good game at home on Tuesday!
winnipegjets,lxj9ohu,2024-11-16 21:45:59,And then cut to Leafs winning in Overtime. Just turn that blade more

winnipegjets,lxj9dhm,2024-11-16 21:43:57,Longest losing streak of the year.Hope they end it next game.
winnipegjets,lxjchq6,2024-11-16 22:04:41,"Anyone remember that guy saying ""upcoming 15-3"" because every time he goes to a Jets game the Jets lose "
winnipegjets,lxjqics,2024-11-16 23:44:35,Teams are gunning for the Jets now as a form of benchmark and are probably warned  to work or get blown away. Unfortunately over the course of the last few days the Jets have been shown once again by two recent Stanley Cup winning teams what it takes to play at that next level. If this were the playoffs we'd have again been schooled. These 3 games might be great for this team going forward and early enough that we can make it make a difference. The Panthers worked as hard as a team can work out there today were fast physical and played with an edge and the Jets were shown that as good as they have been playing this season there is another gear that they need to achieve even yet. Good lesson. Now let's use these lessons to kick some A. Go Jets Go!
winnipegjets,lxj9blh,2024-11-16 21:43:36,This team looks absolutely lost without Logan Stanley in the lineup...  1W-2L 12GA since he was put on IR
winnipegjets,lxjaksy,2024-11-16 21:51:58,https://i.redd.it/l06dq2byld1e1.gifBeen awhile since I got to bust this bad boy out
winnipegjets,lxje1u4,2024-11-16 22:15:11,I had thought that we would see what Arniel is made of when teams learn to counter our strategy.Time will tell.At least we banked 15 wins right off the hop that's really helpful.
winnipegjets,lxj9u3n,2024-11-16 21:46:59,On second thought maybe the late nights at Disney world before the games in Florida wasn’t such a great idea.
winnipegjets,lxjbdi7,2024-11-16 21:57:14,The real test is how we perform on Tuesday against them again. Want the win but if it’s a tight game that will be better than today
winnipegjets,lxjyzjb,2024-11-17 00:52:59,One goal by the Panthers got my attention and it got Arneil's attention too. I could not believe that Vilardi(and I love that guy) just went for a skate on a back check and even though it might not have been his guy who scored the goal it was Vilardi that showed up late in the defensive zone just after he shot and scored. It was half hearted at best and the goal would not have occurred if he made the play on his man in neutral ice when he had the chance. He subsequently spent the rest of the game on a different line while Ehlers got brought up to the first line. That wasn't very Jetlike by this year's standards so hopefully message sent and message received.
winnipegjets,lxj9ggi,2024-11-16 21:44:29,Next one is ours dw
winnipegjets,lxja258,2024-11-16 21:48:30,Probably a good time for the team (and some of the fans) to get a reality check that we're not just gonna coast to the playoffs
winnipegjets,lxj9d7z,2024-11-16 21:43:54,Ok15-3 start means I'm still going to take this one on the chin and move on. However we have two days off at home against the same team we just played. If we don't put up a really strong showing on Tuesday if we look anything like we have in these last two games I don't care about our start anymore things need to be shaken up.
winnipegjets,lxjuxxb,2024-11-17 00:19:48,Top 4 D with edge needed sooner than later. Rough night for the Morrissey DeMelo pairing too much puck watching.

winnipegjets,lxjp458,2024-11-16 23:33:42,Florida was unkind to our team this week. Lets hope we get one back from the Panthers on Tuesday.
winnipegjets,lxkpkmx,2024-11-17 05:29:30,Seemed like it was back and forth to start but then they ran away with it. If some of those early shots go post in and not out it may have broken the momentum enough to stay competitive. Hoping we can bounce back on Tues. 
winnipegjets,lxja1gt,2024-11-16 21:48:22,Jets just tanking not to win the presidents trophy that's all

winnipegjets,lxjbd88,2024-11-16 21:57:12,This team completely falls apart against a heavy forecheck
winnipegjets,lxjbasg,2024-11-16 21:56:44,Tuesday is a big test for Arniel's coaching. We need to adapt against this playstyle and we've got two days to do it. If we can't do that then there's not much hope we're able to do it in the playoffs.

winnipegjets,lxj9gy6,2024-11-16 21:44:35,This is why the jets aren’t going to be champions anytime soon.Once our game gets figured out we just don’t have the ability to adapt as the game goes on. We falter way too easily when the opposition has a suffocating forecheck.After playing a championship calibre team my gut feeling is that many people will be disappointed when postseason comes around.

winnipegjets,lxjg9u9,2024-11-16 22:30:07,Frauds!
winnipegjets,lxjaqds,2024-11-16 21:52:59,I gave up on that game as soon as that first 4 on 4 happened. I could tell no one (aside from maybe Ehlers) was willing to do any hard work to come up with pucks. Half the time they just let the guy skate with the puck down the wall no checking necessary. Their entire system relies on constant pressure and some nights they just think fake performative actions resembling pressure will suffice and someone else will pick up the slack.ACTUALLY overrated.
winnipegjets,lxja5zh,2024-11-16 21:49:13,This team is absolutely going to overachieve like last year. Hey as long as they're selling tickets I guess.
winnipegjets,lxjboh7,2024-11-16 21:59:16,We may have been dominated by the Panthers but at least the Leafs gave their opponents a point by going to OT. Losers.

winnipegjets,lxjdr5g,2024-11-16 22:13:12,Oh for sure.  Look at what it did for the bombers this year. Jets are a great team but you have to lose some games to keep you grounded.

winnipegjets,lxjonku,2024-11-16 23:30:08,Brutal yes and I hate to see anybody hurt but if it had to happen to somebody.....
winnipegjets,lxjlgyq,2024-11-16 23:06:11,petition to ban the guy from going to another Jets game for the rest of the season /s
winnipegjets,lxmf9fx,2024-11-17 12:46:15,I have like an .800 winning percentage for home games
winnipegjets,lxjrdwd,2024-11-16 23:51:17,Did line 1 get benched? I didn’t pay close attention after the shortie
winnipegjets,lxjtpo8,2024-11-17 00:09:34,Good. But their style of play is to just try to bully/antagonize other teams constantly dirty or not then scrum after the whistle. They’re effective at it and don’t seem to get called as often as they should. But we’ll see them again Tuesday and hopefully be more prepared.
winnipegjets,lxjatbi,2024-11-16 21:53:31,But it’s exactly what’s happened the last few years in playoffs.  Our opponent adapts to our game and we get swept.Downvote me all you want.  It’s exactly what happened.  A team figures us out and sweeps us because we don’t adapt.
winnipegjets,lxjabkh,2024-11-16 21:50:15,And we also swept the Avalanche through the regular season last year and look what happened. Once we get figured out we panic and don’t make any adjustments.
winnipegjets,lxncs9k,2024-11-17 15:45:26,That's because he's playing for a big fat contract on another team.
winnipegjets,lxjobv1,2024-11-16 23:27:38,I'll agree with this. I've often been an Appleton critic since he came back from Seattle but I'll give him his credit when credit is due; he was constantly throwing his body around for a full body forecheck to keep the puck inside the opponent's zone and he has been all season.
winnipegjets,lxjxwpr,2024-11-17 00:44:18,We don't want to think that yet but I agree. We played our system but it has been figured out the last two games.
winnipegjets,lxjcgvo,2024-11-16 22:04:32,So what then the panthers coaches are the only ones capable of figuring out the Jets?
winnipegjets,lxm7d3a,2024-11-17 12:02:21,High motor. Just needs better hands.
winnipegjets,lxjjf5l,2024-11-16 22:51:34,Hopefully and hopefully we don’t face them in the finals if that’s the case lol
winnipegjets,lxirr3x,2024-11-16 19:50:49,Their neglect and lack of talk about first place is nothing to us and our team. The Jets will succeed or fail on their own merits and this season has shown them shown us  they can do it.Screw SN and the lack of a bandwagon. Let them wait for their I told you so moment and lets live in a world of hope for OUR team. It's not theirs. And should we continue and get to the playoffs get to the final and with baited breath dare to say Lord Stanley's name... Let's shun their surprise and then cry out at their earlier mockery. Have them deal with the realization they are the petty ones. They are the cowards.We chose to be brave because we need to believe in deepest souls they are wrong they are foolish and we yearn to be proven right. Words against them will not vanquish that fear only a cup at Portage and Main will fill out hearts again. Go Jets Go

winnipegjets,lxism4m,2024-11-16 19:56:08,Maybe ScarboroughNet can have a good cry if the Oilers give the Laffs a good pounding tonight. They've taken over the former CBC Hockey tendency of talking about the Leafs during games that don't feature Toronto at all. It's all they care about. The Jets have a playoff caliber team right here in first place. These hosts are never gonna change...
winnipegjets,lxisoe5,2024-11-16 19:56:30,It’s illegal to say Winnipeg is in first place.

winnipegjets,lxjjyge,2024-11-16 22:55:20,Right now the Jets are:* league average (slightly below) in creating scoring chances at 5v5* below leave average in creating scoring chances on the power play* league average (slightly above) in preventing scoring chances at 5v5* league average (slightly above) in preventing scoring chances on the penalty kill* above average goaltending* craaaaazy finishing Most of these are the same as last year except the last one.That’s why they are in first place.

So yeah we know what you’re doing.

He played with an intriguing combination of feistiness fearlessness and skill in high-traffic areas that instantly made the 2024 fourth-round pick a player of interest. But even his good training camp didn’t prepare us for what followed: 17 goals 12 assists and 29 points in his first 19 OHL games for Niagara. He scored 31 goals last season and could obliterate that total by Christmas at this rate.Hope to see his upward trajectory continue. The Jets could use another hit in a mid round pick.

winnipegjets,lxiuqtg,2024-11-16 20:09:34,Two posts Christ we have no puck luck.
winnipegjets,lxixfo5,2024-11-16 20:26:39,One thing I’ve noticed: when we play heavy forechecking teams we try and match their aggressiveness but we simply don’t have the horses to win the puck races and board battles like they do
winnipegjets,lxizh1g,2024-11-16 20:39:21,Full Jerts. Never go full Jerts.
winnipegjets,lxj4dvl,2024-11-16 21:10:55,Wtf is going on man haven’t been able watch but keep checking the score

winnipegjets,lxj5rc7,2024-11-16 21:19:57,Story of the game 3 players watching the puck no one makes a play on it and it stays in the zone
winnipegjets,lxj763w,2024-11-16 21:29:21,Every shot right at goalie’s chest
winnipegjets,lxj5dqi,2024-11-16 21:17:29,Ouch the overrated chant hurts. I wanna play those bad teams again

winnipegjets,lxiqava,2024-11-16 19:41:56,Fluke goal but that play shouldn't have been there in the first place
winnipegjets,lxisbok,2024-11-16 19:54:20,This will be a test. Let's see how the boys will respond to the physicality of the Panties

winnipegjets,lxiyyvt,2024-11-16 20:36:12,Team can’t lose in a close manner. Always a fucking blow out.
winnipegjets,lxj5dco,2024-11-16 21:17:25,Came back to the TV to check the score and its 5-0https://preview.redd.it/jksql86sfd1e1.jpeg?width=1244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a12004ab6fd84e5209563c064ae600f4cfe28c21

winnipegjets,lxj7ktj,2024-11-16 21:32:02,All six Panthers fans discovered chanting at hockey games
winnipegjets,lxeg14t,2024-11-16 02:29:35,To be honest I don't even care if the Jets lose this game as long as they play hard for 60 min and each center has two primary assists
winnipegjets,lxiqod7,2024-11-16 19:44:12,i feel like teams have  realized if they just put constant pressure we just crumble
winnipegjets,lxiwrre,2024-11-16 20:22:24,Our only two plays right now seem to be:1)Desperation pass cross ice which gets turned over2)Dump the puck in and lose possession
winnipegjets,lxiyaxm,2024-11-16 20:32:01,These jets are playing like they’re a 58 year Mike Tyson
winnipegjets,lxj5c60,2024-11-16 21:17:12,My dog ate 3 full size striploin steaks that were thawing in the sink. Jets down 5-0. This Saturday fucking blows

winnipegjets,lxioaka,2024-11-16 19:29:30,Our passing is a mess right now. 2nd game is a row now where the boys are crumbling when the other team plays up in their face.
winnipegjets,lxiq721,2024-11-16 19:41:16,It feels like we don't have an answer to heavy pressure
winnipegjets,lxiqc5a,2024-11-16 19:42:09,Is it just me or is it painful watching hockey like this SN feed
winnipegjets,lxiqrl0,2024-11-16 19:44:44,Panthers playing hungry after those losses to NJ
winnipegjets,lxir8rb,2024-11-16 19:47:40,Jets are playing regular season hockey Panthers are playing playoff style hockey and the results speak for themselves.
winnipegjets,lxirjtq,2024-11-16 19:49:34,Good thing Helle & Ehlers came to play without those 2 this could really be ugly
winnipegjets,lxiv9x6,2024-11-16 20:12:54,WTF was that call?! Zebras need to GTFOH (again).
winnipegjets,lxivcoj,2024-11-16 20:13:23,Florida player goes down easily but you can't be doing that to a guy who doesn't have the puck that close to boards bad play by Kupari
winnipegjets,lxivhpn,2024-11-16 20:14:17,They really love that growling sound effect lol

winnipegjets,lxizds1,2024-11-16 20:38:47,Put the lines in a blender already
winnipegjets,lxj0r0t,2024-11-16 20:47:22,We’re up against the Stanley Cup champs  it was never gonna be easy.  That said  I would like to see us score at least once and avoid being shut out!
winnipegjets,lxj1vdc,2024-11-16 20:54:33,They have to wake up it seems like they are short handed the panthers are all over them.  I get the travel but they've been down there for a while.  Looked slow against tampa okay but 2 in a row?
winnipegjets,lxj670a,2024-11-16 21:22:48,Reminded me of Tyson vs Paul fight
winnipegjets,lxj68zv,2024-11-16 21:23:10,Ya Scheif.  Fuck It!  Let’s Dance!!!
winnipegjets,lxj6air,2024-11-16 21:23:28,Can’t even win a fight today…
winnipegjets,lxj9tns,2024-11-16 21:46:54,Jets don't want you to know they are tanking to not get the presidents trophy curse
winnipegjets,lxj5ij4,2024-11-16 21:18:22,I guess Logan Stanley was the key to our success
winnipegjets,lxj00z0,2024-11-16 20:42:48,It’s gonna be really hard to win most nights when 44 55 and 81 are your worst players and Helle isn’t going God mode
winnipegjets,lxij9eh,2024-11-16 18:58:39,Opting for the Panther feed as opposed to sportsnet on mute.

winnipegjets,lxfpzq3,2024-11-16 09:32:13,Must win!
winnipegjets,lxinyzt,2024-11-16 19:27:32,We're floundering in our own end right now.
winnipegjets,lxio7zn,2024-11-16 19:29:04,what are these fucking passes
winnipegjets,lxio8aw,2024-11-16 19:29:07,anyone get a sam reinhart goal notification from the jets app??
winnipegjets,lxiodt7,2024-11-16 19:30:03,Seeing some NHL hockey tonight.
winnipegjets,lxiogsu,2024-11-16 19:30:34,Strong start but they started getting pressured and now aren't making crisp passes. Feels like a playoff game
winnipegjets,lxiq81z,2024-11-16 19:41:27,Helle looked pissed at that goal.They just need to redirect the pressure back onto Florida get more time at their end and eventually they'll sink a few. Right now they don't seem to be responding well to the pressure Florida is putting on them.
winnipegjets,lxiqbwd,2024-11-16 19:42:07,Ehlers is the only one playing hard rn. Boys gotta wake up
winnipegjets,lxiqh11,2024-11-16 19:42:59,Does it feel like when we're trapped with the puck in our zone..  it's like we're playing hot potato with the puck when we get it?
winnipegjets,lxir28q,2024-11-16 19:46:33,JMO has gotta stop pinching he’s almost gotten burned multiple times
winnipegjets,lxirh89,2024-11-16 19:49:08,No room out there.

winnipegjets,lxiy1jp,2024-11-16 20:30:24,What is wrong with them every time after a Rangers road win.
winnipegjets,lxiy1mn,2024-11-16 20:30:25,Enough of these win streaks let’s try a losing one.
winnipegjets,lxiyzib,2024-11-16 20:36:19,"As long as we're not totally ""figured out"" it's expected to string a few losses together lol. But damn we need to adjust"
winnipegjets,lxiz1ih,2024-11-16 20:36:40,What a fucking disaster of a game…
winnipegjets,lxiz40h,2024-11-16 20:37:06,Curious to know how many players woke up hungover this morning from the Miami bottle service.
winnipegjets,lxizc39,2024-11-16 20:38:30,I miss goals from the Jets 
winnipegjets,lxizsoj,2024-11-16 20:41:22,Not even competitive. Jesus guys. Wasn't last year bad enough in the playoffs? They gotta be better then this.
winnipegjets,lxj0ju7,2024-11-16 20:46:06,so how hard have they been partying in florida lol
winnipegjets,lxj5cwx,2024-11-16 21:17:20,Shelf on the 4th line?
winnipegjets,lxj8u9g,2024-11-16 21:40:24,This is what the panthers do the last 4-5 mins have just been scrums with zero momentum. Then you’re down 3-4 players in the dressing room.
winnipegjets,lxehxvq,2024-11-16 02:49:59,I got carded at a liquor store and my Blockbuster card accidentally fell out.The cashier said never mind

winnipegjets,lxiq8t0,2024-11-16 19:41:34,no mention of the trip on morrisey
winnipegjets,lxirmy4,2024-11-16 19:50:06,It feels dumb to be worried about two games but I really don't like that the lightning and Panthers have played really similar games against it and it's working really well

winnipegjets,lxga3uv,2024-11-16 11:29:04,Go Jets Go!!!
winnipegjets,lxit9jo,2024-11-16 20:00:12,I’m listening on radio and just played the panthers goal replay.  How the fuck was that not a tripping call?   Guy reaches his stick in on JMo (usually a penalty in and of itself) then pushes JMo over his stick and hauls him down gets up skates to the net and scores.  The fuck.
winnipegjets,lxiuqcb,2024-11-16 20:09:29,Jets are a very skilled and very deep team but they lack a top 6 F that plays physical like a bennett or tkachuk and any time they a play a team that has that component and plays “playoff style” their skill is less noticeable and kept to the perimeter
winnipegjets,lxiz0fw,2024-11-16 20:36:29,55 is just so soft in our zone. Glides everywhere picks up just about no one... seriously a pilon would be more efficient!
winnipegjets,lxj3xga,2024-11-16 21:07:53,Feels like we haven’t been able to connect a pass all night
winnipegjets,lxj7wmp,2024-11-16 21:34:09,Dare I say the sportsnet broadcast has actually been good!
winnipegjets,lxj8koi,2024-11-16 21:38:38,The lack of toughness is on full display this evening. Panthers are manhandling.
winnipegjets,lxj5bbv,2024-11-16 21:17:03,Overrated  hard to disagree watching these last two games
winnipegjets,lxfk8sx,2024-11-16 08:54:05,SCORE PREDICTIONS: Predict the player you think scores first from either team and final score including the winning team! Must be submitted by the time first period begins!

winnipegjets,lxinjaa,2024-11-16 19:24:53,Why did that feel like a pk
winnipegjets,lxio9q7,2024-11-16 19:29:22,This looks like last game except more scary.
winnipegjets,lxioloo,2024-11-16 19:31:24,Can we get more action in their zone now?

winnipegjets,lxiz0m2,2024-11-16 20:36:31,Do we pull Helle for Coms? Probably be the first team to yank our goalie during  a power play 
winnipegjets,lxiz0sy,2024-11-16 20:36:32,scheduled loss. a night for learning. they are outclassed
winnipegjets,lxiz2hc,2024-11-16 20:36:50,Hey it’s the jerts. Been awhile. Honestly I think the panthers might be my most disliked team so this one stings.
winnipegjets,lxiz3nj,2024-11-16 20:37:02,Playoff teams bringing their A game is our kryptonite. Our bounce back game will be the Pens.
winnipegjets,lxizdwa,2024-11-16 20:38:49,Just saw the score. Glad I'm not watching this one...
winnipegjets,lxj0n53,2024-11-16 20:46:41,Passing sucks and the d is nowhere to be seen to clear out rebounds. Everyone is slow physically and late mentally. Oh well I think the need a couple days off

winnipegjets,lxiyfzd,2024-11-16 20:32:54,Jets getting a front-row seat to see what a good playoff hockey team looks like. Hopefully they learn something from the experience.
winnipegjets,lxiv4ku,2024-11-16 20:11:58,That’s a stupid play from Kupari that’s the type of penalty that gets you scratched the next game
winnipegjets,lxiwgpj,2024-11-16 20:20:27,“Nate Schmidt is playing better in florida” or does he just not have 5m cap hit anymore
winnipegjets,lxiyyo9,2024-11-16 20:36:10,Thats game we back to being frauds.Coach you need to come up with a gameplan for these boys

winnipegjets,lxizhrb,2024-11-16 20:39:29,No plan for aggressive teams. Once other teams see this our weakness is known and we are done like dinner.

winnipegjets,lxire7p,2024-11-16 19:48:37,Well Ehlers showed up to play. It just seems like no one else is in a position to make a play when they get the puck.
winnipegjets,lxj2kub,2024-11-16 20:59:04,Is this going to be a gnarly 4th period comeback?!?
winnipegjets,lxj440y,2024-11-16 21:09:06,The Jets are just garbage tonight especially the D.  They’re not even trying to cover their men or clean up rebounds.
winnipegjets,lxgseyq,2024-11-16 13:07:03,I completely accept that the Jets aren't winning every game but I was unhappy just how uncompetitive the Tampa game was so I ask for at the very least an interesting game.
winnipegjets,lxj1r5b,2024-11-16 20:53:49,Score ONE  fucking goal for fuckssake
winnipegjets,lxj48ge,2024-11-16 21:09:54,Jesus I picked a bad night to switch my Helly jersey in and wash my Connor jersey. I’m sorry everyone I caused this…..

winnipegjets,lxj19ve,2024-11-16 20:50:43,I think we all knew eventually that the team would level off. The season is long it is only November.  I understand people were excited by the team's play but please be realistic.

winnipegjets,lxixzzu,2024-11-16 20:30:08,Dear Winnipeg Jets.....WAKE UP!
winnipegjets,lxiy0jb,2024-11-16 20:30:13,sob sob
winnipegjets,lxizl3k,2024-11-16 20:40:02,Am I going crazy here or are the photographers going absolutely nuts with the flash on tonight’s game? I feel like you get a flash every 5-10 seconds in a typical game and the screen is flashing 4 times a second tonight. Tried multiple devices so I think it’s an issue with trigger happy photographers in Florida tonight?
winnipegjets,lxj908d,2024-11-16 21:41:30,Spanked. Why?
winnipegjets,lxit5ky,2024-11-16 19:59:30,I picked a bad game to bet on the jets lol
winnipegjets,lxivwl3,2024-11-16 20:16:56,Flopida panthers
winnipegjets,lxiwo4k,2024-11-16 20:21:45,They ain't got it tonight
winnipegjets,lxiy0hz,2024-11-16 20:30:13,Are we bad? /s
winnipegjets,lxisj2j,2024-11-16 19:55:37,I barely recognize this team at the moment. They will get their shit together but it had better be fucking soon.
winnipegjets,lxiwegj,2024-11-16 20:20:03,Are the Jets frauds again? 
winnipegjets,lxj0mh4,2024-11-16 20:46:34,We’re 15-3 and you guys are losing your shit. Never seen so many soft people how do you all handle life?
winnipegjets,lxj04el,2024-11-16 20:43:25,After looking like amateurs against Olympic athletes in last playoffs we should have fired the staff who are responsible of physical conditioning of our team and hired some hard asses to put the team in shape. But unfortunately Chevy is way too soft hearted what come to firing staff members and this is the result.
winnipegjets,lxj95d0,2024-11-16 21:42:26,What a fucking joke. How do you get absolutely smacked by the panthers
winnipegjets,lxiunlo,2024-11-16 20:09:00,We haven’t had a good period in a while now
winnipegjets,lxiy48c,2024-11-16 20:30:52,Paul Maurice knows how to beat the Jets
winnipegjets,lxinect,2024-11-16 19:24:02,Why do we hate SN so much?
winnipegjets,lxj06p0,2024-11-16 20:43:49,You guys look slow man
winnipegjets,lxgmjfe,2024-11-16 12:36:01,Yes thank you!
winnipegjets,lxfae7e,2024-11-16 07:41:36,It’s been sooo long since I saw them win I can’t remember
winnipegjets,lxf2pga,2024-11-16 06:32:58,I'll take 65-0-0 to close out the rest of the season please.
winnipegjets,lxhhlt7,2024-11-16 15:22:20,Pomo is a real one. I don’t know that there’s really any other coaches that would dare to ever admit that
winnipegjets,lxhwkbg,2024-11-16 16:44:01,>“There is no animosity there. If they’re not playing the Florida Panthers I cheer for the Winnipeg Jets.”who tf is cuttin onions in here

winnipegjets,lxhf57c,2024-11-16 15:08:44,What a classy classy man.
winnipegjets,lxhlly0,2024-11-16 15:44:11,It was time for him to leave when he did but he was never the problem. It was Huddy and TNSE's fetish for loyalty.
winnipegjets,lxidfig,2024-11-16 18:22:16,Always loved Pomo. It was easy to spot his loyalty to the Jets. He only left when he felt he could no longer effect change.
winnipegjets,lxhpw8h,2024-11-16 16:07:26,
winnipegjets,lxj9lku,2024-11-16 21:45:27,I mean he wants to sign a big contract with an actual contender after this season is done so gotta show up every game.
winnipegjets,lxj1cix,2024-11-16 20:51:11,Lmao i was thinking that same thing
winnipegjets,lxj4rer,2024-11-16 21:13:23,ex players score on their old teams so often lol its like they know the secret to score
winnipegjets,lxj4o3u,2024-11-16 21:12:47,It literally always happens. Always
winnipegjets,lxiyhwl,2024-11-16 20:33:15,It’s entirely possible that we’ve just hit our limit with how condensed the schedule has been for us this last month
winnipegjets,lxj1ydt,2024-11-16 20:55:04,This is what I try to tell people. A loss is fine. We aren't going to go 81-1. That being said this is just showing that if the other team finds that one weakness we're cooked. Like every time. Then we run it back the next year. It's hard to keep watching when you know the inevitable collapse will happen.
winnipegjets,lxj2ifk,2024-11-16 20:58:38,Yeah that’s the thing.  Losing is one thing but they’re getting run over like a lottery team again.
winnipegjets,lxj9j9b,2024-11-16 21:45:01,Yup...especially Schiefele. Love the guy but they were in his head all night.
winnipegjets,lxgsvlc,2024-11-16 13:09:30,Finally the 2C the Jets have been looking for.
winnipegjets,lxgvr6b,2024-11-16 13:24:53,I think they’re genuinely good. They remind me of the 20–23 Jets the last few years—competitive enough as a bubble team but confusingly so—and now with Faber Boldy Rossi taking steps forward they’re turning a corner (see Winnipeg with coaching changes + depth additions/Vilardi/Perfetti + Samberg progression).Kaprizov is dynamite obviously and Eriksson Ek Spurgeon and Brodin are all quite balanced as players. Gustafsson has performed excellently over the course of a full season in the past and they have Wallstedt in the goaltending pipeline. Once they’re out of the woods of the Suter/Parise buyouts (this summer I think) if they keep KK god they will be a thorn in our side.Pretty remarkable how they’ve managed this cap hell portion of their history honestly. I respect it and I am prepared to be annoyed by them if they continue their trajectory over the next few years.
winnipegjets,lxfx7bi,2024-11-16 10:16:47,Same as always. Krill has triple the points of anyone else… until he gets injured. F. Gustavsson is having a unsustainable career best season start in net.
winnipegjets,lxiypib,2024-11-16 20:34:34,Ranger fan here in peace. I sympathize mightily. And Fuck the Cats. Go Jets!
winnipegjets,lxj7vyn,2024-11-16 21:34:02,Only one that showed up
winnipegjets,lxg80fu,2024-11-16 11:17:35,I don’t get to listen to the games on radio much because I’d rather watch but when I’m in the car I always have it on. Also appreciate that the Jets media/replays insert his calls in their videos regularly.
winnipegjets,lxihr70,2024-11-16 18:49:20,I listen to the radio broadcast almost every game because I’m usually at work. Paul Edmonds does great work.
winnipegjets,lxisi00,2024-11-16 19:55:26,4 periods 1 goal. All part of the plan?
winnipegjets,lxiungv,2024-11-16 20:08:59,Too much partying in Miami

winnipegjets,lxixpnu,2024-11-16 20:28:23,We need to do what worked last few games speed through the neutral zone
winnipegjets,lxj4n5k,2024-11-16 21:12:36,Jets are slow and puck watching.  It doesn’t really look like they’re giving it much of an effort lazy bad passes too.
winnipegjets,lxj5jky,2024-11-16 21:18:33,They look overrated
winnipegjets,lxizf7z,2024-11-16 20:39:02,Panthers aren’t giving any space and closing in fast. Much like the playoffs it’s effective.They also look pretty sloppy so I wonder what’s throwing them off puck seems bouncing all around.
winnipegjets,lxizkfq,2024-11-16 20:39:56,We hate pressure.
winnipegjets,lxiyoir,2024-11-16 20:34:24,can’t breakout of our zone

winnipegjets,lxj1asl,2024-11-16 20:50:53,*Stanley cup Champs at home. That's a tough environment to play in when you're far from home and the number one team in the NHL. I want us to score one (or even two) this 3rd period then lock it back in once we bring them to our home ice
winnipegjets,lxj6cr8,2024-11-16 21:23:53,I didn't see anyone's ass
winnipegjets,lxj7msd,2024-11-16 21:32:23,Is your Jets feed buffering?

winnipegjets,lxiv00m,2024-11-16 20:11:09,I can't tell whether the boys are just checked out or if they've finally reached their limit after pretty much 3 weeks of only 1 day breaks. But they haven't looked good in Florida so far.
winnipegjets,lxiv8v3,2024-11-16 20:12:43,That's to remind us that we're playing like ASS!
winnipegjets,lxiz51p,2024-11-16 20:37:17,Ahaha right. Same thing last year.
winnipegjets,lxeczno,2024-11-16 01:58:26,I’ll have you know I’m only up past my bedtime in hindsight

winnipegjets,lxis1vp,2024-11-16 19:52:39,There isn’t a team in the NHL that can play with the pace Tampa or Florida are playing with for 82 games - that’s the main tradeoff with using it
winnipegjets,lxj3rsg,2024-11-16 21:06:50,Lore accurate tonight
winnipegjets,lxiu5jo,2024-11-16 20:05:49,Watching it in full speed it really doesn’t look like a trip more JMo just getting outmuscled off the puck
winnipegjets,lxiubf9,2024-11-16 20:06:51,The Jets are always playing the Zebras and the other team.
winnipegjets,lxiv169,2024-11-16 20:11:22,Agreed. We need an Optimus Prime top 6F to rattle some cages but I doubt we'll see that anytime soon.
winnipegjets,lxiv1j0,2024-11-16 20:11:26,Prime example would be how nichuskin looked like a man playing against boys and did what ever he wanted in the playoffs

winnipegjets,lxj2odo,2024-11-16 20:59:43,Yeah multiple goals against where the D are just standing there *watching* the Cats put it in.
winnipegjets,lxj0mvw,2024-11-16 20:46:38,They learned nothing against Tampa
winnipegjets,lxfjvvr,2024-11-16 08:51:36,I got 8 hours of sleep last night and watched 3 minutes of highlights this morning and it was still a waste of time.
winnipegjets,lxi7xee,2024-11-16 17:48:15,Meh he probably should have been let go much sooner. I’m glad he did what Chevy wasn’t willing to do
winnipegjets,lxikjvd,2024-11-16 19:06:35,Sportsnet quality lol
winnipegjets,lxiosv8,2024-11-16 19:32:37,First betting now this
winnipegjets,lxj30w6,2024-11-16 21:02:01,If they actually showed up played their game and got a little luck they could but the Jets ain’t in Florida.  Their heads are somewhere else.
winnipegjets,lxgz3bh,2024-11-16 13:42:26,All of our top guys were off that night and Tampa was playing their best. I don't think a 7 game series would look like that the whole way. The fact Tampa had 6 days off in preparation for the game too that doesn't usually have in the regular season.I'm really not perturbed by the loss at all. If we have two more bad showings against Florida then I'd sound the alarm.
winnipegjets,lxgtz4w,2024-11-16 13:15:28,Hard when a team has an answer for everything you throw at them and then plays one/two steps ahead.
winnipegjets,lxisleh,2024-11-16 19:56:00,More been really hard to connect passes
winnipegjets,lxiy486,2024-11-16 20:30:52,Nope. God he's such a liability in our zone! An absolute pilon!
winnipegjets,lxizbl0,2024-11-16 20:38:25,None of this is Helle's fault. None.
winnipegjets,lxizcve,2024-11-16 20:38:38,This is not on helle at all
winnipegjets,lxizcmg,2024-11-16 20:38:35,Not a single person on the ice has had a good game
winnipegjets,lxj7w57,2024-11-16 21:34:04,Oh no penalty wtf
winnipegjets,lxiqev0,2024-11-16 19:42:37,The reffing was very on our side last game.

winnipegjets,lxj973v,2024-11-16 21:42:46,… because I like it.

winnipegjets,lxj0h83,2024-11-16 20:45:39,You should calculate the number of kms the team has had to travel in the last month. The fact they made it this long before losing steam is impressive unto itself
winnipegjets,lxj9bn0,2024-11-16 21:43:37,They're defending champs lol.
winnipegjets,lxje8sn,2024-11-16 22:16:26,The panthers won the cup?
winnipegjets,lxiuv1r,2024-11-16 20:10:17,Not even a game and a half. Jesus Christ people......
winnipegjets,lxiy5zd,2024-11-16 20:31:10,He literally has not beaten the Jets since he left
winnipegjets,lxiyl39,2024-11-16 20:33:49,Except in the previous 4 games the Jets and Panthers have played
winnipegjets,lxion5g,2024-11-16 19:31:39,They barely talk about us and when they do they underrate us
winnipegjets,lxj0im3,2024-11-16 20:45:53,Jets just letting the lower ranked teams win to make them feel good
winnipegjets,lxj0qy5,2024-11-16 20:47:21,The Jets have always been slow that's why they tend to play a possession and high-passing game. Just wish we would have figured out that we need a plan to deal with high-pressure teams.

winnipegjets,lxjvnxg,2024-11-17 00:25:51,Lol majority of the team wears that title on this night. Morrissey and DeMelo were especially awful. At least scheif showed some emotion towards the end. Need to see that from the get-go Tuesday.
winnipegjets,lxhxj0a,2024-11-16 16:49:22,This is it. They're dependent on Kaprizov and Eriksson Ek. They're playing very unsustainable hockey.
winnipegjets,lxga868,2024-11-16 11:29:44,Well he had a .931 2 years ago so it’s very possible Gus could stay around .920 imo. He had a bad year last year but he seems like he’ll be a really good goalie for years to come
winnipegjets,lxislyw,2024-11-16 19:56:06,They weren’t going to go 81-1 they were bound to have bad games and bad periods? Not sure what your point is

winnipegjets,lxisyoc,2024-11-16 19:58:17,Doesn't matter how many games in the regular season - all that matters is if they can play 7 like this against us in the playoffs
winnipegjets,lxiye9e,2024-11-16 20:32:37,Sure but his stick wraps around JMo’s feet and he pushes him forward.  Not that it matters much now not exactly a close one.
winnipegjets,lxj128u,2024-11-16 20:49:22,It's certainly not their strong suit.
winnipegjets,lxg0h5l,2024-11-16 10:35:49,I chose Deadpool & Wolverine as my viewing choice last night followed by the replay of Riders/Bombers.  I came out way ahead.
winnipegjets,lxi8xrs,2024-11-16 17:54:17,For sure his time was up. Just never felt right in the middle of a season and potential playoff push.
winnipegjets,lxh343u,2024-11-16 14:03:54,And maybe has shit ice that they're used to playing on.

winnipegjets,lxiznh5,2024-11-16 20:40:28,I hate this line of thinking. Helle isn’t the reason we’re down 4-0 but he’s also not exactly having a world class night either
winnipegjets,lxj9ged,2024-11-16 21:44:29,you’re right it was 2015 and it was Emerson Etem lol
winnipegjets,lxj9w8e,2024-11-16 21:47:23,2 in a row. Worrisome
winnipegjets,lxj9ph0,2024-11-16 21:46:10,Yeah but to not score any goals when youre currently the best team in the league is a joke
winnipegjets,lxive9c,2024-11-16 20:13:40,I mean I feel the concern too. If this game continues the way it is. We aren't losing close games to good teams we're getting thoroughly handled. Thankfully we have a cushion to figure it out. But it's not a good look.
winnipegjets,lxivoy9,2024-11-16 20:15:35,Am I lying? I’m not saying we’re not gonna make the playoffs and to fire Arnie!

winnipegjets,lxhupzx,2024-11-16 16:33:52,Rangers have notoriously awful ice and they managed bad ice isn’t really an excuse
winnipegjets,lxizibc,2024-11-16 20:39:34,Ah gotcha. Yeah without Helle this is 6-0 or worse.
winnipegjets,lxj03tz,2024-11-16 20:43:19,Really? He's robbed a couple of high-danger chances and let out a single bad rebound the defense failed to deal with. The team in front of him is a dumpster fire giving up chances non-stop.
winnipegjets,lxivmso,2024-11-16 20:15:11,We literally beat Dallas and the Rags throughly in the last week
winnipegjets,lxf1nyf,2024-11-16 06:22:48,The rivalry really hasn't been there the last few years. It's quite nice seeing them at the bottom of the standings where they belong.
winnipegjets,lxg0iuu,2024-11-16 10:36:06,IT CAN'T BE TURNED OFF!!
winnipegjets,lxj5i6g,2024-11-16 21:18:18,He did but that juicy rebound on soft shot on the 2nd goal was definitely not a great moment
winnipegjets,lx9w52s,2024-11-15 10:12:05,More of a coffee table read but ‘Back in the Bigs: How Winnipeg Won Lost and Regained Its Place in the NHL’ by Randy Turner covers their history from their birth as a franchise with the WHA and ultimately the merge with the NHL in 1979 onto the loss of the team in 1996 and their eventual return as the 2.0 team in 2011. It’s authored by the late great Randy Turner.
winnipegjets,lx9noqv,2024-11-15 09:26:36,Not Jets related but I really enjoyed The Game by Ken Dryden.

winnipegjets,lxacmpu,2024-11-15 11:34:37,The Rebel League covers all of the WHA and not just the Jets but I still really enjoyed it. The WHA was before my time and I picked up some of that stuff through cultural osmosis but a lot of it was new to me and it was a fun read.
winnipegjets,lxa556o,2024-11-15 10:57:30,Got my hands on a book called Thin Ice by Jim Silver about the collapse of 1.0 haven't read it myself yet but hoping to soon. Teemu Selanne's autobiography is kind of interesting in the fact that it makes his dad's obsessive dedication to his son's hockey career and insisting that if he was gonna play hockey at all it would be 100% no holds barred seem totally normal and not controlling and weird. Some fun stories in there though. I'm sure later editions will also remove the sections where he talks about how close the Selanne's became to the Nygards lol.*When the Lights Went Out: How One Brawl Ended Hockey's Cold War and Changed the Game* by Gare Joyce tells the story of the infamous 1987 World Junior brawl between Canada and the Soviets profiles the context of the tournament itself it's legacy (or lack thereof) as well as the players involved on both teams including Theo Fleury. Interesting read.A couple books that are essay collections about the intersection between hockey and Canadian culture widely (a topic that fascinates me personally) are *The Meaning of Puck: How Hockey Explains Modern Canada* by Bruce Dowbiggen and *Canada's Game: Hockey and Identity* edited by Andrew C. Holman
winnipegjets,lx9x4ha,2024-11-15 10:17:06,if you like memoirs call me indian by fred sasakamoose is a really great read. jordan too too's books are also well received.
winnipegjets,lxdlgbv,2024-11-15 22:21:24,[Broken Wings: The sordid history of the NHL’s Atlanta Thrashers](https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Wings-history-Thrashers-1999-2011-ebook/dp/B07YF4GT9C?dplnkId=9aed5b5b-b4c4-4cf7-a61c-18a4149a454c&nodl=1) It’s technically about the Jets 2.0 franchise but from before they came to Winnipeg. It’s a great read about how the Thrashers started why they moved and everything in between. The author did a great job and I think it’s worth a read for anyone interested in the southern leg of the current franchise’s history
winnipegjets,lxa12rq,2024-11-15 10:37:25,Any book by Ken Dryden regarding hockey.  But in my opinion his best book is ‘Scotty’.  Biography of Scotty Bowman. Such a good book
winnipegjets,lxartya,2024-11-15 12:49:41,Sean Prongers's Journeyman is a fun read. It's not Jets related specifically but it does cover some time he spent with the Moose. Great read for any hockey fan; it's really funny and gives some great insight into what these fringe players go through.
winnipegjets,lxaxykz,2024-11-15 13:20:09,The Winnipeg Jets: A Celebration of Professional Hockey in Winnipeg.This book is the best time capsule of everything Winnipeg Jets... including a hilarious anti drug ad featuring Dave Ellett.Also a 7Up ad that features Hawerchuk and Arniel.
winnipegjets,lxfxflm,2024-11-16 10:18:09,The Devil and Bobby Hull by Gare Joyce illuminates the legacy of the Golden Jet and particularly the dark side of his story and how it relates to the game today. Also a great guide to current systems would be the Hockey Tactics series by Jack Han.
winnipegjets,lxj4mcy,2024-11-16 21:12:28, Not about the Jets but Breakaway by Patrick O’Sullivan was a very interesting read. Trigger warning though it’s about his insanely abusive father who would do anything to make him Pro. Treated his son like an meal ticket rather than a person.
winnipegjets,lx9ph8o,2024-11-15 09:36:31,I really like Tough Guy it’s about Bob Probert and his struggle with substance abuse and mental health that combined to make him the most formidable hockey fighter of all time.
winnipegjets,lx9otvu,2024-11-15 09:32:55,I read one of  books. It was a bunch of different hockey stories. It was pretty good
winnipegjets,lx9rotd,2024-11-15 09:48:35,Burkes Law by Brian Burke was a really good read definitely recommendA very very good book I enjoyed is Bear Town by Frederik Backman. One of my favourite fiction novels as someone who typically doesn’t delve too deep in that genre.Some of the others I’ve read that I enjoyed:Orr My StorySports illustration The Great OneMr Hockey
winnipegjets,lxa9lij,2024-11-15 11:19:35,Currently reading The Franchise by Craig Custance... phenomenal book.
winnipegjets,lxbx2dw,2024-11-15 16:17:23,"as a kid i rememeber liking ""scrubs on skates"".  not jets at all but its about a kid on a winnipeg hockey team (i tihnk?)"
winnipegjets,lxc2zof,2024-11-15 16:47:39,I read Jay Baruchel's [Born Into It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38369532-born-into-it) a few years back and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's mostly about his love of the Habs and how they manage to let him down every year in the playoffs which Winnipeg has been doing to me lately.
winnipegjets,lxc6lji,2024-11-15 17:06:37,Not the best and not the Jets but I read Semenko’s book years ago and really enjoyed it.
winnipegjets,lxcn3ee,2024-11-15 18:41:10,Curt Keilback - Two Minutes for Talking to Myself. A little disjointed but great Jet stories.
winnipegjets,lxdz1r1,2024-11-15 23:57:10,There's lots of good suggestions here but I'm going to add a couple more good hockey books that I highly recommend;[Hockey 365: Daily Stories from the Ice](https://www.amazon.ca/Hockey-365-Daily-Stories-Ice/dp/1459741846/ref=) by Mike Commito.

winnipegjets,lxbyjd7,2024-11-15 16:24:55,I own this book and it's great. Highly recommended.
winnipegjets,lxb9uro,2024-11-15 14:18:57,Really? I tried to read it last year for the first time. Sure lots of interesting stuff about the 1970s Habs dynasty. But also very dense and boring. Very overrated.
winnipegjets,lx8vaye,2024-11-15 06:11:59,I don’t remember all the specifics but I’m pretty sure enstrom had no move protection which meant he was ineligible for the expansion draft. The only reason he was available was because he waived that protection specifically because Chevy promised to make sure he would not get claimed via this trade. I’m not saying this trade was the right way to go but if enstrom didn’t waive his no move it would have left different players exposed which may have been more appealing to Vegas. Probably trouba or Morrissey if I’m remembering correctly.
winnipegjets,lx99574,2024-11-15 07:58:40,Mark twain over here
winnipegjets,lx9aksq,2024-11-15 08:08:04,Its very easy to say go back in time and do this this and that. But in 2017 this was a good trade for us at the time we had a 2C in Little and going out the way he did was unexpected you can't blame the Jets for that. We  made the conference finals that same year.
winnipegjets,lx9ez2p,2024-11-15 08:35:38,You missed the real one. When we took Jack Roslovic Sebastián Aho was selected by the Carolina hurricanes like 7 picks later.
winnipegjets,lx9mw5n,2024-11-15 09:22:09,Coulda...shoula...woulda in 2017.
winnipegjets,lx9k16a,2024-11-15 09:05:42,I ain't reading all that. I'm happy for u tho. Or sorry that happened.
winnipegjets,lx9oy1o,2024-11-15 09:33:33,I may have this wrong it's been so long but without these actions we would've lost Lowry.
winnipegjets,lx9zije,2024-11-15 10:29:15,Enstrom was the fucking man tho. We don’t make it to the conference finals without him imo.
winnipegjets,lxa1kt5,2024-11-15 10:39:40,There is zero guarantee that Suzuki would have been the Jets pick at 13.
winnipegjets,lx9elre,2024-11-15 08:33:24,It got too long you say?
winnipegjets,lx922w8,2024-11-15 07:08:30,It would have been Armia most likely.  I think everyone learned from that experience that it’s not worth it to make deals with the expansion team and to just take their loss on one player at expansion draft time. It’s too bad the NHL freezes rosters because if you look at a team like Colorado back then they could have used their protection slots to acquire a couple decent players who were exposed.
winnipegjets,lx8w283,2024-11-15 06:18:46,Morrissey was exempt. The D that were protected were Byfuglien Trouba and Myers. I’d assume that if Enstrom had to be protected then Myers would just have been exposed. That or they go the 8 skater and 1 goalie route and protect all 4 D Scheifele Little Wheeler Hellebuyck and one of Lowry/Perreault (Laine Ehlers and Connor were all exempt)
winnipegjets,lxaun35,2024-11-15 13:03:38,"I'm trying to stick to information the Jets would have had at the time. Very little ability to predict the future would have been needed (beyond routine projection that everyone does with every prospect with all its limitations) to take the course I suggest. Not the case with something like ""oh Aho turned out to be a superstar"" - it's true but not something we could have known at the time. It was reasonable to surmise that Suzuki or Thomas would have a floor somewhere around ""decent mid-roster center"". Vegas and Montreal both managed it in Suzuki's case."
winnipegjets,lxaglfl,2024-11-15 11:54:03,Right!? Its Friday. Give me a TLDR or hit the bricks
winnipegjets,lxa9ivx,2024-11-15 11:19:14,Armia
winnipegjets,lxaur78,2024-11-15 13:04:13,How do you figure?
winnipegjets,lxauyby,2024-11-15 13:05:13,True one reason I also mention Thomas but it's pretty likely Chevy goes for a prospect at what one assumes he'd already identified as a position of need.
winnipegjets,lx95ks9,2024-11-15 07:34:19,Yep Armia would have been the one most likely at risk.
winnipegjets,lxa16d5,2024-11-15 10:37:46,Yeah we're far from the only team to get hosed that expansion draft from their various trades (ie Florida). You see the consequences of this with Seattle's draft and how they made almost no trades.
winnipegjets,lx8wknu,2024-11-15 06:23:21,Right. So hindsight would say just leave Myers exposed but at that point moving back 10 picks to keep your team as intact as possible makes sense. There’s obviously the huge caveat of you have no idea who will be available at their original pick they may not have liked Suzuki or Thomas they may have been very high on vesalainen and he just didn’t work out. Also another solution to their 2C ‘problem’ is if roslovic had of just panned out. Or if Dubois had wanted to stay and worked out. Or stastny re-signed instead of going to Vegas or…
winnipegjets,lxaytl6,2024-11-15 13:24:22,I think Aho is illustrative as well. The Jets say that they draft BPA but I remember at the time people were saying they specifically needed another centre and that JR was supposed to be that guy. While I wish the Jets had drafted Suzuki it’s unclear if the Jets would have had that magical 2017-18 run without Enstrom. Drafting Aho over JR means the Jets likely win the cup that year and most likely have both Aho and Laine tearing up the league together right now.
winnipegjets,lxavatl,2024-11-15 13:06:56,It's literally the second paragraph and one sentence long.
winnipegjets,lxa8uxo,2024-11-15 11:15:58,Hindsight says leave Armia unprotected.They dealt him for nothing more than moving Steve Masons final year off the books a year later.They downgraded their pick for a 3rd line winger.Everyone learned from this experience to just give up the 3rd liner and move along.
winnipegjets,lxbo0vt,2024-11-15 15:31:34,Murat aside The Athletic is such garbage with today's Power Rankings - which have now been edited - featuring multiple call outs of Hellebuyck playing poorly last night. 
winnipegjets,lxab0xb,2024-11-15 11:26:39,This team needs to be kept just humble enough to prevent us being another 2023 Boston or 2019 Tampa.  Sucked watching the loss and more record breaking would have been fun but we need tastes of adversity here and there.

winnipegjets,lx9wd0u,2024-11-15 10:13:13,It's smart to only lose to teams in the east.
winnipegjets,lx9we43,2024-11-15 10:13:21,I'm proud of the boys. What an amazing start to the season. There are 65 more games. There will be highs and lows to come but they can't take this start away from them.
winnipegjets,lxa98td,2024-11-15 11:17:51,jets have won 8 lost 1 won 7 lost 1 so i am fully predicting a 6 game win streak. mark my words
winnipegjets,lxb39cg,2024-11-15 13:46:12,No reason to be upset about that loss Tampa had 6 days off to prepare for the jets they were definitely watching tapes constantly and looking for weaknesses. And they started there vezina starter when we started a young backup. Could even call it a scheduled loss
winnipegjets,lx9j2fg,2024-11-15 09:00:05,Ah man the jets only win 88.2% of their games!
winnipegjets,lx98qiy,2024-11-15 07:56:01,80-2 will be just fine
winnipegjets,lx9hfz6,2024-11-15 08:50:32,Golf is our true enemy
winnipegjets,lx9mb1s,2024-11-15 09:18:49,Next 2 games will be interesting.  FLA 1st in the Atlantic coming off back to back losses against NJ I’m thinking they are going to be pretty focussed taking on the league’s top team which is also coming off of a loss.  The home and home will just build the intensity.   This is gonna be good!
winnipegjets,lxczt5e,2024-11-15 19:59:39,Lambert back into the lineup for the Moose tonight. He missed last game with an illness
winnipegjets,lx9hrin,2024-11-15 08:52:27,I'm as disappointed as anyone in the result of the game yesterday but that's only because the Jets have been so dominant we're not used to seeing them human. I'm looking forward to seeing how this team responds tomorrow.
winnipegjets,lx9ki69,2024-11-15 09:08:28,Until we lose three in a row it's all just part of the game. Our season this far was literally unheard of. And it's kinda cool to see other fan bases buzzing after beating the Jets.

winnipegjets,lx8xdil,2024-11-15 06:30:15,When the jets go to Florida California and Vegas they need to be locked in their hotel room the entire time they are there only allowed to leave to use the gym and play the game.

It was a bit over $100 all in but I’m pretty sure the jerseys get sent to the same place that does the numbers for the actual team. Great quality only took a couple weeks and it matches the on ice kit. Super happy with both of them

winnipegjets,lxbk4ml,2024-11-15 15:11:40,They might trade him for basically the same reason we traded rutger. He’s not better than anyone currently on our roster and he doesn’t want to play in the ahl
winnipegjets,lxbjz1y,2024-11-15 15:10:53,This is satire right?
winnipegjets,lxbb6ba,2024-11-15 14:25:32,He’s available because he thinks he’s good enough to be in the nhl but isn’t. How do you propose the Jets force him into the lineup?
winnipegjets,lxb9k3d,2024-11-15 14:17:26,I don’t see Lucius getting traded. I can’t imagine he has any real value at this point
winnipegjets,lxah7n7,2024-11-15 11:57:05,Yeah no question that the Jets game improved immensely after their first loss and it's likely due to coaching and buy in. Hoping to see similar adjustments now.

winnipegjets,lxbb07z,2024-11-15 14:24:42,It’s my favourite time of the year: a player who was taken in the first round is available so he therefore must be good and my team must trade for him!!
winnipegjets,lxbai8o,2024-11-15 14:22:12,barlow's value is also probably pretty low considering his interrupted season last year and slow start this year

winnipegjets,lx74dxz,2024-11-14 21:41:08,Officially our longest losing streak of the season
winnipegjets,lx74eh4,2024-11-14 21:41:13,The Winnipeg Jets have been eliminated from playoff contention.
winnipegjets,lx74itf,2024-11-14 21:41:53,Jets played a half slurp behind tonight.
winnipegjets,lx74f77,2024-11-14 21:41:20,The Bolts were rested and ready for us. The Jets looked like they were skating in quicksand all night getting beaten to pucks consistently. Oh well can't be too mad they have been playing great and were due for a weak game. Onto the next game!
winnipegjets,lx74rpf,2024-11-14 21:43:16,I know we were due for a dud given the circumstances but Comrie deserved better. Dude made some 10 bell saves tonight.
winnipegjets,lx74muz,2024-11-14 21:42:30,Teams with blue and white as their only colours man. Tough to beat
winnipegjets,lx76rze,2024-11-14 21:54:49,I can live with 80-2.
winnipegjets,lx74pjj,2024-11-14 21:42:56,Poor Comrie
winnipegjets,lx74wmi,2024-11-14 21:44:04,Let’s rebound against the Panthers. I believe in the boys and Helle will be ready. Should be a great home and home against the Stanley Cup champs.
winnipegjets,lx74o2s,2024-11-14 21:42:42,Can't win 'em all.
winnipegjets,lx74sqp,2024-11-14 21:43:27,What 6 days of rest and prep against the best team does for a mf
winnipegjets,lx74w8e,2024-11-14 21:44:00,Wait the Jets can actually lose games? How is that even possible. Oh well another 8 game win streak coming up.
winnipegjets,lx7bb56,2024-11-14 22:21:22,How dare Tampa steal the only light from Toronto's season
winnipegjets,lx7fg12,2024-11-14 22:45:32,What's even more fucked up than anything Wild win the next game they'll be 3 points behind us after a historic start same amount of games.  Even when you create history Central right now is like YOINK
winnipegjets,lx74gjp,2024-11-14 21:41:32,Rip to the dude who made their first bet on a game today
winnipegjets,lx7966v,2024-11-14 22:08:44,They had six days off to rest and prepare for us and we came off playing the Rangers. It started out sloppy but Calmly kept us in it and we rebounded nicely. Hard to be upset with that.
winnipegjets,lx757vo,2024-11-14 21:45:50,Oh well still #1 in the league by a few points.
winnipegjets,lx752rq,2024-11-14 21:45:02,Panthers got blown out even worse than us.  It happens.  Onward!   (what the fuck were those powerplays though I mean really)
winnipegjets,lx74l8u,2024-11-14 21:42:15,That was about of bad as game as you can have luckily you can have one of those when you have a 7 game winning streak.Only thing to keep on eye on from this game is the PP imo. Tampa neutralized is so well it looked like Brad Lauer was behind the bench again
winnipegjets,lx75boi,2024-11-14 21:46:28,Well I kinda expected a loss sooner or later we couldn’t win forever. Hopefully we bounce back quickly against Florida
winnipegjets,lx75nry,2024-11-14 21:48:23,Can't win them all but they're back to back champions for a reason when they adapted to the last game both teams played with poor execution on damn near every play on top of that. Missed wide open passes and whiffed pucks all night. Would at least like to make it a competitive one somewhat but didn't even get that. Move on to the next one because the current Champions in a home and home is going to be one the Jets will definitely need to be 100% ready for.
winnipegjets,lx7n2by,2024-11-14 23:33:05,Cons: \- They Lost. \- The Reffing sucked. \- No Power Play Goals \- The Jets played sluggish vs a well rested team. Pro:s \- They were going to lose again sometime. \- The Reffing sucked both ways. There was missed calls suspect calls etc. Arguably the Jets maybe got the better of the calls. \- Comrie looked really good - although if he's constantly getting beat up high that may be worrisome. \- That Hot mic. That was amazing.
winnipegjets,lx79qet,2024-11-14 22:12:05,Even a God can bleed
winnipegjets,lx7bs8j,2024-11-14 22:24:12,I was hoping for 21-1.https://preview.redd.it/jibu2e7whz0e1.jpeg?width=336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7508c60e8bb99f436a428815f3355ddae825e23e
winnipegjets,lx7bx88,2024-11-14 22:25:01,For a guy who doesn’t swear Scheifele sure told the ref to wake the fuck up in the first.  Lol
winnipegjets,lx767pk,2024-11-14 21:51:33,The ice in Tampa looked really soft and the boys looked gassed. I’m guessing a little bit of jet lag plus slow ice played a role in their flat start to the game.

winnipegjets,lx7drjp,2024-11-14 22:35:45,So now we're 27th in the Power Rankings!
winnipegjets,lx75x2i,2024-11-14 21:49:51,Stray thoughts: \- Comrie with a full game's worth of great saves on high danger shots and that was before that final save he made on Kucherov - holy shit! Good for him. \- Reffing was suspect and unilaterally. Jets got away with stuff Tampa got away with stuff the game got out of hand physically and then a bunch of oddball penalties at the end. \- That last Nino penalty gave us the sequence of Comrie's wild save on Kucherov leading to Connor's shorthanded manoeuvring net drive and I enjoyed that sequence. \- Scheifele plays much worse when he's pissed imo. They rattled him and I think he was right to be rattled but it doesn't translate into anything positive for him... just gets clumsier and stiffer all at once. \- Namestnikov I like that guy. \- Jets were SOLVED. Tampa unraveled the neutral zone play. So 15-2 and with a real stinker in the books here... what's the response? Good to have this happen early. \- It's funny I'm as agitated about this loss as any in the final Maurice years when we lost a heck of a lot more. Why? Beats me. This team's been nasty at an unprecedented level and I'm sad they've lost 2 of 17 games. \- Florida games matter. Hope they're competitive and not like this one. \- We beat Tampa early and we lose tonight. They made their adjustments and it showed. We know this story. The games moving onward from here begin a second litmus test. \- Good luck team.

winnipegjets,lx786f3,2024-11-14 22:02:56,I thought Tampa played well more so than the Jets played poorly. It’s comforting to know that we’ve had some pushback in both of our losses and that we can get that kind of performance out of our backup goalie
winnipegjets,lx7ah5e,2024-11-14 22:16:25,We’re still number 1 and that’s what matters
winnipegjets,lx7c6p0,2024-11-14 22:26:32,I am very upset you are not going 81-1.Are you the favorites to win the West despite the loss?

winnipegjets,lx79ny2,2024-11-14 22:11:40,I mean can’t even be mad about it given the start we’ve had

winnipegjets,lx75xq4,2024-11-14 21:49:57,This game was such a blast ftom the past. Then again I always feel that we play like shit whenever media hypes us up big way. Anyhow I hope Arniel rights the ship.
winnipegjets,lx74ko5,2024-11-14 21:42:10,Damn media was spending waaaaay too much attention to us and jinxed us.
winnipegjets,lx77inn,2024-11-14 21:59:06,Had to work late so missed it oh well
winnipegjets,lx7otzm,2024-11-14 23:45:08,According to Ken Wiebe Miller told Fleury to switch. Daaaamn
winnipegjets,lx74guz,2024-11-14 21:41:35,It’s not that we lost it’s the way we lost.  The Jets played for maybe 10 minutes that game.  It was really frustrating to watch.
winnipegjets,lx7cdvo,2024-11-14 22:27:39,Even if they don’t win another game this season they have more wins than 1980-81. 
winnipegjets,lx74opz,2024-11-14 21:42:48,They're cheering like they won the cup.  I'm all for it. Jets are a powerhouse. Comrie let in a few that cost us but made some amazing saves also. Could've used some more solid goals or better defense to not have given up the lead in the first place.  Jets are still first place and only team to be 15-2. so . Fuck yeah.
winnipegjets,lx77n5s,2024-11-14 21:59:49,Man I haven't seen anything that sloppy since a bangsbro video.  It happens on to the next one.
winnipegjets,lx7gv9r,2024-11-14 22:53:56,So how bad was it? I was working so I couldn't catch it but I heard 1st period was absolute ass.

winnipegjets,lx782ql,2024-11-14 22:02:20,new drinking game: take a shot every time scheifele throws a blind pass

winnipegjets,lx7dfdv,2024-11-14 22:33:53,Wtf is this slurp shit pls someone tell me!?
winnipegjets,lx77z4x,2024-11-14 22:01:44,Agree but that being said I thought Coms was pretty solid between the pipes !
winnipegjets,lx79v7r,2024-11-14 22:12:52,Holy shit Tampa is boring to watch though. That game sucked lol.
winnipegjets,lx752et,2024-11-14 21:44:59,Yeah it really sucks when a team doesn’t show up for their backup.  This game isn’t on Comrie at all.
winnipegjets,lx7to81,2024-11-15 00:20:14,For a team that historically plays up to their backup (Brossoit is the perfect example). I would've liked for a better outcome for Coms.
winnipegjets,lx754qo,2024-11-14 21:45:21,He played so damn good
winnipegjets,lx7qpu3,2024-11-14 23:58:25,Bolts fan here. I hope you absolutely dismantle the Panthers.
winnipegjets,lx7ujl1,2024-11-15 00:26:54,Well you could. I mean no one has ever done it but it’s mathematically possible.
winnipegjets,lx7heti,2024-11-14 22:57:09,First streak was 7 this one was 8 i predict the next one is 9 games

winnipegjets,lx7g11z,2024-11-14 22:49:02,That puck seemed to be barely moving. Sweep!
winnipegjets,lx7c70d,2024-11-14 22:26:35,Disappointing.  Sloppy.  Forgetful.  Made Lowry seem like he has world class hands?  Remembering having hair?
winnipegjets,lx7d40f,2024-11-14 22:31:58,I think you are reading way too much into this game it was a rested team vs a team playing every other day for a month...
winnipegjets,lx7dmy7,2024-11-14 22:35:04,I think they (Tampa) played similar to how Colorado played and really reduced the Jets scoring opportunities.  That being said I felt the Jets were one bounce away from completely turning the game around.
winnipegjets,lx74ul0,2024-11-14 21:43:45,No power play goals? Get Lauer back in here!
winnipegjets,lx74qka,2024-11-14 21:43:05,I think we hit up Claude instead
winnipegjets,lx796ay,2024-11-14 22:08:45,Oilers Leafs hooooooow do people put this up and think it's accurate as all
winnipegjets,lx74pz3,2024-11-14 21:43:00,Yearly vacation in Florida.
winnipegjets,lx75bvy,2024-11-14 21:46:30,Tampa has been struggling recently I’m sure beating the team at the top of the standings convincingly felt good.
winnipegjets,lx9foa7,2024-11-15 08:39:54,It was Vasy's 300th win and made him the fastest to 300 wins in NHL history. That was the reason for the excessive celebration. Y'all have a great team and are having an amazing season. Good luck against Florida... hope you take this loss out on the Panthers.
winnipegjets,lx79dqy,2024-11-14 22:10:00,I think they are (mostly) joking.
winnipegjets,lx7crjv,2024-11-14 22:29:55,Trade Logan Stanley
winnipegjets,lx75caz,2024-11-14 21:46:34,You know what they say can't slurp em all.
winnipegjets,lx7e3b8,2024-11-14 22:37:39,Kevin Sawyer kept saying it for a couple games Vilardi makes an unreal goal and comments that he slurps it out of the air and it's been money since.
winnipegjets,lx87kvq,2024-11-15 02:17:22,It's the new meme. We are pivoting from Squirtle this year.
winnipegjets,lx78l77,2024-11-14 22:05:21,The Brick had some 5 bell saves in that game! I think playing Comrie more now will serve the Jets better coming into the home stretch and into the playoffs. Hellebuyck can't carry this team every night and he needs some time off to be refreshed and ready.
winnipegjets,lx7bjmp,2024-11-14 22:22:44,Clogging up the neutral zone and passing lanes is great defensive hockey but generally doesn't make for an exciting game. It's kinda like watching prime New Jersey Devils in the 80's and 90's playing the left wing lock style of hockey. They just held back and waited for their opponent to make a mistake to switch to offence.
winnipegjets,lxfm6it,2024-11-16 09:07:11,They should try it next year even just as a funny joke :^)
winnipegjets,lx7gimc,2024-11-14 22:51:50,Losing is something i'm only familiar with once a month right now
winnipegjets,lx878jo,2024-11-15 02:14:14,honestly what has he done for us lately (/s)
winnipegjets,lx7num0,2024-11-14 23:38:24,Yeah it was like he wasn't even there tonight.
winnipegjets,lx78qj7,2024-11-14 22:06:11,Ya slurp some ya lose some
winnipegjets,lx7vy9i,2024-11-15 00:37:48,“AND HE SLURPS IT RIGHT UP AND JUST TUCKS IT”
winnipegjets,lx7ewq3,2024-11-14 22:42:30,Lol alright thank you!
winnipegjets,lx7g6yi,2024-11-14 22:49:59,Not to mention he will undoubtedly play 4 games at the 4 Nations Faceoff when most other goalies will be resting.The more games Comrie plays before the all-star break the better.
winnipegjets,lx7glqi,2024-11-14 22:52:22,100% agree!
winnipegjets,lx6gdn9,2024-11-14 19:25:45,I was talking with one of them (several are from Brandon I guess)He said they get them from China. Probably temu or Alibaba. I think he said still like $200.
winnipegjets,lx6gex1,2024-11-14 19:25:57,No clue but love seeing them in the crowd!
winnipegjets,lx71qvs,2024-11-14 21:25:58,TNSE should sell these for the playoffs!

winnipegjets,lx7pp5y,2024-11-14 23:51:12,DUDE!I saw these guys at Amalie this evening and literally came here looking for pictures of them. Those helmets looked freaking awesome in person.
winnipegjets,lx6mkd1,2024-11-14 20:00:12,There’s a couple of options on Amazon.

winnipegjets,lxagf5s,2024-11-15 11:53:12,My guess is that the helmets will accompany these fine gentlemen on the way from Tampa to Miami for Saturday's game.  That's where you will find them.

winnipegjets,lx66bav,2024-11-14 18:29:58,lol 102.3 PDO isn’t even that high. They say that PDO regresses to around 1.000. Well league average sv% is .901. Nobody should be surprised if Helle puts up a .924 season long sv% so 102.3 is perfectly within ‘normal’ PDO range for the Jets.

winnipegjets,lx68eno,2024-11-14 18:41:29,Yeah at some point guys need to admit that maybe analytics don’t paint the whole picture. It’s not just some fluke that a team manages to go 15-1 and do something no other team has been able to do in the history of the nhl
winnipegjets,lx60z6q,2024-11-14 18:01:08,There's some point to it.  Our schedule has been 30th easiest.  We lucked out against Minnesota with a face off goal with 3 seconds left.  We lucked our against Chicago with a goal one minute left to send it to overtime.  We lucked out with Avs getting lucky bounces we coils clear.  Just until then start planning the parade.  
winnipegjets,lx677jc,2024-11-14 18:34:53,Exactly. You can’t assume league average goaltending when you have the best goaltender in the world
winnipegjets,lx69ye7,2024-11-14 18:50:07,Canucks also sustained around that pdo for the entire season last year
winnipegjets,lx5tkq6,2024-11-14 17:22:25,Goal difference.
winnipegjets,lx624lu,2024-11-14 18:07:20,You misspelled d-e-s-t-I-n-y !! We have caught the favour of the hockey gods and there’s NO defence against that ;)
winnipegjets,lx6ei1j,2024-11-14 19:15:18,Those goals weren't the result of luck. A good team finds ways to win. The Jets did just that in those games. Luck had nothing to do with it.
winnipegjets,lx5ui3c,2024-11-14 17:27:12,(It’s +39 now)
winnipegjets,lx66k9y,2024-11-14 18:31:19,Thanks!
winnipegjets,lx4h5ma,2024-11-14 13:15:17,Runs about 17 minutes long. Good insight from the bench boss as to why this group isn't getting too high from their 15-1-0 start. Some really interesting remarks throughout the conversation.
winnipegjets,lx417s9,2024-11-14 11:54:30,I'm going to keep this post up but going further these can be shared in the game day thread or off day threads. Being excited about the team is great but we don't need a post every four hours with a different shower thought of the team.
winnipegjets,lx3whmw,2024-11-14 11:30:19,One of the analysts from either TSN or Sportsnet gave a hint the other day saying they have heard there isn’t a long term relationship with Nik in our future. It was a female analyst that much I remember. Not saying it’s true but I did hear that.
winnipegjets,lx4d4it,2024-11-14 12:54:54,Yeah I love Ehlers and I don't know he's 28 and it feels like we've never really appreciated how good he is nor utilized him properly. The fact that it took this long for him to see the first powerplay unit is frankly embarrassing.I feel like the best situation for *him* is for us to actually pull off a run this year then going somewhere where he's recognized as the driver of play he is because I don't know what he has to do for that to happen here and he's likely only got a few more seasons at this level.For what it's worth I *do* think we've been doing a better job of using him this year but as far as a separation goes I can definitely see the appeal from the org perspective of freeing up that cap space for the younger guys and I can see the appeal from Ehlers' perspective of the grass potentially being greener elsewhere. I'm assuming that's why Chevy's not focusing on him as part of the longterm plan. Now all that said I know it makes sense if we don't have an extension for him but I'm going to be fucking heartbroken if we trade him before the playoffs.
winnipegjets,lx4ai46,2024-11-14 12:41:47,Think it comes down to money. Jets will need to decide who to keep from Vilardi Ehlers Perfetti Iafallo Appleton Namestnikov with the 1st 3 listed being able to demand the highest salaries.Then there is also Pionk and Sandberg who need new contracts as well.My guess is they focus on Vilardi and Sandberg. They do have at least 2 forwards and 1 healthy D ready to make the jump to the NHL (not counting Ville).
winnipegjets,lx42a2v,2024-11-14 11:59:54,As a Jets fan I desperately want him to stay.. but as a fan of him as a player I think he is brutally underutilized here and could be a true star player on another team that actually appreciates him.
winnipegjets,lx45d7r,2024-11-14 12:15:47,We've had extended periods where Ehlers is the best forward on the team. I'll be very sad if he leaves
winnipegjets,lx44k8d,2024-11-14 12:11:40,Garret hohl posted October 27th on Twitter Ehlers at 5v5 +102 for his career while Connor is -11.
winnipegjets,lx46r1t,2024-11-14 12:22:50,This guys on a tear holy
winnipegjets,lx4btvt,2024-11-14 12:48:26,This is spot on… I’ve always felt that way about Nik…. He’s one of the most exciting players in the whole league but has neve4 gotten first line ice time… Very bizarre… hopefully they will lock him up long term… letting him go would be a catastrophic mistake….
winnipegjets,lx4gs2v,2024-11-14 13:13:23,Ehlers is going to end up in Carolina and be one of their best top 6 forwards if we let him go. He's the type of player the Canes love
winnipegjets,lx4k7z9,2024-11-14 13:30:41,Wonder if age is the crux that held front office back. Ehlers will be 29 in a few months probably wants a 5 or 6 year deal. Think in Ehlers case is the Jets basically handcuffed themselves during his prime years. Instead of unleashing him and just living with the 1 bad mistake he makes and being happy about the 4 great plays he makes a game.
winnipegjets,lx4urem,2024-11-14 14:24:14,https://i.redd.it/72xmqth94x0e1.gif
winnipegjets,lx3w029,2024-11-14 11:27:50,I love Ehlers and I want him to succeed but by God does he disappear in the playoffs. In my mind he is a good player flirting with being great but needs to prove he can make an impact in the postseason.
winnipegjets,lx4hty4,2024-11-14 13:18:43,Nik going to get paid. He will get the 7-8 million for 6-7 years no question. He will be one of the day one signings for sure but I think the jets can't afford him and everyone else. Let's just load up for this season and try a cup run.
winnipegjets,lx5ackz,2024-11-14 15:44:15,My favorite player on the team is Ehlers I notice him. :)
winnipegjets,lx63hnx,2024-11-14 18:14:38,If (when???) this team is without Ehlers only then will people truly appreciate how great of a player he is. Look at what just being on PP1 has done to his production. Imagine what he could do with an addition 2-3 minutes at 5v5. I would die a little inside if he leaves but I could hardly blame him
winnipegjets,lx4fhaw,2024-11-14 13:06:45,I think Ehlers stays.  I believe the best version of Ehlers is at 16 min/per game. I think u push the minutes and he would be more prone to an injury.I love Niky and would be sad to see him leave.GO JETS GO.
winnipegjets,lx50u60,2024-11-14 14:55:14,I agree but I would wonder why that is. Been a few coaches playing around same. I guess we're all smarter then them.  Sure my statement was speculative but that seems to be the trend in this sub.
winnipegjets,lx43yn6,2024-11-14 12:08:37,Loved watching him play with the Mooseheads.
winnipegjets,lx4v998,2024-11-14 14:26:43,He’ll sign! Can’t see him in any other uniform! He’s a jet!
winnipegjets,lx505u1,2024-11-14 14:51:49,Upvote for Ehlers love; downvote for Chevy doubt.
winnipegjets,lx5cx4q,2024-11-14 15:57:17,Love Ehlers but let's see how he does in the playoffs before we lock him up long term. He's kind of invisible come playoff time
winnipegjets,lx5ii82,2024-11-14 16:25:43,If Chevy was thinking of shopping him around don’t we think he’d be singing his praises? Could the Chevy interview just have been edited?
winnipegjets,lx65keh,2024-11-14 18:25:55,I absolutely agree! He needs to be locked down asap. Love Ehlers!
winnipegjets,lx9yswf,2024-11-15 10:25:40,Nikolaj Ehlers is the best skater on this team and when he’s gone we will miss him dearly.
winnipegjets,lxe0pw8,2024-11-16 00:11:28,Fun player hopefully we can make a deep run for what is likely his last year here. Seen a lot of comments asking what the hold up is on extending him when it is probably his choice and honestly all the power to him. He's about to be 29 and hitting UFA status for the first time he'd be foolish to not wait it out and see what offers are out there for him and the jets also need to keep their cap in a good spot with all the other younger players due for new contracts in the coming years (Vilardi+Samberg this summer and Perfetti+Connor the following)
winnipegjets,lx4zxac,2024-11-14 14:50:36,Fun Ehlers facts:* there is not one NHLer since 2007 who has more points AND less ice time * there is not one NHLer since 2007 who has a higher 5v5 goal differential AND less ice time
winnipegjets,lx3yy7i,2024-11-14 11:43:01,Not to be a downer but he’s definitely gonna leave.
winnipegjets,lx40tra,2024-11-14 11:52:31,I think with the future of this team and the prospects that are coming in it would be in the teams best interest to sell him while his value is still high. He's playing like a first liner right now and the return the Jets would get is very enticing.Ehlers wants top minutes and he can get those on a team that needs star players.
winnipegjets,lx40wom,2024-11-14 11:52:56,I believe it was Leah Hextall. She referred to stuff around the room that we don't hear/doesn't get relayed through the regular media channels and said don't expect Ehlers back.I think Ehlers scares a lot of old-school coaches and GMs. They think he's high risk. They seem indifferent to the high reward part of the Ehlers equation. But we've got piles of data going back many seasons that show Ehlers is way more valuable than he seems to get credit for. He consistently tilts the ice in the right direction. When he's on the ice the Jets outscore their opponents at 5v5 by a massive amount. 144-88 over the past 3 seasons. Kyle Connor over the same span is 158-160. So who's really high risk? Ehlers probably doesn't listen to coaches much either. They pull their hair out when he goes for a lap around the offensive zone instead of shoveling it into a corner and cycling it. But the results are pretty stark...Ehlers knows what he's doing out there. Let him cook.
winnipegjets,lx40nu6,2024-11-14 11:51:42,Leah Hextall said the same thing. She knew the reason but didn't want to say.
winnipegjets,lx3ymr8,2024-11-14 11:41:23,It wouldn't surprise me. It also wouldn't surprise that he is motivated a little at least by the possibilities that lie ahead of him at the end of this year and that he wants out of the Winnipeg. His success so far this year bodes well for him. I believe his tone has changed in interviews from years past and I get the impression from some of them that he wouldn't mind checking out his options at the end of the year.
winnipegjets,lx4fsmr,2024-11-14 13:08:21,I thought Bucky and Shief were gone too. I mean Chevy makes great deals happen so I'm keeping up hope he stays with us long term. You know what they say good things come in 3s.
winnipegjets,lx4esed,2024-11-14 13:03:16,Sadly I think you're right. And all those players are playing great. I agree with who you focus on but I would add Fetts because I think he is just starting to come into his game and is going to be very good. Anyway our future still looks bright. Go Jets Go!!!
winnipegjets,lx4nse1,2024-11-14 13:48:45,Maybe on a lower end team. Any good team would use him similar to how Winnipeg uses him.
winnipegjets,lx49qrh,2024-11-14 12:37:59,Me too. He's been my favorite player for a few years now. He is the most exciting player on the team. I love his passion. This is one of the reasons actually I posted this because I miss his passion that he used to do his interview with not loud boisterous passion but you knew he was being truthful and honest candid or sincere almost. Now his interviews are more hockey like.
winnipegjets,lx4dfj2,2024-11-14 12:56:26,/u/garret9's been beating that drum for a while but the org has just steadfastly refused to hear it
winnipegjets,lx4zaw7,2024-11-14 14:47:26,I hate that guy (Just for clarity sake: that’s @ 5v5)
winnipegjets,lx4a2fe,2024-11-14 12:39:36,Arnie is handling him well. PP1 time is good for him too.
winnipegjets,lx4djlh,2024-11-14 12:56:59,> but has neve4 gotten first line ice time… Very bizarre…oh no he did. remember last year when we lost our best goalscorer and then immediately went on a heater for a month and a half? guess what changed
winnipegjets,lx4dne1,2024-11-14 12:57:31,I've never understood it either. I've thought he's not a big guy but we have seen that he is tough. Maybe he is unpredictable at times but he produces consistently. I wonder how he gets along in the dressing room? I don't know. As I said I don't see why he hasn't gotten the respect to me he seems to deserve. He is getting more this year so that is great.
winnipegjets,lx4qhdc,2024-11-14 14:02:25,I feel like he'd fit in really well with the Avs speed too honestly as much as I would hate that
winnipegjets,lx486ts,2024-11-14 12:30:08,He seems to have hit another gear and I’m excited to see what he does this year.
winnipegjets,lx40vwp,2024-11-14 11:52:50,This is such a tired narrative the jets have had one year looking good in the playoffs every other year NOBODY has looked good not just Ehlers. It’s been a yearly tradition for the jets as a whole to collapse come playoff time but for some reason only Ehlers gets shit for it
winnipegjets,lx44s0k,2024-11-14 12:12:48,Ehlers is -3 at 5v5 in the playoffs Connor is -2.
winnipegjets,lx4z5ki,2024-11-14 14:46:42,Ehlers career 5v5 on playoffs -3* Connor -2* Scheifele -4* Lowry -7
winnipegjets,lx4trbi,2024-11-14 14:19:10,That’s a ridiculous statement with nothing to back it up. He’s been the most productive in games where he’s been on the ice for 16 minutes this year. In historically he’s never consistently gotten over 16 minutes/per game and still gotten injured so those are completely unrelatwd
winnipegjets,lx4zlz8,2024-11-14 14:48:59,His results in games where he plays more minutes are not worse performance wise and the injury bit is a little speculative for my liking
winnipegjets,lxe24ds,2024-11-16 00:24:34,Forgot to mention his usage not sure how much it actually bothers him but would have to think he'd like to go somewhere he can be used as a top line guy. With KC and Vilardi basically being locks on 55s wing he ain't getting it here.
winnipegjets,lx44n2u,2024-11-14 12:12:05,Is it worth the risk of losing him right before a cup push this spring based on how good the chemistry is looking right now though? Think about how big of an impact he is having on the PP this year.
winnipegjets,lx41vut,2024-11-14 11:57:53,You're right it was her. Nik turns the puck over too often on unforced errors. Regardless he's still a guy I would keep around for sure. His benefits outweigh his negatives for sure.
winnipegjets,lx69zyw,2024-11-14 18:50:21,I was going to say but then saw you said it — the fact they give ehlers limited minutes and see him as a liability defensively but lean so heavily on scheifele and Connor is absolutely mind boggling
winnipegjets,lx4yupr,2024-11-14 14:45:09,There is not a single player in the NHL since 2007 who both has more points AND less TOI. There is not a single player in the NHL since 2007 who has a higher 5v5 goal differential AND less 5v5 TOI.I’m not sure about that.
winnipegjets,lx4t060,2024-11-14 14:15:20,Not true he’d be used as an actual second liner minimum on basically any team in the league. He gets third line minutes here
winnipegjets,lx4tsd5,2024-11-14 14:19:19,Frustrating since it's nothing fancy just straight up out scoring the competition year after year
winnipegjets,lx5ek4p,2024-11-14 16:05:40,Boooo him
winnipegjets,lx4izv1,2024-11-14 13:24:33,How quickly I forget… I take it back… He seems like such a nice guy too maybe this will b3 his breakout year…. I feel like someone will pinch me and I’ll wake up to see the Jets in 12th place not 15-1 and leading the league in every friggin category….
winnipegjets,lx469mf,2024-11-14 12:20:22,I agree but this post is about Ehlers. He's not the only one. But he's a noticeable one.
winnipegjets,lx4d8rv,2024-11-14 12:55:30,> Think about how big of an impact he is having on the PP this year.[internally screaming at how it took literally all 6 fucking years of his contract for him to see pp1]
winnipegjets,lx44dou,2024-11-14 12:10:44,Just look at the NHL Top 50 forwards in Giveaways/60 over the past few years. Ehlers is 45th (min 100 gp) and basically the whole list is guys you'd love to have on your team. Pastrnak Kucherov Marchand Panarin Tkachuk Kaprizov McDavid MacKinnon Aho Crosby Stutzle Eichel Verhaeghe then Ehlers.
winnipegjets,lx4a3ty,2024-11-14 12:39:48,"There's a disparity in standards here. He ""turns the puck over too much"" is nonsense when we saw the top line after connor's return completely incapable of carrying the puck into the ozone. The amount of times KC slowed down at the line and passed the puck directly to the other team are too much to count. Because Ehlers does it in the ozone with a backhand pass that (when it works) is exactly what makes him so lethal. And this year he is even better in all aspects. If we let him go I am absolutely done with this team."
winnipegjets,lx48lfy,2024-11-14 12:32:10,"No he does not turn the puck over too often. That fallacy has to stop and of course you'd keep him around. Who would not want Nikolaj Ehlers on their team. I'm afraid we are going to see how much we under valued him at the end of the year come contract time.  BTW you would ""keep him around""  sounds like you don't value him too highly."
winnipegjets,lx5ev6m,2024-11-14 16:07:15,I like that you hone in on giveaways sure they’re bad. But the Jets outscore the other team heavily with Ehlers but get outscored with Connor. So the turnovers ultimately result in…. nothing?
winnipegjets,lx4jgya,2024-11-14 13:26:56,hahaha yeah it's hard to complain about anything right now this is unrealreally hard to advocate for *changing* anything too i'm going to be heartbroken if we can't get an extension done and he ends up a deadline trade
winnipegjets,lx6a58j,2024-11-14 18:51:09,It’s almost like highly offensive guys who have the puck a lot and have to make plays under pressure have more turnovers
winnipegjets,lx4k6u4,2024-11-14 13:30:31,Have to hand it to Chevy… toughest market in the league and his latest moves have all been golden… Thanks PLD for the gift that keeps on giving…
winnipegjets,lx3d8t2,2024-11-14 09:47:31,Good teams are good teams because they outperform their expected stats. It's a useful stat but it doesn't mean anything concrete unless you can finish your chances.
winnipegjets,lx3i1xd,2024-11-14 10:14:20,We don't... Just keep quiet and keep betting on the Jets while the odds are favourable. Ive had a couple free McDoubles thanks to the boys.
winnipegjets,lx3hboh,2024-11-14 10:10:20,A power ranking is by definition an alternate sorting of the teams in a league based on something besides points. Ranking by goal differential is also a form of power ranking. Moneypuck is using other things and doesn't weigh goal differential too heavily but puts the emphasis on a bunch of underlying stats where the Jets aren't as dominant.
winnipegjets,lx3t6pw,2024-11-14 11:13:08,Who cares? Leave this garbage to the gamblers. Wins is all I care about.
winnipegjets,lx4qabk,2024-11-14 14:01:24,Do all the power rankings you want We’re still in first place overall With a +39Goal diff I’d rather be in first place Than first place in the power rankings
winnipegjets,lx3h0lq,2024-11-14 10:08:39,Stop listening to Moneypuck or anyone's power rankings? It's highly subjective.The only objective measure is who is ACTUALLY in first place.
winnipegjets,lx39h9y,2024-11-14 09:25:26,Statistics can prove anything if you want them to.
winnipegjets,lx3ahyw,2024-11-14 09:31:30,It’s an analytics sight and the Jets don’t have the best underlying numbers in the league. Who cares anyways all this nonsense “omfg why doesn’t anyone like us” is so cringe
winnipegjets,lx41nzw,2024-11-14 11:56:46,Because they put a lot and I mean a lot of it based off 2 things.  The number of pucks you direct to the net whether you hit the net or not and what your save percentage is.   If your not high on Fenwick you are bad if you are high on save percentage you are relying on your goalie too much.  They are also saying we score too much on the PP which is likely true but we are also scoring a lot as well
winnipegjets,lx3btem,2024-11-14 09:39:19,The reason for this ranking is because it’s designed to account for unsustainable save%. The reason the Jets break the model is because our save% has proven to be sustainable for a long time. Our shooting% isn’t even that high.
winnipegjets,lx3p59i,2024-11-14 10:51:56,None of these “advanced stat” models incorporate garbage time playing with a lead from behind injuries TOI/AVG TOI Back to backs starting goalie line blenders ect… nobody will ever have a perfect model. There are simply too many intangible variables. Everyone is trying to make a non-subjective stat but there is simply no such thing.That’s why it’s more fun to watch the games than it is to watch the game sheet.
winnipegjets,lx3ylu6,2024-11-14 11:41:15,Because the computers can’t actually watch the game duh
winnipegjets,lx4411o,2024-11-14 12:08:57,You would think that the win/loss would affect power rankings more than they do.
winnipegjets,lx3mnh8,2024-11-14 10:38:54,Just comparing the Jets numbers vs LA ranked one above them makes me wonder how all those numbers are weighted. The Jets have better numbers in nearly every category shown there yet ranked lower
winnipegjets,lx5dr1p,2024-11-14 16:01:30,Power Rankings in my opinion have always been based on more of a gut feeling and who has the most momentum.  When you reduce your Power Rankings to nothing but stats it doesn't take recency bias into account and really kind of eliminates the need for a week by week update.  Power Rankings that show a 15-1 Jets team in 10th place isn't a proper Power Ranking imo.
winnipegjets,lx5mtik,2024-11-14 16:47:46,Is this from 2021?
winnipegjets,lx7xvbo,2024-11-15 00:53:10,Too much expected versus actual. Who the fuck cares about expected stats I say.
winnipegjets,lx412jo,2024-11-14 11:53:45,Thata) stats can't capture the whole picture and thatb) there is more luck involved in professional sports than most people are comfortable with (especially hockey) andc) The Jets have had more than their share of luck (in addition to being very good) and their record doesn't fully reflect how well they've actually played
winnipegjets,lx3tq15,2024-11-14 11:15:58,Power rankings are horse shit. That's what it means. There is no calculator for heart and grit throughout a season.
winnipegjets,lx3ws51,2024-11-14 11:31:50,Looks like it’s sorted by *Power Score*. How do they assess that? 
winnipegjets,lx3x9wt,2024-11-14 11:34:25,The 22/23 Bruins is how you reconcile that top of the league seemed like the team of destiny wiped out by Florida in the 1st Round. Long story short metrics in hockey are kinda useless.
winnipegjets,lx3jozj,2024-11-14 10:23:15,I think we reconcile this by realizing that data can be reorganized to present any conclusion. I see a model that is obviously broken here and needs to be revised. Analytics should always be a tool to help assessment and not the ultimate decision maker.
winnipegjets,lx8b0ts,2024-11-15 02:49:31,Do you think the Jets will continue to win at the same clip?
winnipegjets,lx3n8dy,2024-11-14 10:41:56,In other words these are areas the Jets need to work on to become even better.Time to review the tape.
winnipegjets,lx7ydka,2024-11-15 00:57:12,Big Dubs are all that count!
winnipegjets,lx8bo5f,2024-11-15 02:55:36,I’d rather be both. Have the wins and a good chance of having the good times still going.
winnipegjets,lx4ld02,2024-11-14 13:36:27,My only use for Moneypuck is those beautiful graphical standings.
winnipegjets,lx3al75,2024-11-14 09:32:02,40% of all people know that
winnipegjets,lx3qd7q,2024-11-14 10:58:19,Statistics are not the problem but the untrained eye can misinterpret them or fail to see possible other explanations.
winnipegjets,lx3wges,2024-11-14 11:30:09,100% of statistics are made up 70% of the time
winnipegjets,lx3bsce,2024-11-14 09:39:08,"People are seriously complaining about the lack of positive Jets coverage as well. I'm pretty sure I've seen more coverage of us in the last week than I've seen in the 6 years since our 2018 playoff run.It's so tiring seeing the posts on r/hockey from Jets fans with ""fuck the haterssss"" like wtf are people smoking if they think we are genuinely hated by any fanbase outside of Minnesota and maybe Toronto."
winnipegjets,lx3lmyv,2024-11-14 10:33:33,it's insane that these keep getting posted lol
winnipegjets,lx4doo5,2024-11-14 12:57:42,I only care that I am entertained. It is the actual game and the unfolding play I love.
winnipegjets,lx3uu5r,2024-11-14 11:21:49,Why is this interpreted as why don’t people like us???I just wanted how these two stats can be so different nothing about the Jets.  I could have done the same thing with why the Oilers are so high but their goal differential is -7.
winnipegjets,lx3mcdx,2024-11-14 10:37:16,think this could also be true for our powerplay performance at the moment tbh (not the sustainable for a long time bit tho lol)
winnipegjets,lx8bqzo,2024-11-15 02:56:22,Jets sh% relative to shot quality is 50% higher than any team since 2007…
winnipegjets,lx8bv6r,2024-11-15 02:57:29,Wait lots of models adjust for score effects schedule linemates and that.
winnipegjets,lx8bwsi,2024-11-15 02:57:56,Is watching the game the power list or the goal differential list?
winnipegjets,lx8byv2,2024-11-15 02:58:26,That defeats the purpose to find team value beyond wins and loses.
winnipegjets,lx8cin3,2024-11-15 03:03:44,Why? The model also weights recent performance more than less recent. Also why is it wrong to dock points if there are signals that the team is not as good as its record?
winnipegjets,lx8ck4q,2024-11-15 03:04:08,People who want to keep on winning and aren’t just satisfied with previously winning.
winnipegjets,lx4bjgk,2024-11-14 12:46:59,“Luck” should even out over a reasonable sample but there are other factors (some related to “luck”) such as injuries illness etc. that cannot be accounted for
winnipegjets,lx8c7ys,2024-11-15 03:00:52,But the goal differential has heart and grit?
winnipegjets,lx8cb9v,2024-11-15 03:01:42,Their website lists more details but basically a weighting of all the stats listed in the columns but they take some of last years data when the sample is sub 20 games.
winnipegjets,lx8cdhh,2024-11-15 03:02:19,Shot metrics literally exist because more often than not they outperform goal differential in who wins.
winnipegjets,lx8cet8,2024-11-15 03:02:42,What is it that is broken?
winnipegjets,lx3xxnu,2024-11-14 11:37:48,"Maybe? I don't know how much they're weighting unblocked shot attempts (Fenwick) but they don't appear to be adjusting for score effects (adjusted brings the Jets over 50%). The ""Share of PP Time"" stat doesn't seem too useful. The Jets are +10 in net penalty differential and crushing it on the powerplay. If the Jets PP% and PK% were equal they'd have a large positive percentage in this stat...so it seems they're getting downranked for converting at 42% vs. the opposition 18.4% on special teams."
winnipegjets,lx3d5jy,2024-11-14 09:47:00,60% of the time it works everytime 
winnipegjets,lx3l3q4,2024-11-14 10:30:43,you can come up with statistics to prove anything Kent. Forfty percent of all people know that.
winnipegjets,lx3op3z,2024-11-14 10:49:35,Oh man preach. We’re gonna be hated as a fanbase before the Christmas break. Never seen such an example of little brother syndrome before. We should be better than that.
winnipegjets,lx3lw2o,2024-11-14 10:34:54,never seen the official NHL account ESPN br\_open ice etc. post about us more haha
winnipegjets,lx3bybk,2024-11-14 09:40:07,Yea those people are making us disliked with their constant threads bitching and moaning lol
winnipegjets,lx8bmdf,2024-11-15 02:55:10,It was nearly two decades ago that Corsi was found to predict the remainder of the season at the 25 50 and 75 games better than goal differential wins or standings points.This wasn’t for predictive modelling but to show how there are signals or factors that are more telling of a team’s true value than their outcomes.Since then analysts have incorporated more than just shot volume to create actual predictive models.So that’s why.
winnipegjets,lx3szfh,2024-11-14 11:12:05,Yeah I wouldn’t expect the power play to operate at 50% or whatever it has been but I don’t think that some regression would cost us as many standing points as some people think. I would argue that our expected goals and goals against numbers are actually slightly depressed. There have been half a dozen games where the Jets just blew the doors off the other team so score effects took over and the opposing team racked up shot attempts and a few soft goals that may not have been there if the game was closer.
winnipegjets,lx963qu,2024-11-15 07:38:05,Ok but the chart in question doesn’t say that. It just says that shooting% is 11.95% which is high but not ridiculously so.
winnipegjets,lx8c4xq,2024-11-15 03:00:04,You’d be surprised.Just given how often teams win and lose it’s reasonable to expect the true best team in the league misses the playoffs every 50 years. Which sure is rare but that’s the BEST team lol.
winnipegjets,lx4klra,2024-11-14 13:32:37,But only if you give 110%…
winnipegjets,lx3ckiy,2024-11-14 09:43:40,"You mean you **don't** like seeing thread after thread of Jets fans who don't understand analytics in the slightest complaining that Moneypuck/Dom/whoever is ""disrespecting"" the Jets?Wow man where's your team spirit? /s"
winnipegjets,lx3yihe,2024-11-14 11:40:47,definitely! have been speculating that our xG should actually regress to the mean by improving
winnipegjets,lx32qfz,2024-11-14 08:43:47,As a somewhat contrary point of view I do love the record-breaking aspects of our start.  The NHL has been around for over 100 years and this team is actually shattering the record for most points after X games.  Those types of records will live on for many years if not decades.Obviously the behind-the-scenes work that the franchise has put into this has led to this amazing start but when we look back at this years from now and see this start etched into the historic records of the NHL it is something to be proud of.Some grumpy fans will dismiss this if it doesn’t lead to playoff success. To those people do you not watch games from October to April and exact any enjoyment from it or do you just watch the playoffs?If the Jets win their division (which they have never done in their history of the NHL) and the Presidents’ Trophy (also never done) that would be a noteworthy feat for this franchise and even if it doesn’t lead to playoff success I won’t be dismissing these regular season accomplishments.Now it’s not all about the end result of wins and losses.  I am thoroughly enjoying the elevated play of this entire team and just appreciate how this team has come together. I hope this streak continues… it is very fun!
winnipegjets,lx3bd9t,2024-11-14 09:36:41,To an extent I agree but if the Jets win the Presidents’ Trophy we should celebrate that. I understand why the Stanley Cup is the ultimate goal and why everyone says ‘we haven’t won anything until we win the Cup’ but one thing that Soccer gets right in Europe is that they properly celebrate having excellent regular seasons.
winnipegjets,lx2u16c,2024-11-14 07:44:27,As much as i like the accolades it dont mean shit if we cant transfer this amazing run into a deep playoff push I am excited but also nervous
winnipegjets,lx36k6h,2024-11-14 09:07:48,I hate the narrative that the jets are playoff chokers and i genuinely believe this team is different from that of two years ago and last year. the growth is evident and the progress is tremendous. that being said the regular season is for making the playoffs selling tickets and getting everything fine tuned. it separates the weak from the good and the jets were always going to be good. once the playoffs start the great separates from the good and in the nhl especially luck and momentum are huge factors. the way they’ve been playing is indicative of a deep play off run but until that time comes i’m enjoying the positive media attention our beautiful city and club is receiving and the absolute humbling we are giving to other teams. individual accolades will come with this kinda winning to our players. but as a collective the team the city the province for that to be truly united we must win in the playoffs and win in the stanley cup. until then heads down onto the next.
winnipegjets,lx4r7fp,2024-11-14 14:06:06,Man I’m tired of seeing ppl say our team need to make it past 1st round!! Isn’t the regular season part of the journey to the playoffs?!No one expected the team to be anywhere near this kind of production. As I’ve said before hater gonna hate.. and there are haters. Don’t fool yourself.They are WAITING for the next loss and will make it known we are frauds.Go Jets Go
winnipegjets,lx3glpm,2024-11-14 10:06:21,Usually I'd agree with your take but what we're seeing at the start of this season is special. We should cherish these moments we're breaking NHL records and it's being done by a team in Winnipeg.
winnipegjets,lx3rqgy,2024-11-14 11:05:31,"I went through this before with the Winnipeg ICE which I was a season ticket holder for. They were a phenomenal team at one point in 2021 they were 21-1. They had a similar super hot start in 2022. They had two great playoff runs... COVID wiped out the playoffs in their first two seasons but in 2022 they went to the conference final then in 2023 to the league final. But in both instances they couldn't quite get it done.Looking back on it the ICE were a phenomenal team and there are so many great memories I have of watching them. They had two long exciting playoff runs. But in the end I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some disappointment that they didn't win it all at least once.  I think the players would admit that too. The playoff losses don't negate regular season success but there's no denying that there is some impact there on a team's overall legacy. And it's the same thing with the Jets. We'll probably never see a regular season start like this in Winnipeg for the rest of our lives. So it does stand alone to some extent. But another early playoff exit would definitely detract from the team's legacy. In my view it would take a conference final appearance minimum for the Jets to properly live up to the regular season they've been having so far without having it feel like a massive disappointment.I mean if hockey was a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book and we were forced to choose between a dominant division champion that craps out in the second round of the playoffs or a wild card team that wins a cup I think we all know what we'd be choosing."
winnipegjets,lx3enfg,2024-11-14 09:55:27,Playoffs or bust. The Bruins set the all time regular season wins record but all anyone remembers is them blowing it in the first round against Florida. I am enjoying this crazy run so far and they are playing phenomenal hockey but bowing out in the first round again will taint whatever regular season success they have.
winnipegjets,lx4kumc,2024-11-14 13:33:52,I feel what you’re getting at but I feel like regular season success is way too played down in NA sports. Yes the Cup is and always will be the ultimate goal. No one should be building a regular season champ team. But with that said does that mean we shouldn’t enjoy the regular season? The end of last year definitely sucked but that season was still some of the most fun I’ve had as a Jets fan. The start of this year has been amazing. Literally no one else has done what this team has. Every team plays 82 games every year if those games don’t matter why do we even play them? I’m not saying we should just wave away playoff failures but I do think we should enjoy regular season success a bit more.

winnipegjets,lx38ry3,2024-11-14 09:21:16,100% agree. What the team has achieved so far is certainly worth being proud of. If we lack playoff success yes it will be disappointing. Yes other fanbases and the media will hand wave away our record breaking start as a fluke but I will be immensely proud of the work the boys did to set new records. End of the day this team is more fun and exciting to watch now than ever before. Journey before destination and the most important step the team can take is always the next one.  GJG 
winnipegjets,lx3jiwa,2024-11-14 10:22:20,">To those people do you not watch games from October to April and exact any enjoyment from it or do you just watch the playoffs?Yes exactly! I watch games to have a good time that game you can't be looking ahead or back... enjoy the moment. I'm a coach (not hockey) and players often will ask the instant one game is done ""Who do we play next?"" and my answer is always the same ""I don't know I was focused on this one let me check"" You don't win because of a single game it's a series of them and you need to prepare for each and take them one at a time."
winnipegjets,lx69cp0,2024-11-14 18:46:45,"""It is very fun!""Exactly.If following professional sports isn't done in the name of fun then what's the point?"
winnipegjets,lx33t36,2024-11-14 08:50:38,Pfff would you be equally satisfied/dissatisfied if the Jets were a 95 point bubble team that lost in the second round versus a Presidents Trophy Jets team that lost in the second round?Kinda weird that some fans have so little enjoyment over the 82 game regular season.
winnipegjets,lx2ubje,2024-11-14 07:46:34,I know. I love it. I understand the nerves but I believe we are legit a great team. The bones have been there for a a long while now. I think this is the year we aren't going to under achieve.
winnipegjets,lx31glq,2024-11-14 08:35:33,Every real Jet fan feels this way! Kinda scared if a wheel will fall off but loving the ride.

winnipegjets,lx391qu,2024-11-14 09:22:52,Did no one watch the Colorado series? They played insane. Never seen a team play with so much speed and aggression.We got clapped I don't think we choked.
winnipegjets,lx3gtbl,2024-11-14 10:07:31,If the team doesn’t have playoff success would this record be a fluke?  For those watching the games including other fan bases seeing their team against the Jets we do know that this has not been a fluke.  #1 offense… #1 defense… it’s actually pretty sick.  It definitely is well-earned… the team is truly playing amazing and it has been so great to watch.Living outside Winnipeg I was wondering if I should have invested the $250 SportsNet Plus package to watch the Jets this year.  Definitely glad I did!
winnipegjets,lx35kkw,2024-11-14 09:01:40,I guess my point wasn't clear. I love what the team is doing and am certainly not taking anything away from what they are doing. I was trying to make the point that even if we didn't have the record breaking start we did I still think we are on the right road to the Cup. A lot of people are on the band wagon and don't really understand why we are as good as we are and that we have been good for a long while...good but not successful I know. The road to success is a long one and this team has been at it for many years now but I think something clicked and here we are in this awesome ride.
winnipegjets,lx364wo,2024-11-14 09:05:12,Let me ask you this.  The Jets have had great starts in the two prior seasons but fell off massively in the second half.  Why do you think that was?While this start is even better than the past two seasons do you feel confident that the team won’t revert back to form like in the prior two seasons?
winnipegjets,lx3kqh3,2024-11-14 10:28:46,"Fell off massively in the second half?Last season 28 wins in the first 41 games 24 in the next 41......that's not a ""massive falloff"""
winnipegjets,lx38t6z,2024-11-14 09:21:28,That's the million dollar question. My opinion is that team chemistry and learning and then buying into Bones defensive style were what has been keeping us back. The team chemistry first. I think that speaks for itself for any fan. I believe that is totally sorted out now. Everyone in the organization is rowing in the same direction. Do you remember when you'd year Po Mo and then Bones talking about more shots and then Shief and KC would come out talking about not wasting shot opportunities on low % chances. We don't hear that anymore. Adam Lowry being our Captain has sinched our identity as well. Last year we fine tuned out D game at the expense of offense which challenged our offensive minded players and I think it took them a bit more time to buy in to the defense first and the offense will come from that. We heard it a lot over the last 2 or 3 years here but now we are seeing it consistently.So with this buy in and the fact that we are so deep will help with the winter blues we've suffered in the past.
winnipegjets,lx3o2ug,2024-11-14 10:46:21,On January 20 2024 the Jets were 30-10-4 the #1 ranked team in the league by point percentage.On March 30 2024 the Jets were 44-24-6 (having gone 14-14-2) dropping to third place in our division.  That was a massive screw-up that cost us playoff positioning.  While we rebounded with 8 straight wins we still had to play a tough Avs team (and we know how that went).Going #1 in the league and then going .500 hockey for 30 games IS a massive drop-off.
winnipegjets,lx3g8qq,2024-11-14 10:04:21,I’ll accept what you say as being good in theory and hope that there actually is an extended mindset change that will extend this success without a massive months long let-down.
winnipegjets,lx3p6vy,2024-11-14 10:52:10,Sure if you arbitrarily make the cutoff after we went 9 of 10 and right before a 5 game skid... I picked the halfway point of the season. I didn't shove that 5 game skid to one side to favour my point.
predators,lxtt4qc,2024-11-18 17:03:19,That’s our boy
predators,lxtwz21,2024-11-18 17:23:44,That’s my captain.
predators,lxtexzu,2024-11-18 15:51:40,There are obviously other iterations that can add up to the 95 points we need but I think its safe to say that 10 OT losses (we already have 3) and 95 points is a safe threshold to work around. Big takeaway… we don’t have the luxury of having injuries bad streaks or really anything.Edit:The lowest win% I could calculate in what I could consider “reasonable” was 0.555. This would translate to us going:35-18-10 (80 points)
predators,lxtgio4,2024-11-18 15:59:31,I think we could easily hit that but we have to find a way to sustain the flashes of good play the team has. If we could sustain and Saros stays healthy and playing as good as he is. We would be a scary wildcard.
predators,lxtjxvp,2024-11-18 16:16:44,I tend to look at the current standings over any projections. We are currently 5 back of the last WC spot. 5 points can be gained or lost in one week. Long term I am guessing colorado moves up and calgary moves down but who knows anything is possible in hockey. As long as we don't let the gap to Wild Card 1/2 grow we are still in striking distance (although I would much rather be leading the race for that spot than chasing it).
predators,lxtjotu,2024-11-18 16:15:28,So we can't lose more than 18 games and have less than 10 OT losses. Good times.
predators,lxtvt1v,2024-11-18 17:17:27,Saros absolutely torched us last night. Probably 4 times i thought canucks scored that mf stopped it. Was pissing me off lmao
predators,lxtkfwt,2024-11-18 16:19:14,For every loss under 35 we need to make that up by going into OT 2 times. 10 plus the 3 we have seemed like the edge of hope/illusion. I think the real magic number for us is the 36-19-8 mark. You get the idea though! MOAR GOLZ.

predators,lxsl5de,2024-11-18 13:21:25,That’s what happens when you go over 10 years without a lottery pick. Go through drafts from last 10 years and you see so many Fabbros and Tolvanens from other teams too. The Predators have to be the only franchise in all of pro sports to go 10 years without a top pick and have nothing to show for it either. It’s maddening.
predators,lxsiage,2024-11-18 13:07:00,To be completely fair we haven’t had a forward prospect that is considered to be a “Play Driver” because we never have a pick high enough to grab one of those guys. Guys like Jack Hughes Connor Bedard & Macklin Celebrini can drive play themselves so they can come up and are immediately effective regardless of the situationI think Kemell and Svechkov are really solid prospects but if you call them up and play them alongside Sissons how the hell are they gonna be effective? Those 2 won’t be able to elevate Sissons game because they aren’t “elite prospects”. They are pieces that can dominate if put in the proper positions to succeed. That’s always been the problem with this org
predators,lxsjjp1,2024-11-18 13:13:23,What team consistently picks forwards who pan out?
predators,lxsl9gr,2024-11-18 13:21:59,That still plays for us? Colton Sissons in 2012. The rest I still think are inconsistent and trying to find their place in the league or gone.

predators,lxsxai9,2024-11-18 14:22:09,Can you explain that spreadsheet a bit? I noticed that a player can be considered a hit for a team even if that player is no longer on that team. Example- Jack Eichel. Listed under Buffalo as a hit but they traded him. Are the stats paused once a player is traded or something?
predators,lxu4rcm,2024-11-18 18:06:17,David Legwand
predators,lxsvsan,2024-11-18 14:14:37,I get the top 10 argument and it is true but let’s not sit here and say if you don’t have a top 10 forward you’ll never amount to success. The Oilers have yet to win anything with Drai and McDavid. The Sabres drafted top 5 for many years and are still just as bad. The issue with us is that we can’t develop forwards. Look at Dallas’ Wyatt Johnston 23rd overall pick a star. Tomasino 24th overall pick benched and likely being waived/traded. I don’t think we have a talent problem we have an org problem. 
predators,lxsmf7l,2024-11-18 13:27:47,I hate this so much too. We lose in the first round so much lol then our last lottery pick we drafted a goalie and traded him away.
predators,lxt14sv,2024-11-18 14:41:31,Is that true? What qualifies as a top pick?
predators,lxsx6w5,2024-11-18 14:21:39,We've had chances. 2014 we took Fiala at 11 Detroit took Larkin at 15 Boston took Pastrnak at 25. The 2015 pick getting traded is hurting us as loaded as that draft was in round 1 even a late pick could have grabbed Aho before Carolina got him in round 2.2016 Fabbro went at 17 Tage Thompson at 27 Debrincat and Kyrou in round 2.Look at Dallas. Robertson Heintz and Stankoven all round 2 picks. The highest picks in their forward group are Duchene (Colorado #3) and Seguin (Boston #2) Carolina has 1 top 10 pick they've drafted on their roster and Svechnikov isn't exactly tearing up the league. I think he led in empty net goals last season. While I'd kill to get a top 10 play driving center it's no excuse to be this bad at scouting and developing forwards. Every first round pick seems to come up hot for half a season hit the sophomore slump then a season getting scratched and shuffled until being waived or traded. I didn't expect them to get lucky and find a hall of fame forward in round 3 but a legit top 6 scorer isn't a big ask
predators,lxsitt0,2024-11-18 13:09:43,I agree. I think if we’re out of the playoffs kemmel and svetchkov need to play with top guys. Playing with Colton sissons is a death wish for your career. Kemmel was a top 10 prospect though I think they are over cooking him. I think part of it is we devalue these guys by not letting them play  then make them sign shit bridge deals which may be a management strategy but it’s not creating good new players it’s ruining them
predators,lxskie6,2024-11-18 13:18:14,Florida Utah Dallas. Tampa bay. Bruins hurricanes. Ducks detroit and Chicago historically. We are elite at picking defensemen tho
predators,lxslmi7,2024-11-18 13:23:48,We’re great at d and goalie. We might be the best in the league.  I’m not sure if a Nashville drafted forward has even scored 30 wearing our jersey maybe arvy did
predators,lxsqayj,2024-11-18 13:47:18,I feel like on our team he’s a 40 point guy but if he went somewheee else he would score 30. Weren’t we gonna bench him the other night before Novak got hurt.
predators,lxtdte6,2024-11-18 15:46:02,A lot of the players on that list don’t play for the original team where they were drafted. Corey Perry for example was drafted by the ducks but hasn’t played for them in years.The sheet is trying to display how successful an org is at utilizing their picks to draft players. Success is determined by the length of the player’s career in the NHL (ie: how many of their picks end up with >800gp = hit) not how long the player stays with the organization that drafted them.Using your Eichel example he’s listed under Buffalo as a hit because Buffalo drafted him. He’s counted as a Buffalo draft success because he’s had a long career in the NHL.
predators,lxtjooa,2024-11-18 16:15:27,It’s true that the Oilers haven’t but I think we all agree we’d trade franchises with them in a heartbeat. You’re right that Preds can’t develop them but to their credit it’s just so much harder when you’re not picking high… ever
predators,lxtiuoq,2024-11-18 16:11:18,Top 10. seth jones was the last one he’s now a 30 year old veteran and the Preds had ONE actual playoff run in that whole time
predators,lxskppz,2024-11-18 13:19:16,I don’t mean to be rude but do you have any numbers to back that up or are you just naming teams who drafted some good forwards?
predators,lxtzmqg,2024-11-18 17:37:59,Dallas seems to pick towards well. One is in contention for rookie of the year now…
predators,lxsot3r,2024-11-18 13:39:46,RV got 34 held the Preds record for some time.
predators,lxsrsb4,2024-11-18 13:54:38,Hornqvist had a 30 goal season
predators,lxtls8q,2024-11-18 16:26:00,I agree. I think we’d be in a better position if we started seeing success in developing our young prospects. If we can’t develop Kemell Svech Wood etc into top talent everyone needs to be fired. 
predators,lxsl3nn,2024-11-18 13:21:10,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1seK-7d7czlbZ5MaFmTOiKI8JPSaLZRutR8SHzX_YfVI/htmlview#gid=248393585We are 20th for first round pick hit rate. That includes all the legendary d we have drafted. Couldn’t find it for just forwards but no one we have drafted in the first round has had elite production in a Nashville jersey not one because forsberg was a trade. Edit arvy was pretty solid but not elite and wasn’t a first rounder
predators,lxsozqc,2024-11-18 13:40:41,Fuck bortuzzo or whoever it was that cheap shotted him
predators,lxss0en,2024-11-18 13:55:44,I forgot we drafted him. Nice
predators,lxsl66u,2024-11-18 13:21:32,Very interesting thanks much
predators,lxsrijt,2024-11-18 13:53:16,If Weber and Josi are the legendary D you’re referring to they were both picked after the first round as well. It’s not necessarily where you draft but how you draft that matters.
predators,lxt7632,2024-11-18 15:12:11,They’re horrible at developing forwards though Paul Kariya held the single season goal record for over a decade before Arvidsson finally broke it with 34
predators,lxsru53,2024-11-18 13:54:53,I meant suter and Ellis as well but yea the data I found was just for first round
predators,lxsetk3,2024-11-18 12:49:35,Looks like he is getting about 10-13 per game which is consistent across seasons. He is one of three players on the roster with no goals and with 17 shots. He is an offensive player not giving any offense.I don’t know if there is any player in the roster that has been a product of a shitty situation than Tomasino over the years. Unfortunately other guys have taken their limited opportunities and are getting rewarded (ZLH Parsnips Sherwood last year as examples).He is typically a .5pg player and we could have used those 5 points in the games he dressed this year however he has a single point. Our team is also way out of sorts defensively and two of our biggest offenders of turnovers have been Fabbro and Tomasino. To be fair I haven’t looked at the turnover numbers in the last few games.
predators,lxsusco,2024-11-18 14:09:38,"Tomasino is looking like a guy who is about to be waived. He's getting that same treatment that Tolvanen and Fabbro received before they were gone. Always in and out of the line-up barely any minutes when they're out there first one out and into the press box on game day. What's surprising to me is that he looked really really good on the Pars - Evangelista line. That line was fast they created plays and I don't think they ever let a goal in against. I thought it was the best line on the ice for the 2-3 games before Vancouver. Reading up on it Brunette and Tomasino both said a few times that the issue last season was Tomasino's defense and that he wasn't skating hard and ""hounding pucks"". Brunette said he wanted him to be more relentless. Maybe Tomasino is picking up his skate a bit too early instead of diving into plays like he needs to. What really annoying me about that is that neither Marchessault nor Stamkos seem to be held to the same standard. Marchessault has been absolute garbage and Stamkos has been pretty weak 5v5. Marchessault has ZERO five on five points. ZERO. Yet his ass is in every single game while Tomasino sits. My main criticism of this team right now is that Brunette is giving the vets way to much leeway to ""figure it out"" at the expense of the rest of the team. I wouldn't be surprised to see Tomasino waived or given away as a result."
predators,lxsh2lz,2024-11-18 13:00:49,Because we are the worst organization at forward development in the nhl. Particularly with high picks
predators,lxsjldk,2024-11-18 13:13:37,Because coaching and culture. He will hit the waiver wire soon
predators,lxt7cf1,2024-11-18 15:13:05,Tomasino is a perfect candidate to go somewhere else and score 20 goals
predators,lxsumte,2024-11-18 14:08:51,Tolvanen comes to mind 
predators,lxsmy2w,2024-11-18 13:30:24,"I mean I get that his minutes are consistent with what he's had in the past but he's on a ""prove it"" deal and they aren't giving him the minutes to prove it.  Just don't love we aren't giving him more time."
predators,lxt2bvm,2024-11-18 14:47:34,I liked the kid line. I think we should keep rolling with it. I looked at Tomasino’s shots for the year and he has had 6 in high danger spots out of 17 total. He is getting into the interior maybe not as much as Bruno wants or whatever but he isn’t finishing either. It’s not that Tomasino is bad but I don’t know if Bruno knows what he is looking for in him outside of “just work harder”. I like the Marchessault comparison. If Marchessault was one of the kids he would have been in the press box  for someone to come up from MKE for a showing with Evangelista moved up to the 2 line (which maybe he should be at this point I hate seeing him buried down on 3).
predators,lxsv0sm,2024-11-18 14:10:48,Looking forward to seeing Tomasino become a 60 point player on some other team once we waive him
predators,lxsvitz,2024-11-18 14:13:18,
predators,lxsutlb,2024-11-18 14:09:48,Playing devils advocate… If he has proven he can be a .5ppg player at 12 min per game then why would we give him top 6 minutes when he has 0 goals and 1 assist as a known defensive/turnover liability? Who gets moved down/scratched so he can prove himself at 12-15 min per game?
predators,lxsww34,2024-11-18 14:20:08,I was hoping with Trotz we’d be able to develop more of our top prospects but we seem to be trending the same. We need to rid of any Poile influence in the org and completely revamp the FO heavily on scouting.

predators,lxruhob,2024-11-18 11:06:09,I think they clock these max speeds when he's going to cash a check
predators,lxrzcgm,2024-11-18 11:31:32,That OT rush he had a couple games ago was actually insane
predators,lxs1knk,2024-11-18 11:42:54,This is why Max speed isn't a good measure. 20+ bursts is a better indicator of the fastest players because it shows who is consistently hitting top speeds.
predators,lxs87hn,2024-11-18 12:16:34,I think he has been working with Forsberg.  Several times over the last couple games I've noticed him activating headhunter mode on the forcheck.  He full on bulldozed a guy against vancouver with speed to keep a puck in the zone and it worked.  The dude seems to be putting in actual effort to fit into the system and I'm here for it
predators,lxs0si4,2024-11-18 11:38:58,To be fair at the time he was skating downhill.
predators,lxsa184,2024-11-18 12:25:43,Watch him on the ice he is a good skater. Better than I thought he would be. Easy to get lulled into how he’s usually stationary when he’s scoring goals and thinking he can’t move.

predators,lxpxyf2,2024-11-18 01:40:09,You can take solace in whatever you want there are only four teams with a worse point total. They have not played a single game yet this season that makes them look like they could win a series against a playoff team. This is not a team that gets time to develop. They don't have an opening window they have a window that won't stay open on its own so it's being propped open with old disused household items. They are the second oldest team in the league *and they look like it* night in and night out. 5v5 is still miserable. The kids did not take a step Novak and Pars and Tommer all still get bullied night in and night out and if Juice didn't have an otherworldly first period Pars and Novak would've each given up a goal on completely unacceptable turnovers ten feet outside of the crease. Forgive me for not being ecstatic about a game where luck bailed out the mistakes. The mistakes persist luck does not.

predators,lxow0ye,2024-11-17 21:01:55,Im gonna go ahead and say the preds win this one because if we dont start winning a few we run the risk of getting a first overall pick and god forbid something good happens
predators,lxpj6hx,2024-11-17 23:34:34,I stopped watching and we immediately scored two goals. I’m leaving the game off the rest of the night.

predators,lxpk71m,2024-11-17 23:41:46,THIS IS WHAT I FUCKING EXPECTED ON JULY 1ST
predators,lxpki3r,2024-11-17 23:44:00,2 even strength goals in one game? Is that legal?
predators,lxpkk7e,2024-11-17 23:44:25,Kind of do feel bad it's lankinen the preds are lighting up right now. Preds need the dubs though.
predators,lxpnxg8,2024-11-18 00:10:11,I'm not mad about the call. I'm mad that I've seen the same thing waved off and we never get these calls in our favor.
predators,lxpqruy,2024-11-18 00:33:50,cut away before i could see bruno pick up our teeny tiny goalie 
predators,lxoth77,2024-11-17 20:46:16,9pm Sunday game… ugh

predators,lxpkudr,2024-11-17 23:46:32,That’s 3 goals scored while I was away washing dishes. Gonna leave the rest to soak until the 3rd period. I think I’m on to something here.
predators,lxpqlla,2024-11-18 00:32:21,Vancouver can go fuck themselves
predators,lxpr3wo,2024-11-18 00:36:42,THIS is the team I was expecting this year. Its comfortable. We are pushing but not constantly fighting to keep possession or constantly defending to keep pace with the opposing offense. What changed tonight?
predators,lxp3uij,2024-11-17 21:50:24,Quinn Hughes looks like he just found out his beloved pet died in every highlight clip.
predators,lxp7ro9,2024-11-17 22:15:32,F’n bs to sit Tommer when he’s played so well lately. And they should play Wilsby over Schenn.
predators,lxp8cm2,2024-11-17 22:19:19,L’Heureux!!!
predators,lxp8cui,2024-11-17 22:19:21,Let’s go!!! Huge moment for ZLH

predators,lxp8zl4,2024-11-17 22:23:31,ZLH is going to get a Gordie and he will fight Sherwood for it. That would be awesome.
predators,lxpa2h2,2024-11-17 22:30:38,Okay that couple is bad luck
predators,lxpajoa,2024-11-17 22:33:52,Did... did they just pass the puck to the front of their own wide open net?! Are they actively trying to lose now?
predators,lxpbs7e,2024-11-17 22:42:14,So uhhh are we gonna get to watch the game or no
predators,lxpcq55,2024-11-17 22:48:39,I think we should run a Tomasino Parssinen Stamkos line.  Drop McCarron out and move Sissons to the 4th line.  Have we tried March Novak Vang yet?  82 and 77 have really good chemistry together
predators,lxpibpt,2024-11-17 23:28:11,We actually scored on the power play??
predators,lxpibqi,2024-11-17 23:28:11,Thank fucking god someone besides our 4th line gets a goal
predators,lxpie8l,2024-11-17 23:28:42,That was a wicked wristah

predators,lxpit6b,2024-11-17 23:31:47,Hahaha that's what you get for hamming that high stick up Sherwood! (I still love and miss you though )
predators,lxpix53,2024-11-17 23:32:37,We took back a lead?!?!  What- what do I do now?  Is this when we do that cheering thing I’ve heard about?
predators,lxpk79p,2024-11-17 23:41:49,Yo new team who dis?

predators,lxpkhpp,2024-11-17 23:43:55,This doesn’t even look like the same team and I’m here for it.
predators,lxpkt5s,2024-11-17 23:46:17,Stammer 5 on 5 goal for the hatty and he’s officially back
predators,lxpl6aq,2024-11-17 23:48:52,Stamkos just passed Guy Lafleur and tied Mike Modano for 27th all time with 561 goals
predators,lxpqi5e,2024-11-18 00:31:32,Stamkos has no reason to be out there right now but do wish he could get his hatty.
predators,lxpqo08,2024-11-18 00:32:55,oh it feels good to win especially when i know people are gonna be even more pissed to lose to the preds atm 
predators,lxpqpuw,2024-11-18 00:33:21,Every win is massive moving forward.
predators,lxp0yyo,2024-11-17 21:32:38,Thank God Tommy Novak is back.

predators,lxpqm9u,2024-11-18 00:32:30,Tuning in late but I see that Stammer converted on the PP twice and that we scored some goals!

predators,lxp4map,2024-11-17 21:55:14,Am I crazy or is the Wilsby thing weird? Call him up warm him up for two of the games but not play him?
predators,lxp8ppu,2024-11-17 22:21:41,Only thing that would've been better is if this was a home game. He would've gotten so many more cheers.

predators,lxpkbu1,2024-11-17 23:42:43,Stamkos has been fuckin sharp shooting today. That first goal was a real veteran move and this one was classic stammer
predators,lxpke0d,2024-11-17 23:43:09,You can see the potential just gotta put it together consistently
predators,lxpkok1,2024-11-17 23:45:20,This is happiness. NHL is being put on notice it’s fucking Stammer time. Stanley Cup here we come!

(also can’t sleep after adrenaline from a game so adulting!)  Every time I check the score it goes up. Seemingly for us. I’ll continue to not watch because the only time I turned it on VAN scored. Back to your screens and I’ll keep doing my part.  Zlh! Stammer! The captain! Let’s go!

predators,lxpok0j,2024-11-18 00:15:13,I’m glad Stammer is scoring on the PP but it’s visibly noticeable that he needs a center. If it takes a 1st rounder so be it I guess. You can’t have him feeling it like he is tonight with no one to feed/support him. 
predators,lxpps5i,2024-11-18 00:25:25,Former Preds absolutely feast against us it's wild 
predators,lxppu3c,2024-11-18 00:25:51,Ngl i dont like our chances if they pull their goalie
predators,lxppxkk,2024-11-18 00:26:41,Please don't just roll over and stop playing... Do they even have a shot this period?
predators,lxpq1s6,2024-11-18 00:27:40,Holy fuck Sis you needed THAT
predators,lxpq2xu,2024-11-18 00:27:56,Schenn got around someone!
predators,lxpqeh9,2024-11-18 00:30:39,ONE shot for the whole 3rd period is not good

predators,lxp74di,2024-11-17 22:11:19,This game *just started*? Man I'm not tuning in for this mess someone post the highlights tomorrow
predators,lxp77b1,2024-11-17 22:11:50,I’m ready to be hurt! I don’t sleep normally so the late start isn’t gonna stop me from some Sunday pain
predators,lxpa8zl,2024-11-17 22:31:52,I think that went off McCarron's stick and into the goal
predators,lxpb7yr,2024-11-17 22:38:26,tomasino - novak - stamkosmarchessault - parssinen - evangelista maybe swap tomasino and evangelista but you get the point it’s not that fucking hard to come up with some line combos that actually make sense.
predators,lxpch2a,2024-11-17 22:46:55,I guess I could watch the enemy feed... Lol
predators,lxpcuiy,2024-11-17 22:49:29,lmao did you guys see Luke Schenn straight up stop defending and go for a change while the canucks were attacking
predators,lxpf70t,2024-11-17 23:05:50,Did you see the Pred walking out of the tunnel flipping somebody off lol?
predators,lxpfysr,2024-11-17 23:11:22,Who the hell is this team? Actually shooting?!?
predators,lxpg6bl,2024-11-17 23:12:54,Boys stop it with the need for fancy fucking plays and just shoot the damn puck.
predators,lxpg988,2024-11-17 23:13:28,Who's these guys & where'd they put the Preds?
predators,lxpgel7,2024-11-17 23:14:32,Feels like we’ve upped the physicality tonight at least which is good cause we got absolutely bullied by Vancouver in the playoffs last season
predators,lxpgkm7,2024-11-17 23:15:43,Paint job on Saros's helmet is fuckin sick
predators,lxpgswd,2024-11-17 23:17:21,Passing and zone entry's have been improving but they are still struggling with executing once they are set up in the zone. Lots of back and forth from the perimeter but nothing really looks all that dangerous.
predators,lxphaw1,2024-11-17 23:20:57,Damn it all!
predators,lxphcbe,2024-11-17 23:21:13,Ayyyeeeee we suck! Ayyyeeee we suck!

predators,lxpibkw,2024-11-17 23:28:09,I’ve been hopeful so far but fuck me.. we’re so goddamn slow and sloppy
predators,lxpj5x2,2024-11-17 23:34:27,What the fuck just happened!? We were down by 1 and I went to rinse a few dishes for like two minutes?? Did we score that fast back to back!?
predators,lxpjcyp,2024-11-17 23:35:54,I feel like we’re playing better overall but oof these failed zone exits are still hard to watch
predators,lxpjonw,2024-11-17 23:38:09,"Bruno and Trotz ""alright we don't want to win the presidents trophy because that shit is cursed so we're gonna be dog ass for the first quarter of the season then yall can play however you want"""
predators,lxpjti5,2024-11-17 23:39:03,Thank you Saros
predators,lxpju0s,2024-11-17 23:39:09,That was an absolutely insane cut that Hughes did there I can’t believe he held onto the puck

predators,lxpk8x5,2024-11-17 23:42:08,Lankys glove is getting exposed.
predators,lxpkwcv,2024-11-17 23:46:55,Trying to pinpoint what the difference in our game is tonight. Seems like we’re more physical and going to the net more is there anything else?
predators,lxpojqr,2024-11-18 00:15:10,What’s the difference? We look like a different team tonight. Is it the team we are playing? We look more complete. Things are clicking. Defense and offense are playing extremely well and are in sync with one another. How do we keep this pattern?
predators,lxpozym,2024-11-18 00:18:53,Damn. Fil clobbered him with that hit haha
predators,lxpps5n,2024-11-18 00:25:25,Playing not to lose is how you lose
predators,lxpptq4,2024-11-18 00:25:46,Well shit. Watch them go to and lose in overtime now
predators,lxpq0fr,2024-11-18 00:27:21,Team isn’t even trying to play offence just wants to play passive defence. Better not let them win this game like the playoffs finish the game in regulation we need the points!
predators,lxpq94c,2024-11-18 00:29:24,Not one shot this whole period that’s pathetic can’t play like that with a lead
predators,lxpqe32,2024-11-18 00:30:34,We got a SOG finally

predators,lxpm94v,2024-11-17 23:57:02,Do we get the preds or the perds in the 3rd?

predators,lxpp3ai,2024-11-18 00:19:38,Do we have a shot in this period?
predators,lxppphh,2024-11-18 00:24:47,Maybe they should try to play offense a little bit before they lose the game
predators,lxpppzx,2024-11-18 00:24:54,Ah there it is

predators,lxoyllx,2024-11-17 21:17:52,Play Wilsby over Schenn damn it.
predators,lxppr4y,2024-11-18 00:25:10,I’ll let that one slide because it’s Sherwood
predators,lxpbxj2,2024-11-17 22:43:13,So I guess we're not allowed to watch the game? It looks like the clock is still going when I google the score.
predators,lxph4wv,2024-11-17 23:19:45,Sissons back in the box
predators,lxphhy4,2024-11-17 23:22:18,Another failed clearance cost us a goal.

predators,lxpi9k6,2024-11-17 23:27:45,Sissons taking that penalty is a fucking joke. Perfectly encapsulates what he's provided to the team this year. More pim than points. One of the many reasons this team is a dumpster fire
predators,lxppqqj,2024-11-18 00:25:04,Dammit… had to be Sherwood…
predators,lxpb1i1,2024-11-17 22:37:12,Are you kidding me….these players either don’t care or are unfit to play
predators,lxpppw5,2024-11-18 00:24:52,I miss Sherwood a ton great player

predators,lxpn4gf,2024-11-18 00:03:46,Well that’s a pleasant surprise to wake up to. The fucking bus that left 2 mins early from my airport which caused me to take a $50 uber.

predators,lxpcn0n,2024-11-17 22:48:02,Pretty gud. I got some body washes and lotions from Bath and Body Works and a nice little Indian lady handed me a coupon for free shit in line. Then we went to Chuy's for dinner. Wbu?
predators,lxpi2kg,2024-11-17 23:26:22,Agreed. He has brought some punch to a line that was playing soft. He is also our only center who has been consistently getting around the crease causing havoc
predators,lxphy4h,2024-11-17 23:25:30,neither should tomasino.

predators,lxphyfj,2024-11-17 23:25:33,He’s been playing like a 4th liner this season. He’s been on the PK and has looked great there and has been forechecking well but is getting absolutely no offense
predators,lxpirwt,2024-11-17 23:31:32,Hey hey hey.
predators,lxpknb9,2024-11-17 23:45:04,Nah.  This is just to give us hope before making us sad next game.  But I really hope I’m wrong.
predators,lxpkra6,2024-11-17 23:45:54,Wait is that allowed?
predators,lxpozjx,2024-11-18 00:18:47,Once again I question why we don’t try him at C for even like one game. We clearly need another center and he has so much experience in that position. I assume it’s because he’s lost a step but ROR was a great center for us last season and he doesn’t really have the speed anymore either
predators,lxppwn3,2024-11-18 00:26:28,Tbf just about everyone has been feasting off of us this season.

predators,lxnha4n,2024-11-17 16:08:41,New to hockey.  Does Fabbro hitting the ice running? skating? with the CBJ lend any credence to the questions about coaching or poor management? Or is it just him doing better elsewhere?

predators,lxntbj5,2024-11-17 17:14:40,They have trust issues. 
predators,lxnmmc7,2024-11-17 16:37:50,The “issue” with Fabbro is that it seemed like management didn’t trust him enough to play consistently. He was healthy scratched often and therefore didn’t get enough playing time. So in games where he did play and didn’t perform incredibly management took it as validation. He’s talented a good stay at home defender but our management loves traffic cones on roombas instead so he’s out.
predators,lxnwljm,2024-11-17 17:32:51,This is common when players get traded. They hustle and put in extra effort because they have something to prove to their new team.There’s also something to be said for someone being new to the team and its system and therefore scouting reports by opposing teams may not include details on the recently traded player (likes to go glove side often cheats down low etc etc). Give Fabbro a few months and he will be disappointing CBJ fans too. He’s not a bad player. But he’s not an impact player or a grinder or a workhorse. Fabbro is what happens when you create a custom player in Chel and distribute all stats evenly.
predators,lxp2k43,2024-11-17 21:42:28,I want to tell you no but that would just be a lie.
predators,lxoxmuo,2024-11-17 21:11:56,Yes to all of that?Waiving him was an enormous mistake. Scratching him half the season was an enormous mistake. Trotz being the GM is an enormous mistake. Every single move he makes (except Nyquist) has bitten this team in the ass... and will continue to do so for 7 years.I know people like to cry about doomers and negativity but there is *literally* nothing about the Nashville Predators to be excited about right now and they show no signs of fixing it. Despite promises to bench players and start youth rebuild mode... Trotz has dropped 4 more games and changed nothing.To say this season is a disaster would undersell disasters.
predators,lxp21ug,2024-11-17 21:39:20,Ownership doesn't care. They never have and Haslam certainly won't now that he's the majority owner.Games are still selling out - or close to. The only gripe he'll have is that they're gonna miss that sweet sweet playoff money - but it's just one season. You're going to need 3-4 in a row before Haslam *really* starts to notice money missing.Haslam doesn't care about hockey at all - he doesn't even know hockey. Haslam cares about profits... and as a part-owner of a couple downtown bars he's making hand over fist owning this team.

predators,lxojyoa,2024-11-17 19:48:15,It’s weird because I guess you owe it to the new guys to figure this shit out (it’s embarrassing) but it’s not like they’re pulling their weight. i’d way rather suffer. even if they figure it out it’s just another first round exit.
predators,lxp8wc3,2024-11-17 22:22:55,Yeah that really is the best case finally getting it after spending 100 mill or whatever is pretty ridiculous but so be it. Really hope they don’t trade big assets for another Kyle Turris situation gotta learn from the past
predators,lxno0w3,2024-11-17 16:45:31,Fabbro either being on the first pairing or in the press box never made a bit of sense. Still don’t get it.
predators,lxnxsf5,2024-11-17 17:39:39,Maybe or maybe they thought he was simply a third pairing defenseman and you can pay less than $2.5 million for them. Note our current cap space is fake until the Johansson issue is resolved. If they rule for Ryan we would have had no cap space prior to putting Fabbro on waivers.

predators,lxtmmf1,2024-11-18 16:30:13,Maybe. He also seems to be the exact kind of player that compliments Werenski too. Werenski is a very mobile all over the ice offensive defenseman. Fabbro being kind of quiet and playing in his shadow seems to mesh. He doesn’t really need to be a super high impact player he needs to be a second fiddle. Guess we will see what happens.

predators,lxrf3rq,2024-11-18 09:40:41,The Kyle Turris trade was a good trade at the time and for about 6 months. There is no way anyone can predict when a player will decline but every player eventually declines.

Preds legit have to be the only franchise in all of pro sports to go this long without a top draft pick and with no results either. It’s insane

predators,lxlaqtq,2024-11-17 08:45:23,I know people are already impatient with Trotz but is more so put some blame on Bruno. He seems like a good coach but I think he performed much better with his interim stint in Florida because of the speed and talent that he had. I think we obv have talent. Forsberg and Josi are staples and Stammer March and some other vets are no slouches either. But we’re just- slow. And that’s killing us. Teams are getting younger and faster and you’re not gonna get a Celebrini Bedard or McDavid unless you’re truly garbage. Sorry to say that’s what we need. What I do admire with Trotz is he started with veteran presence again. But seeing as how it’s resulting in slow starts and possible chemistry issues he already admitted that he’s not afraid to backtrack and begin ripping it down to nuts and bolts. I think we do need a real reset. We’ve been competitive for so long and come up just short during success. It’s time to start a new chapter of young guys. Give them time to play let the vets help them. Suck for a bit build back up. At this point there’s just no other path.
predators,lxm8blg,2024-11-17 12:07:37,Y’all I’m a habs and Preds fan. This season is depressing
predators,lxllgmi,2024-11-17 09:57:41,The problem is the slow players are tied up in big contracts and Bruno’s system relies on speed. A good coach needs to adjust their system to match the talent otherwise you’ll keep trying to fit a round peg in a square hole.
predators,lxmxzq8,2024-11-17 14:25:18,I'd rather not.  We have some good pieces.  Lets get some chemistry throughout the year tank get a good draft pick then dominate next year
predators,lxlnbx6,2024-11-17 10:09:00,As of this moment the team just needs to go all in for the 1st overall pick. Get that center we’ve always needed in James Hagens or Porter Martone. For our VGK pick we acquired from SJS maybe Cameron Reid for future PP defensemen or if we’re lucky Justin Carbonneau for a top 6 RW. I think this would be the smartest strategy instead of Trotz burning it all to the ground in trades.EDIT: Martone is a RW
predators,lxmxhqx,2024-11-17 14:22:38,There are no stand-outs in this year’s draft like Bedard or Celebrini in the last couple years.

predators,lxlqt33,2024-11-17 10:29:40,Everyone is clinging to the rebuild statement he made but isn’t listening to the clarifying comments. He won’t rip it down to the studs and rebuild. He said Saros Josi Fil Stamkos and Marchessault aren’t going anywhere if he makes changes. This team isn’t going to intentionally suck they just unintentionally suck.
predators,lxn6mfr,2024-11-17 15:12:20,"I would agree with this had all the vets been here before the coach. However Trotz hired Brunette first. ROR Nyquist Schenn Stamkos Marchessault Skjei all came second. So if there is an issue of Bruno's system not fitting the players we have that's fine. But how you can also admire Trotz for doing things in that order doesn't really make sense to me. Trotz himself even said the goal was to get younger and faster. Trotz April 19th 2023. End of year press conference before Bruno and signing ROR. >**""I'm looking to get faster""** Trotz said. ... ""If you get too old of a team I think you lose some of that enthusiasm and some of that fire that you need for an 82-game schedule. If you get too young [of a team] you can get overwhelmed and not have the guidance that you need to have success in this league… I think we're going to have a blend and I think that's the most dangerous when you have that blend.""Trotz May 31st 2023. Immediately after hiring Brunette: >**“I want our team to play faster**; I want our team to play with more skill” Trotz said. “I want those pillars of Predator relentless and determination to the core values of this organization. **This group won’t be lazy. It will be relentless hopefully and it will determined. That’s what we’re trying to create through this whole organization.**”Trotz on May 7th 2024: End of year press conference before free agency: >**""We are going to get a little younger**"" Trotz indicated. ""That's the way of the future."">**""I want to be a little bit faster""** Trotz said. ""I want to build out the top nine (forwards).""---This is all Trotz. He's said for years that his desire is to get younger and faster. He hired Brunette BECAUSE he coaches a fast relentless style who has excelled at building up younger players. So Trotz spends an entire year building up Brunette's system only to completely undo it with one free agent class because he stopped focusing on the long term goal of transitioning this team into a younger faster team. Now we've got to either unwind the free agency or unwind the past 2 years of growth this team has been doing. To me it just seems so dumb to turn it all back. We need to bring up the kids and push guys like Stamkos Marchessault and Skjei all the way back in the lineup until they get up to speed. It's time for the youth movement that Poile and Trotz have been promising for the past 4 years."

predators,lxltx53,2024-11-17 10:47:39,Nuts and Bolts is exactly that. The key pieces that keep things going together. Obviously everyone you stated fits that bill. Of course they aren’t gonna drop those players that’s the reason I called them out initially in my comment. Having every single person outside of your major 6-7 people be on the board for possible trade/removal/cutting may as well be shooting for a true rebuild.
predators,lxnhgm9,2024-11-17 16:09:39,I suppose that’s fair. I’m not a crystal ball reading nhl analyst like some of you guys are. I don’t have the time to invest this much thought into the team so I just stated what I thought. I’ll admit I didn’t know Bruno was brought in by Trotz I assumed that was still a Poile thing. But yes I get where you’re coming from
predators,lxr2clz,2024-11-18 08:18:50,This is actually really interesting to see in aggregate because every time Trotz says “younger & faster” he does “older & slower”

predators,lxndaq0,2024-11-17 15:48:05,I’m using Sportnet.ca to keep up to date on rankings they have Martone labeled as a center (blame Sam Cosentino). But we really need Hagens on this team
predators,lxmdltb,2024-11-17 12:37:02,"Hagens and Martone are the top two it seems. Hagens being 5'11"" as a center might make teams hesitant and i could see him going second because of it but both are centers and there are 7 centers in the top 10 this year. Idk if they would be nhl ready right out of the draft though. We'll seeEdit: seems like Martone is a RW not a C so its Hagens or bust if we want that nearly guaranteed potential franchise guy at C it seems"
predators,lxmg4xf,2024-11-17 12:51:04,As far as draft years goes this years kinda is soft. If we pick first we are sure to get a good player. But hardly as good as the last two years have been. The first overall this year may have gone like 4th-6th the past two years from what I’ve seen. And that is if we even get the 1st overall.
predators,lxltdos,2024-11-17 10:44:31,They couldn’t get anything for Tolvanen or Fabbro. Teams aren’t lining up with draft capital or prospects for McCarron Smith Jankowski and the like down there. This whole dream of a rebuild doesn’t exist. As long as Saros is around the Preds are in purgatory.
predators,lxlwwss,2024-11-17 11:04:44,Your plan is the same plan as Poile and Trotz a “competitive rebuild” as they put it. That doesn’t exist. You can’t say these guys are slouches and then say we’re slow we’re slow because they signed these old guys to long term contracts and are keeping the Preds in purgatory. Keeping Josi made sense no issue there. If this team wanted to be good Fil and Saros needed to be traded. Teams can’t rebuild by trading away replacement level players. They have to have a team of replacement level players and trade away players of value.
predators,lxpgmbs,2024-11-17 23:16:03,For sure. Hope my tone wasn't too aggressive.

predators,lxpz2vs,2024-11-18 01:51:10,I need 2 good tickets for Saturday.I clicked the link for last ticket marketplaces and it didn’t work…
predators,lxjmck5,2024-11-16 23:12:43,You are spot on. Trotz absolutely has to find a center to either play 1C and RoR move down or a 2C. Stamkos and JM have no one capable of making plays to get them the puck to utilize their skillset. If Novak had been given more than like 15 minutes of TOI with Stamkos they might have turned that into something. The return for trading Askarov was a huge blow since it locked him into this roster essentially and he got nothing to help the current roster now or in 2 years. This IMO is where Trotz really fucked up. Something should have been done to get an impact center. And I like Skjei but we didn't need another left handed D. To me he's the one signing we didn't need. IF Bruno is a good coach he would make some sort of adjustments to salvage this. I absolutely don't want him fired but if he is here next year Trotz has to add another center to this roster who can really play. He just bought a lot of pretty pieces that don't fit together.
predators,lxjnwry,2024-11-16 23:24:24,"I think everyone is missing the forest through the trees here when we talk about a system change. What Trotz wants to do is establish the **Predators Way**. He said so himself a ton of times when he took over. The Predators way is not just a marketing term (probably...who fucking knows with Trotz).  Think of a team like Vegas Florida or Dallas. They've had multiple coaches over the past few years but every time the new coach can pick up where the other team left off without having to go through a stylistic change or roster turnover. Now think of how Nashville has transitioned. Lavi to Hynes to Bruno. Hynes emphasized a slower organized defense forward scheme. Bruno emphasizes a free flowing heavy hitting gegenpressen style of play. So a player that is going to excel under Hynes may not necessarily thrive under Bruno. Long term the problem we're facing is about draft strategy. Ideally you want to draft a certain type of player to fit a certain type of system: they play the **Predator's Way**. And the bigger problem is that if you change course 2.5 years into a draft strategy you wipe the effectiveness of the draft years you already had. So now instead of a system that emphasizes speed and forechecking we're moving into a system that emphasizes skill and isn't concerned by a guy being a heavy skater. Obviously the kids are adaptable and skill is skill. But you have a lot easier chance of finding a diamond in the rough if you know where to look. Trotz is thinking about this team as two separate groups two separate windows. You have Josi's window which maybe is 3-4 more years. Then you have the next kid's window. Trotz projects his next ""core"" to start emerging in 2-3 more years as guys like Wood and Molendyk take the torch from Josi and O'Reilly. He thinks he's going to be competitive now. But it's really just a bridge to get us to the next group in like 2027. THIS is the very hard place the Preds have put themselves in. This team needs to be establishing a system. We need to be the type of team that can go from Quinnville to Brunette to Maurice and continue to be trophy winners. But we can't. Because the players Trotz signed don't want to play in the system Trotz signed off on. The THAT is the rock and the hard place. We could once again sell out with a new coach who caters to the guys we have but potentially harms the long term rebuild. Or we keep Bruno (or a similar coach) and continue to rebuild on the trajectory we're on even if it means short term pain."
predators,lxmqry1,2024-11-17 13:47:38,Our goaltending and our PK have continued to give us opportunities to win but our offense has just sucked. I think there was an over reliance on an assumption that our 5v5 was going to continue being at-least average. Too much passing too many neutral zone turnovers not enough gritty/ugly goals at the net. As u/gmbarrytrotz pointed out this is a stopgap while we run the contracts of guys like Josi. We had money to spend we spent it. We have not sold our future on a his team iteration. What we are not doing is giving the young guys the time to play though and we need to commit to that the minute the playoffs are too far out of reach.
predators,lxjj6zg,2024-11-16 22:49:59,What good is a system that is so different from what most guys even future hall of famers struggle so mightily to adapt. What good is it if we spend the first half of every season with the additions figuring it out? How the heck are they supposed to integrate trade deadline acquisitions (assuming they're even in a position to be buyers). Has Taylor changed the system in Milwaukee or will the youngsters also need weeks or months to figure it out when they come up? I think the streak last season proved the system ca work but is the cost too high for it to be a long term solution?
predators,lxk0w4m,2024-11-17 01:09:38,Preds up & got some big guys who do not even remotely fit the system & it shows.They were hoping pure skill wins but it seems obvious this isn't working out. Now they're kind of stuck with it. One only hopes they gel enough in the first 1/2 to become good in the second. 
predators,lxl4egz,2024-11-17 07:57:24,The Preds were something like the fifth oldest roster last season. Being old and slow isn't a new thing and this is what Trotz gave Brunette since he's been the coach.

predators,lxjmqh8,2024-11-16 23:15:34,I think Novak lacks the mental fortitude to handle any pressure. I think that when the pressure is off he is an above average player. But when the pressure is on he wilts. This is why you sometimes think he is legit and then he disappears. I don't understand why but I think that is his deal.
predators,lxlyupq,2024-11-17 11:15:29,At this rate we will get a #1C in the draft as we will be picking in the Top 3.
predators,lxn8ezl,2024-11-17 15:21:59,"I think the adjustments have been coming. It started with simplifying the D zone and defending the rush against. And our defense has gotten a LOT better. The next step is going to be figuring out how to improve the offense in a way that works with our team. The problem is that our system is free flowing and relies on a relentless forecheck physicality and tons of speed. You can't so easily just ""adjust"" it. It would be like expecting the Titans with Henry to just ""adjust"" into a pass first team. It can probably be done but it'll take forever and you don't really have the personnel for it. None of this is really recognizing the fact that there's not a NHL system that emphasizes slow old lazy players. Outside of the power play which we seem to be excelling at."
predators,lxsfsj1,2024-11-18 12:54:27,Trotz is impatient and has changed his mind so many times we have no direction. I agree. He went from adding a few cup winners and pairing them with our kids to just signing old guys to 8 year deals. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense after the buyouts
predators,lxk4ll3,2024-11-17 01:42:49,Personally I'm in the:1. keep brunette camp2. Try like hell to undo some of the free agency before the TDL. Move Skjei has to be a priority at this point even tho it'll be next to impossible3. Let this season sink into last place for better draft capital.4. Re-evaluate our talent development system. We've fumbled so many talents that I've started seriously doubting that it's the talent.I get where we are headed but it feels like we won't get there unless we get a good enough draft pick that doesn't need 4-5 years before seeing Bridgestone ice.I've made peace with Josi never getting a cup but I don't think I can with Fil and juiceI hate saying this out loud but I'd give anything for the dallas talent system to move here.
predators,lxjn2k6,2024-11-16 23:18:02,I've seen him in some games get roughed up and come back to score a goal or make a sweet assist but he's made out of cookie dough. Dude has to get a get stronger. Playoffs are more physical and that's why he wasn't a factor at all I think.
predators,lxsg1dp,2024-11-18 12:55:40,This is the problem with our forward development. If we draft someone in a high round they aren’t almost guaranteed to never get a chance up here and if they do it’s grinder minutes so they fail. I would almost want to refuse to play here.
predators,lxjm1pe,2024-11-16 23:10:28,That's the Tennessee sports way. Titans. Vols. Vandy. Preds. Destined to suck
predators,lxjk37k,2024-11-16 22:56:16,Wedgewood posted a .912 and only gave up 3 against Edmonton which is damn good for a guy who won't see 20 starts this season in front of a defense that for years had hung their goalie out to dry. We've seriously been spoiled with starting goalies and forgot how to play defense. As for the other 3 Brunette's system is meant to push the tempo we were already slow and adding very skilled but aging players who weren't known for speed at their peak certainly didn't help. I don't know if the system needs to change or the roster does but something has to give. If you look at the product on the ice it's not fun to watch. You don't see improvements from them there's no goals there's no big hits the power play is a snore at best we get some highlight reel saves.Asking the fans to be patient last year was understandable. New coach new GM new system ok we'll see how it goes. You go all out in free agency and hype this team 3 new skaters but the rest of the team the coaching staff the system all the same patience goes out the window. I could give room if we were losing from some bad puck but we're playing bad hockey. I have no faith they can hold a lead and I dread overtime. I heard give them 15 games they've played 18 and are dead last. I heard they need a road trip they're on one and they went from Skjei losing his edge costing us the OT against Colorado to Edmonton to just a snore against Calgary. They've gotten worse every game of the trip.

predators,lxla1x5,2024-11-17 08:40:19,I said in a comment on another post recently that if this continues on this path that Trotz might’ve set the franchise back 10 years. I got some pushback and that made me think but the more I thought about it the more I could see it. Say Trotz gets 3 more years while they flirt with 8th seeds. Ultimately gets replaced now the new gm has to work with these bloated finishes to the remaining terms on these new deals now the new GM would need 3-4 years to orchestrate a rebuild in that person’s image/vision. I haven’t given up yet but it’s totally possible that Trotz royally fucked this up. Trading Askarov is going to look like an all time blunder.

predators,lxjpee3,2024-11-16 23:35:57,Most of these games the Preds are losing they are winning the expected goal stat. Based on that they should have beaten CAL and EDM too I think. Can't score 5v5 for some reason. I think they are a really good center away from clicking. Wedgewood just looks so stiff out there. No qualms about him being the backup for 17ish games. Maybe he'll get more if/when as this season painfully drags on.
predators,lxjm1n1,2024-11-16 23:10:28,I tend to get an Imperial mentality when faced with failure or incompetence. We should be glad for the players’ sake that I am not their coach even if I were somehow a super talented coach. I simply do not look kindly on failure.

predators,lxm8koy,2024-11-17 12:09:02,Look at Kucherov's career history though. Drafted after one year in the Q D1 was in the Q D2 was a half season in the AHL and then was immediately getting 13 minutes a night in Tampa at 20 years old. Does this organizational philosophy even allow for 20 year olds to get that much ice time? Or does it emphasize letting them marinate in the AHL? Trotz says his plan so far is to give every kid 2-3 years in the minors before bringing them into the show.

predators,lxp6ima,2024-11-17 22:07:27,I think they’re just afraid to let the kids make mistakes because young players tend to do that a lot.

predators,lxjdugb,2024-11-16 22:13:50,I’ve watched the last five games. They are playing better than the Preds that began the season that I would have describe as “hapless”. The last two games went to OT and were only lost because someone with the puck lost an edge and lost the puck leading to a breakaway. So they are improving even though the record doesn’t show. How they break through and figure out a way to win these games is the next step.
predators,lxiz2oa,2024-11-16 20:36:51,Mark Jankowski and Luke Schenn. Why do they ever get ice time?

The rest of the guys aren't that valuable. This is the worst part about Trotz' moves. You can't get out of them. They're LONG term deals with no move clauses. We're in it. 3 more years left. For deadline moves you've got:  This year: Nyquist Sissons.  Next year: O'Reilly Novak Schenn Lauzon.  3rd year: Carrier? Buckle in guys. It's a long unwinding.
predators,lxj109u,2024-11-16 20:49:00,At this point it might need to be Brunette that gets let go. Not sure who you replace him with though if you do.
predators,lxj0mit,2024-11-16 20:46:34,Schenn McCarron Smith Wedgewood NyquistJankowski to name a few. Honestly I think it might have to be a coaching issue at this point cause Bruno keeps switching the lines up every game and there not a shred of fucking chemistry between lines at all because no one is one a line long enough to generate chemistry with their line mates they just have one shit game and it’s another line for you! Can’t win games if you keep switching up lines and not letting your guys develop chemistry together.
predators,lxjp36t,2024-11-16 23:33:30,Realistically I see Scissons Schenn and Jankowski being on the trade block. Personally I’d rather see them get scratched for a mental reset and let Svechkov Kemell and Ufko get called up for NHL ice time.
predators,lxk2giv,2024-11-17 01:23:53,wut. Doomer mode ON!These guys got locked in for good. There is no dumping them... other clubs would receive picks from Preds in return & Preds would still be picking up 1/2 the owed tender to get them shipped out plus the NMC would stop the Preds from sending them to clubs not Cup-bound.Better off just sucking with them @ this point to get picks.It's like the Preds went full-on Turris times three.

predators,lxo2yjs,2024-11-17 18:09:20,I think there are a couple things to consider. First the whole RyJo situation less for the cap space and more for the retention spot. The second is that it's a bit of a hard question because we don't have a bunch of players on expiring contracts as players on expiring contracts are easier to move.Regardless I think both Novak and Nyquist are on the block as it pertains to forwards. Novak is likely harder to move but it is possible if teams are looking for that middle 6 center. Nyquist is a solid addition to any contender looking for a winger to add some depth scoring. I know some people are likely to think Tomasino but I think he has been shopped too much that people won't bite on him.In terms of defense I think Lauzon is the most likely. With Fabbro gone we have no d-man on expiring contracts so all of them come with that off-season+1 more year. Of those available it is Schenn Lauzon and Stastney. With how attractive Zadorov was last year I feel like Lauzon will attract similar amounts of attention.None of these are high-end sales but at the deadline and with possibly 2 retentions spots with plenty of cap space we can charge a lot of cap strapped teams to retain salary

predators,lxj683b,2024-11-16 21:23:00,Dump everyone we can over age 26. Make room for the guys in Milwaukee.RoR Novak Nyquist Sissons Smith McCarron Lauzon Schenn Carrier and Jankowski would all go in this scenario. If we really think we can win with this group then I don't want to lose these guys but the team is showing that they cannot win as currently constructed.Skjei Josi Forsberg Stamkos and Madchessault all have NTC or NMCs so they cannot be moved. That is enough veteran leadership to hopefully help out the new guys. Everyone else is under 26.If you want to keep ROR just because our other Centers being developed are not ready yet I won't complain.Trade for prospects or NHL players instead of picks because picks won't get to the NHL for approx 4 years. David Jiricek (CBJ) is an example of a player I would target. He was the 6th overall pick a few years ago. He didn't play a lot in his draft year or he would have been picked higher. You could argue that he hasn't done much in Columbus and that is very true. But we are good at developing defensemen and I would take our chances at developing a defenseman over a forward. I know people are going to point to Fabbro as a failure but Fabbro was forced into the lineup because we traded Subban. Defensemen who play in Milwaukee are genrally better than their draft position.  Carrier and Del Gaizo are just the recent examples.

predators,lxj3iib,2024-11-16 21:05:10,Karl Taylor is the obvious answer
predators,lxl1erb,2024-11-17 07:31:48,The team was just purchased by Bill Haslam (in part it's a complicated purchase structure). I assure you he has no plans to sell the team ***AND*** he doesn't care about winning.Haslam cares that the team makes the most money possible - and in the NHL that's going to mean that they sell tickets and make the playoffs more than they don't. Even if the Preds miss the playoffs this year it's not likely this roster continues to do so. Haslam is most likely entirely satisfied with his purchase and will see no reason to make any changes.As long as the Predators are more of a Broadway attraction and honky tonk waiting room those tickets will sell. 2017 taught owners that if you can create enough buzz then tourists and drunks will buy tickets with zero care for the on-ice product.Welcome to the New Predators - same as New Nashville. Same name same look entirely devoid of soul or originality.
predators,lxkbwt4,2024-11-17 02:57:52,We haven’t developed a top pair defenseman in 10 years though. Although I do really like Jiricek it would likely take a significant asset for that to happen.
predators,lxj8lzg,2024-11-16 21:38:52,Yeah there’s no way they trade half of the NHL roster. Also CBJ is rebuilding so why would they get rid of their top D prospect and what could the Preds even offer them that’d fit their timeline?

predators,lxizg3g,2024-11-16 20:39:11,I am 100% in on a rebuild. I was very much trade Forsberg and Saros before new contracts but that didn’t happen. So now they’re stuck. The whole Trotz rebuild sound bite was great until he clarified what he meant. This is all on him now so we’ll see how it turns around but this team needed a full on rebuild since they got beat first round of the playoffs after winning the President’s Trophy.
predators,lxjaur5,2024-11-16 21:53:47,Trotz just signed 3 of them he will give them at least another 12 months to get their act together. The trouble is the core of the team is old and getting older. Any success is really all on Saros. If he can get hot steal some games and give the team swagger/confidence again they can reach their ceiling. Imo their ceiling is a 7-8 seed in the west with 90% chance they go out in first round.
predators,lxj7ree,2024-11-16 21:33:13,A lot of these guys have no movement or no trade clauses. Also some of these contracts like Stamkos are genuinely abysmal so they’re not getting anything out of them in a trade and besides real contending teams don’t have the cap space to take on these massive contracts.

predators,lxjhglg,2024-11-16 22:38:20,">Saros before new contracts but that didn’t happen.And thats what put us in a spot where a rebuild isn't possible. It is but it would start with no end of it in sight. Starting from basically the same position as expansion even. Which was a nearly 10 year struggle. Signing Saros and shipping out Askarov meant having to get guys right away who can score and realize the cup window is now until mayyybe 4 years from now. I wanted to hang with Askarov and fully blow it up and build the team from the net outward. But now that this path has been chosen it would be foolish for Trotz to give up just 2 months in. The team's compete level is shit the weak lower parts of our roster are bringing down the top parts of our roster. Its all a mess. But this was the direction they went so like you said we'll see how it turns around. BIG TIME agree with you that this team needed a full on rebuild since the Prez trophy. When they fired Lavy I seriously thought ""nice here comes the rebuild"". But nah."

The local fans aren't going to pay these prices for this product but tourists will.Nashville being a destination city also hurts. Visiting fans will just come make a weekend of it. We're a place that people want to be hence why 30-50% of the arena is visitors now.

predators,lxk4gow,2024-11-17 01:41:35,I knew it would rub some wrong but this is more indictment of the front office not Sissons. Snossis is good on 3rd or 4th line center. Preds legend from the cup run. But using him to try to get 2nd line scoring in 2024 is screwing over everyone. 
predators,lxjum2v,2024-11-17 00:17:04,The way I jumped and screamed when it happened only to be confused by the announcers not properly recognizing itWhat a legendary run that year. Sissons is a hero forever for that shit alone
predators,lxjikj9,2024-11-16 22:45:47,Let's be honest with ourselves.... Novak isn't a 2C either.Novak is a solid 2 way center that would play best at 3C.

canes,lxu9luk,2024-11-18 18:34:19,Happy to take delivery in 122 row S at an upcoming game...
canes,lxtf3bh,2024-11-18 15:52:24,To hit anyone without a puck is a penalty - interference. A deliberate pick is the same penalty.On the PP: If you pass around the perimeter the idea is to lure the defense out of position or work them into exhaustion to open them up for seam passes to open shooters.Very rarely do you want to shoot on a rush. Minimalize your movement and increase the defense's.On the PK: you want to keep a diamond shape rotating the sides to the top occasionally to minimize the offensive way you can pick on a single player. You also want to create odd man sections of the ice to win board battles. The diamond shape minimizes straight on shots and seam passes and promotes point and odd angle shooting. It is adaptable and the Canes prefer aggressive PK to keep the other team passing/moving (wear and tear)Hope this helps!
canes,lxu40pk,2024-11-18 18:02:04,Think of hockey like basketball. Once people make the connection that the sports and strategies are pretty similar understanding the game opens up. In basketball you don’t want a guy driving the lane and forcing up a shot surrounded by defenders. Or pulling up for a 3 with a hand in your face. Same concept for hockey. Work the puck/ball around to get the best shot possible.
canes,lxu37zt,2024-11-18 17:57:35,I do think they should have some kind of internal timer or pass count where if lanes just aren't opening up that a play is enacted 50 seconds with nothing? Annexation of Puerto Rico time
canes,lxtgjbf,2024-11-18 15:59:37,Cheers bud I kinda figured it'd be easier to take a penalty with a full on rush so that makes sense.Regarding passing around the perimeter if the other team doesn't come out of position or at least holds tighter than you want them to how do you play around that?
canes,lxtiq13,2024-11-18 16:10:39,If they keep tight that means you also can get closer. They don't want to be tired so someone will bite.If they are THAT disciplined you have to keep moving (you or the puck). Take shots. Make them pay for blocking. Sustained pressure of even 45sis exhausting. More than that you're gonna loosen them up and not even be half as tired.Keep a man in the front for clean up and to cause some chaos. They will want to clear that guy out but it is VERY tiring to do so.When I'm on the PK I'm usually the one clearing the crease (this is how I know) and have been known to put that offensive player into a shot from the point.
canes,lxtjnk5,2024-11-18 16:15:17,That makes a ton of sense there's a few local teams that I want to get some lessons and eventually play with just trying to up my overall knowledge a bit more.   Tons of help dude I appreciate it a bunch!
canes,lxtm50l,2024-11-18 16:27:48,No problem!If learning play the wings first so you can observe more. Then try defense. If you got the lungs and legs try center.

canes,lxsgij3,2024-11-18 12:58:01,We are the second best team in the league today primarily because we essentially have no weak links at the moment. Everyone's doing their job as well as one could expect
canes,lxsiklk,2024-11-18 13:08:26,Our real weakness right now isn’t players it’s injuries.If I were to highlight a particular player it would likely be Burns. He’s not playing bad by any means—I’d say he’s actually stepped up a bit since last year—it’s just that everyone else is playing *so well.*
canes,lxsjkxw,2024-11-18 13:13:33,Freddie's body. Can't stay healthy. Nothing against him he's been great when he has played.
canes,lxshuy9,2024-11-18 13:04:49,to be perfectly honest... we dont really have one?like I guess Aho is in a bit of a goal scoring slump... but he's also got 15 points in 17 and has stepped up massively on defense? and we havent really NEEDED more points for most of our games.actually wait I do have one thing: the health and durability of our players particularly goalies.
canes,lxsgpml,2024-11-18 12:58:59,Aho and Svech need to step up.  They both have another gear to their game that just isn’t there right now.Walker needs to get his offense going.  He’s been really good at being the defensive defenseman in his pairing but he has a penchant for offense that hasn’t been there yet this year.But I think the real answer is Burns.  I feel like I almost don’t notice him most games.
canes,lxskouy,2024-11-18 13:19:09,Gotta be the goaltending for me again. Can’t rely on Freddie at all at this point and wouldn’t be comfortable going into the postseason with Martin as the #2. Feel like we have to make an upgrade there but there’s not currently a need to rush
canes,lxsgneb,2024-11-18 12:58:41,Everything is slotting together so nicely this year… if i had to nitpick i personally feel Staal’s already-slow and now declining speed will become an issue against some of the faster teams out West. Carrier could be a consistency issue if he gets too banged up in the next month or two. if we don’t acquire another goalie Martin will need to increase his poise under pressure and glovework. other than that maybe hope Blake doesn’t cool off and Gost reads passes from the bumpers a little better on the power play.
canes,lxsq4ml,2024-11-18 13:46:25,According to the guys behind me at the game last night it’s Aho 
canes,lxsj8s0,2024-11-18 13:11:51,we currently don't have any under performers or weak links.  but I am concerned with Anderson's re-occurring challenges to stay healthy after we bet the farm last year he ended up being a weak link.
canes,lxshc2i,2024-11-18 13:02:09,I don’t know who I’d pin that on at this point. There’s a time I would have easily said KK but not so much right now. It’s a good question because everyone is contributing right now.
canes,lxsssr4,2024-11-18 13:59:37,goalies. we are still patching it together and hoping for the best.
canes,lxskjg3,2024-11-18 13:18:23,Freddie Andersen followed closely by Aho/Scech and Burns. Aho/Svech should be stepping it up and scoring a lot more like Necas has but both of them are kinda just coasting along a performance plateau which is quite frustrating. Svech SHOULD be a 40 goal scorer. Aho SHOULD be putting up 90+points. But until it actually happens they are both underperforming big time. Also Burns is a liability often and his slapshot from the point is about as useless as a left handed spoon. Honestly excited for him to move on and hand the keys over to Nikishin next year 
canes,lxsqr98,2024-11-18 13:49:33,I’d say burns. His age is catching up to him now he just looks a step behind. Although that’s being nit picky as we really aren’t lacking anything right now besides health.
canes,lxt4t2w,2024-11-18 15:00:02,"Outside of injuries  Walker. People saying burns because he's not needed as much  and definitely not as an ""offensive"" defensemen compared to years past. He's got the most ice time avg. per game defensively.He's doing fine. Arguably less turnover at the blue line for him this year. Also less blocked shots on him from the blue line which led to plenty of odd man rushes for the other team where he couldn't match the speed."
canes,lxt5g16,2024-11-18 15:03:18,This team is good.  There’s some tests coming up in NJ DAL NY and FLA.  I think seeing how they do in those matchups will determine where the weak points are.Getting Jarvy back and getting Aho going is critical.  Necas is basically carrying the offense.
canes,lxsgp6h,2024-11-18 12:58:56,Burns and Chatfield are the only 2 on the team that still don't have a goal yet.  Not saying they are the weakest links at all but would be nice to see them find the back of the net soon especially Burns.
canes,lxtz95u,2024-11-18 17:35:59,Tony’s in Russia now we ain’t got weak links no more
canes,lxt6tpz,2024-11-18 15:10:24,The goalie position in general not even close. We are one injury to PK away from a Martin/Perets lineup and PK plays a game that is conducive to injury. If he can settle into the mindset a starter needs to have it would be a huge relief. But we still need to do something to improve the depth in that position optimally before the need arises. Agree to a point about what has been said about Aho and Svech but they are nowhere near weakest link category especially considering how well Roslovic has been doing (though he’s gone cold here lately too).
canes,lxswhk8,2024-11-18 14:18:08,Aho needs to shoot the damn puck
canes,lxt5tiy,2024-11-18 15:05:14,That begs the question what is Aho's job? He's created opportunities for Rosey to contribute and feel like a stud AND teams still need to respect him for what he is capable of. If he was cold and not opening up those other chances then I'd be worried but I think he really starts doing some damage if teams start sleeping on him.
canes,lxskkkm,2024-11-18 13:18:32,This is the only correct answer. A great goalie is only great if they are able to stay healthy.
canes,lxsjocp,2024-11-18 13:14:02,Burns is definitely at the point where age is catching up to him quickly. He’s still an above average player but nowhere near as dynamic as he was the last 2 seasons.
canes,lxskdml,2024-11-18 13:17:34,At this point in his career not noticing Burns is probably a good thing. I too had been expecting more from Walker but it’s still early yet. Looking forward to hopefully swing his production rise as he settles in more.
canes,lxsnj22,2024-11-18 13:33:19,To be fair svech has 16 points in 17 games but Aho needs to get out of whatever slump he is in.
canes,lxspu3g,2024-11-18 13:44:57,Burns has been absolutely fantastic defensively. Every game he's breaking up passes and disrupting the opponent's cycle. His offense hasn't been great but he's far from a liability out there and way better than he was at the end of last season.
canes,lxso09u,2024-11-18 13:35:43,I cannot wait for Nikishin to take Burns’ roster spot
canes,lxstj4b,2024-11-18 14:03:20,I think the approach with Burns on the ice now is not to feed him 20 blue line shots a game. His shooting and speed definitely declined last year so I think he's transitioing to be more of a defensive defenseman so he can stay in the league a few more years. He's on PK1 and is only getting PP2 minutes because of injury (he's playing as a forward on it). If we grade Burns by what he was two years ago yeah hes underperforming but based on what he is now I think he's playing as a fantastic defensive D who takes a lot of the top matchups in his ice time. I would not be surprised if he takes low cap 1 year deals the rest of his career to cup chase and that could be in Carolina
canes,lxszxbj,2024-11-18 14:35:24,You must have sat next to me I heard the same thing lol
canes,lxt4ekt,2024-11-18 14:58:04,Yes is I am forced with a gun to my head this is who i say first without hesitation. The small mistakes leading to the opponent having a man advantage the lackadaisical effort at times or just the inability to put shots on goal
canes,lxt6kd3,2024-11-18 15:09:05,The question of whether Necas was carrying was actually the catalyst to our conversation about weak links. Carrying to me implies that others aren't holding up their share. This isn't the case of a superstar player dragging scrubs along. He's not carrying we've just got a solid group of skaters right now.
canes,lxsmjn9,2024-11-18 13:28:23,Silly take to me. Blue line has like 9 goals out of our 60 so far for the season. It’s pretty clear we aren’t the same slap ‘em from the blue line team we were 2-3 years ago.
canes,lxsqber,2024-11-18 13:47:22,Burns has to have like 8000 attempted shots this year already Lol he will get one in the net eventually.
canes,lxsjz7s,2024-11-18 13:15:33,My answer to the question is Chatfield. Burns looks like he has been putting in a lot more effort this season and I'd love for him to score a goal soon. Chatfield has had several mishandled pucks that have put our goalies in tough spots. He's got that explosive speed that helps make up for some of his mistakes but he's put too many unnecessary shots on our net.
canes,lxt82nv,2024-11-18 15:16:52,Is Roslovic doing well BECAUSE of Aho and Svech? Credit where credit is due anyone on the Aho and Svech line is getting points right?
canes,lxt80j6,2024-11-18 15:16:34,Ah yes. Being a point-per-game player is a clear indication that he’s not shooting the puck.
canes,lxsos1q,2024-11-18 13:39:37,They have both been doing fine assist wise but they aren’t scoring goals like they should be.  Roslovic almost has the same number of goals as Aho and Svech combined and he has 0 empty netters but Aho and Svech each have 1 apiece.
canes,lxspzcq,2024-11-18 13:45:41,Aho looks like he has no confidence in anything at the moment. He doesn’t shoot when he should his passing hasn’t been great his movements aren’t there either.
canes,lxsq84y,2024-11-18 13:46:55,Burns looks really active on defense. I agree!
canes,lxt4iue,2024-11-18 14:58:38,Yeah I think this is quite accurate. When I saw he was still the TOI leader by a healthy margin the other day I was shocked cuz I feel like Ghost and even Orlov I notice much more offensively (even off the PP) but think his defence has been really solid this season for the most part. Don’t think we should extend him unless he takes a huge paycut but also think he has still been a fine contributor. And think if Aho/Svech were playing better he would have more points.
canes,lxtc1jp,2024-11-18 15:37:06,I would guess Nikishin takes Orlovs spot and Morrow takes Burns. Rod typically doesn't play defenceman on their off side unless injury forces him to.
canes,lxsud77,2024-11-18 14:07:32,The problem with this is we already have Slavin to be the defensive defenseman on that pairing.  Part of what makes the canes so scary is their defense can hurt you if you’re not ready.  That threat isn’t there right now with Burns and Slavin on the ice.  It seems Burnsy has had a tough time holding the zone as well.  I do agree he has been solid in our own zone.
canes,lxt09co,2024-11-18 14:37:05,Were they also constantly talking about their bets they made on the game?
canes,lxt8fko,2024-11-18 15:18:43,Yeah “carrying” would be the McDavid line on the Oilers or Stone/Eichel in Vegas.
canes,lxt4288,2024-11-18 14:56:18,No way Chatfield doesn’t make mistakes on the defensive end passes out of the d-zone effectively and always races to the puck.
canes,lxtb5fb,2024-11-18 15:32:35,Well yeah that’s my point. If you look at the line totals as the lines are now their line has 19 goals and Nečas‘s line 18. You’d like to see Aho with more goals but if he ends up with 25-30 goals and 90 points and Roslovic has 40 goals you’d probably take that (not that it’s likely).
canes,lxt05qc,2024-11-18 14:36:35,Yeah Aho looks totally snake bitten so far. Not sure what’s going on but he needs to figure it out ASAP.
canes,lxti1en,2024-11-18 16:07:13,I more meant just for this season when Nikishin arrives end of year but next season and beyond your are 100% correct
canes,lxtza8s,2024-11-18 17:36:08,Morrow isn't getting slotted into the first pairing.
canes,lxta103,2024-11-18 15:26:52,Thankfully not that sounds exhausting
canes,lxt7i5f,2024-11-18 15:13:55,When he's on he's on. I think he's super underrated. I also think he's looked a little off and he's whiffed his fair share of pucks in our defensive end this season. The fact that he is able to race to the puck buys him some insurance on those mishandled pucks.All that said this season's passes out of the d-zone have looked great. Is that fair to say?
canes,lxu3iyu,2024-11-18 17:59:18,Honestly if he's not ready I wouldn't be shocked if they look for a right d in free agency.
canes,lxs27t6,2024-11-18 11:46:09,Damn that’s crazy. What else happened in the 05-06 season?
canes,lxse85q,2024-11-18 12:46:39,Necas seems like he put a lot of work into his game. In the past I think he was blaming the system/team for not giving him the room to shine and as such tried to hamfist his playstyle in ways it didn't mesh. I'm prob making up my own head canon but it seems like he took some personal responsibility because this year his play has fit so much better with the canes system while still being unmistakably Necas. I am here for it and truly believe he has the potential to be a legend.
canes,lxsf11s,2024-11-18 12:50:38,17 is a good number ngl
canes,lxs40yu,2024-11-18 11:55:18,Not a whole lot. A pretty good 31–8–2 Home record. Rod Brind'Amour was named captain. There might be something I'm missing but I think that pretty much covers it.

canes,lxsxup1,2024-11-18 14:24:59,Eric Staal got a whole season in the AHL because of the lockout after his rookie season where he tore it up. So by the time the 05-06 came around he was ready to take that next step.
canes,lxt7wnz,2024-11-18 15:16:00,Heh I get it but I would add rules changes and a lot of power plays. Staal never sniffed 100 points again. Wonder who is next on the list now after Staal. My guess would be Francis or someone from back in the Whaler days.
canes,lxsrh45,2024-11-18 13:53:05,I think winning the gold medal might have a positive impact on him. He was immense the whole tournament.
canes,lxt4of2,2024-11-18 14:59:24,I think it was kinda 50-50.  He was getting cycled around to different lines a lot last season and spent time on the fourth line for stretches.  I think rightfully so Rod felt like he couldn't trust him defensively or as a supporting player.  His skill as a lead guy has always been unquestioned but being stuck on reduced minute lines a sub-par power play unit and with wingers who couldn't play with his style was doing him no favors.  But you could see whenever he was out there after a turnover or having to backcheck there just wasn't full effort.  And he wanted to be the guy shooting not really the guy playmaking.    I think over the summer there was an understanding reached between coach and player.  Rod said show me defensive responsibility less selfish play and end to end involvement and I will give you dedicated top 6 minutes a consistent line of guys who can work with you a spot on unit 1 and permission to do your thing when you actually have the space.  Necas clearly put the work in over summer to truly adapt his game to our system and Rod met him halfway by building a line around him that still allows him to do Necas things.    The result is all the best parts of Necas' game (effortless zone entry dazzling skating ability speed and handles) are getting max minutes now but all the bad (silly turnovers puck hogging no presence on the backcheck) have been largely erased while he's on the ice.  We constantly argued over whether or not it was fair to keep Necas in a system that stifled his strengths while exposing his weaknesses but he has showed that he can cater his strengths to the system and address the weaknesses of his game.       The point production is the icing on the cake.  His shot selection is smarter and more accurate but his passing is also sharper and he's more willing to do it.  He's still a brilliant iso player and utilizes that skill but only when it makes sense and he looks comfortable being a support guy now if that's what the other team is giving him.  What it all comes down to is confidence.  The org gave him absolute full confidence and he's thriving on that.    Honorable mentions to KK and Robinson too KK's style couldn't be more different than Necas' but they seem to really compliment each other and KK's face-off presence is a big factor in puck possession time that gives Necas these opportunities.  And Robinson has taken to our system like a fish to water.  Necas' success is a factor of that whole line gelling.  Now hockey seasons are long and full of unforeseen variables but this doesn't feel like a lucky hot start.  This feels sustainable.
canes,lxsh0de,2024-11-18 13:00:30,Maybe we've got a chance for another cup against the Garlic Man.
canes,lxs4m0k,2024-11-18 11:58:15,We acquired Anton Babchuk.
canes,lxt8dhl,2024-11-18 15:18:26,He was also our best player in the Rangers series.
canes,lxt8t37,2024-11-18 15:20:39,Very well said especially the 2nd and last paragraph. That whole line is really meshing well if they and the Aho line are both playing to potential in April (and our goaltending holds up) we could finally be seeing hockey in June.

canes,lxrqcvr,2024-11-18 10:44:12,I was literally thinking last week that they should do some neutral site games.  I've enjoyed the PWHL games I watch on TV last season and look forward to a chance to see a game in person.
canes,lxrrsnu,2024-11-18 10:51:50,OMG LETS GO
canes,lxs6yi7,2024-11-18 12:10:15,I'm actually super excited for this. I feel like NC/VA could be a good expansion market for them going forward. Some of the toughest most skilled players I ever played with growing up were girls on coed teams so I'm loving watching the PWHL get started and grow.
canes,lxrrbjd,2024-11-18 10:49:19,I also enjoyed the PWHL games last season hope the league grows I knew some of the players from following the US and Canadian women's hockey team in the Olympics surprised that the Boston Fleet isn't playing at Lenovo there jerseys and identity look very similar to the Whalers.
canes,lxrt7vv,2024-11-18 10:59:23,Great watching the pwhl last year online hope that continues. Wonder when tickets will go on sale?
canes,lxs45bh,2024-11-18 11:55:54,Raleigh is definitely the outlier market of the bunch in looking forward to it!

canes,lxtl1dd,2024-11-18 16:22:13,Really hope this is them scoping out markets for expansion cause I would be SO DOWN for a PWHL team in NC!

canes,lxtm2wf,2024-11-18 16:27:29,The Montreal - Boston game is the matchup in this series with the best jerseys. They're the only jerseys I'd spend money on at the moment
canes,lxqrcra,2024-11-18 06:52:23,He's the Necas we wanted but not the Necas we deserved.
canes,lxqum4l,2024-11-18 07:20:29,His talent and potential was always there but quite frankly until this year something was missing.
canes,lxqxj8m,2024-11-18 07:43:47,To be fair the trade rumours weren't based on dislike or disappointment in Necas it was more about getting an A1 forward for a Cup run. Maybe Necas turned out to be that guy after all.
canes,lxqyzt0,2024-11-18 07:54:46,That near death experience from Captain elbow in the playoffs ignited a new era of Necas
canes,lxqxbt6,2024-11-18 07:42:10,>I can’t believe so many caniacs wanted a tradeNot to knock Necas but he’s been in the League for 8 seasons (full time 6) and this is the first that we’ve seen *this*. He’s a 0.7 point/game player that’s turned into a 1.7 point/game player overnight. I don’t even think the Hurricanes saw that coming.Don’t knock other caniacs for not seeing the invisible.
canes,lxqx51b,2024-11-18 07:40:45,He’s got so much talent and now he’s got the confidence and maturity. It’s awesome watching him play.
canes,lxqyqft,2024-11-18 07:52:50,I never doubted him. He’s been my fave player since he joined us.
canes,lxqvjgo,2024-11-18 07:28:04,No one could possibly say they saw this coming. He looks like a totally different player this year.
canes,lxqxopf,2024-11-18 07:44:58,If people actually paid attention to him on the ice rather than when he turns over the puck you would’ve seen how much potential he has. Dude is captivating to watch just from his skating ability.
canes,lxqyr44,2024-11-18 07:52:59,I never doubted him. He’s been my fave player since he joined us.
canes,lxqzxm4,2024-11-18 08:01:40,Guentzel who?
canes,lxr9ug8,2024-11-18 09:08:14,Necas has been great.  Something I noticed different about his game this year is his forecheck and commitment to board battles.  He has been much more disruptive and is coming away with a lot more pucks compared to previous seasons.  That’s the type of play that gives you a longer leash with Rod and by nature of puck possession keeps you in the offensive zone more often.  Robinson has helped in this regard as well.  Last year our 2nd line was bogged down in the defensive zone much more often.Another big change this year is stacking Necas on PP1 and giving them the majority of the power play time.  It’s a strategy that almost all the best power plays in the NHL use.  A third of his points have come on the PP this season.
canes,lxrb21y,2024-11-18 09:15:53,Scared of him getting complacent when he gets the bag but enjoying him playing for said bag.
canes,lxrl9vq,2024-11-18 10:16:22,See flair
canes,lxs5ott,2024-11-18 12:03:46,He’s finally living up to the potential! It’s wild that some fans were calling for a trade just last season.
canes,lxs894u,2024-11-18 12:16:48,Some of us never doubted him
canes,lxsevtw,2024-11-18 12:49:55,and MacKinnon is only 1st cause the Avs have gotten an extra game in over us.so happy to see him take that next step hope Necas can keep up this pace for the whole season
canes,lxseyy0,2024-11-18 12:50:20,Never underestimate the power of confidence. I think winning the world championships for his country last year gave him the self belief to go along with all that talent he already had. I’ve always liked his game. Let’s hope he keeps this going!!!
canes,lxqzkxy,2024-11-18 07:59:04,Jesus fuck he's on fire right now. He's making an argument for a huge raise when his bridge deal expires
canes,lxr97pd,2024-11-18 09:04:10,Rod has always been supportive of Necas but before now his talent had gotten lost over the last few years. You have to remember its business not personal. They are getting paid to perform and perform well.
canes,lxqzqyv,2024-11-18 08:00:18,You spelled second wrong.
canes,lxr23g8,2024-11-18 08:17:04,It's not only that Caniacs wanted a trade. Tulsky was actively shopping him and Necas killed trades to at least Columbus and Winnipeg. If anything this more vindicates Waddell for offering #4 Overall for extended Necas
canes,lxr2n3w,2024-11-18 08:20:51,Necas has always had talent and potential but I don’t think anyone including our front office could have ever anticipated him becoming _this_ good. He’s producing at more than double the rate that he has been in pretty much every other season of his career. If he keeps up this level of play we’re gonna have to give him a big payday.
canes,lxr58n8,2024-11-18 08:38:23,I won't claim I always knew that he had this in him but I will say he has always been incredibly fun to watch. This obviously take it up a notch.
canes,lxr7xap,2024-11-18 08:55:55,This is definitely some recency bias. We all knew the talent was there but his ability to show it on the ice has been very Inconsistent over his tenure. Part of that can be attributed to it being difficult finding linemates not in the same boat or who are consistent but can't match his speed and style. But I think overall this team is gelling much better than the one last season and the player most benefitting from that is Necas. And as stated by the team any trade would have to be an equal player trade he wouldn't go for a low pick or prospect
canes,lxrdsrs,2024-11-18 09:32:47,The thing is when we have gaps certain players step up to fill those gaps periodically. Let's see how he is doing mid to end season to get a good assessment of his performance.
canes,lxrgheh,2024-11-18 09:48:54,With the cap increase coming and Orlov’s contract coming off the books I hope we can reach a long term deal if bridges haven’t been burned.
canes,lxrj664,2024-11-18 10:04:28,Last year not being that great for him is such an overblown narrative. His 5v5 numbers were practically identical between 22-23 and 23-24. He played nearly 100 fewer minutes on the PP in 23-24 and still scored about as many goals. It was the PP assist numbers that dropped significantly (17 to 5).
canes,lxrzuts,2024-11-18 11:34:11,There’s an argument that the Canes losing in the 2nd round last year was actually a positive for the Canes and has had an enormous impact on Necas.Getting to participate and be a big part of the gold medal Czechia team really helped to boost his confidence this year. Not to mention the experience gained with different guys and in his home country to boot.
canes,lxs5cu9,2024-11-18 12:02:03,Imagine if we traded him and he was doing this for a rival 
canes,lxsgipt,2024-11-18 12:58:03,Having a faster team with better skating passing and shooting talent has really helped - particularly because Necas isn't the only one making controlled zone entry anymore. It's really hard for skating talent to shine when you're dumping and chasing at the rate the Canes have the past couple years particularly for someone like Necas who isn't a big board battle grinder. Necas's lines have been taking the puck through the neutral zone to the net at speed which allows Necas to show off his cutting/spinning ability and also opens up assist chances and good shots even when he doesn't make entry himself. Jarvis is the other guy who I think will really benefit from this change if he stays healthy. He's been good but similarly to Necas it often felt like he was having to hold back - he doesn't need to anymore.
canes,lxsn4ya,2024-11-18 13:31:21,Does this mean we’re looking to keep him for the long run? Or is this his likely last season for us?
canes,lxu99nm,2024-11-18 18:32:19,I think he's neat
canes,lxqypbk,2024-11-18 07:52:36,But who are we going to have to trade to keep him?
canes,lxrte1u,2024-11-18 11:00:17,I have to be honest over the past couple years I thought he was a puck hog terrible passing and shooting but this guy has absolutely rocked this year so far!
canes,lxs2wpe,2024-11-18 11:49:39,I feel so bad. My preference was to keep Guentzel and let Necas go in a trade. I'm so glad I was dead wrong trust in Tulsky and Rod!
canes,lxraw3q,2024-11-18 09:14:51,Give me a #Fuck TroubaBut also I guess thank you if it was the origin story for super necas.
canes,lxqzwhn,2024-11-18 08:01:26,I think people will (rightfully so) point out that he's a player who needs a specific system to flourish. I think it's taken a while for the Canes to figure out how best to use him. He's also been streaky at times so it's no doubt good timing
canes,lxrdl1q,2024-11-18 09:31:29,It shouldn't be a huge surprise. Yes he's been in the league 8 seasons but that's very unfair to him when you actually look at the seasons.In his first two seasons (17-18 and 18-19) he played in 8 games total.Then his next two seasons just fucked his development because of COVID. He didn't get the very important off-season after his first full season to really learn the offense and get to know the other players and just generally train with everyone.Then he had 71 points in 22-23 (including 21 through 17 games) and started off strong last year before getting injured.This is his best start but not by a ton (he's also got the benefit of playing on a higher scoring offense yes partly because of him but also because of better line mates). He's been given a little more freedom now that Rod is more comfortable with his decision making. His issue has never been his offense when he is playing good it's always been his decisions and effort when he isn't scoring. Good players are great when they feel good and a liability when they're not. Great players are great when they feel good but you can still trust them not to hurt the team when they're not.
canes,lxrygbk,2024-11-18 11:26:56,EXACTLY!I came here to say exactly this.I was one of the many fans that wanted him traded but rightfully so. This season he’s FINALLY performing to the expectations we’ve had for 6+ years.Don’t give me wrong I’m happy and I sure hope he can keep this up but you can’t knock people for running out of patience with him.
canes,lxrk7ug,2024-11-18 10:10:24,Indeed! I've acted like his proud Momma thru his career here :)
canes,lxrau5a,2024-11-18 09:14:31,No. People could.Using eyes and not just stat sheets you could see how high his ceiling was but just not there yet.He may be over performing right now but there are plenty that could see moving on from him would have been a massive mistake. It appears the coaching staff tweaked some things thus what and it's putting necas into his wheelhouse. TBD on how it's affecting ahu svech etc long term.
canes,lxr0y4e,2024-11-18 08:08:59,I think people actually watched and saw that and he wasn’t playing to his potential. He is now.
canes,lxr2qcg,2024-11-18 08:21:29,Guentzel will never win a championship w the lightning
canes,lxsz14r,2024-11-18 14:30:52,People were cooking up trades because it seemed like he didn’t want to be here anymore.
canes,lxr4pu1,2024-11-18 08:34:55,Can't be that big of a raise as he already makes $6.5 million0% chance Necas would ever make more than Aho at $9.75 million
canes,lxr3rtz,2024-11-18 08:28:37,Nobody if he wants to stay  The Cap is going up to $100+ million over the next 2 years which gives plenty of space. Even if Necas hits 100 points this year he still only rates ~$9 million on a long-term deal.  If he wants Pastrnak money then trade him for a haul to a team that will pay him that. Necas is great but he's not an $11+ million player. He's still benefitting from Aho and Staal always getting the toughest assignments.
canes,lxqzm50,2024-11-18 07:59:18,DOES NOT MATTER
canes,lxr55i7,2024-11-18 08:37:48,People keep saying this about the system but tbh I don’t think Rod changed the system at all this year. Honestly Necas is playing like he always has played (he’s always been great with space) the big difference is he’s been more responsible with the puck. He always did those cutbacks it’s just they used to always be turnovers lol. Also his shots are going in the back of the net. I personally never wanted to trade him just because he’s young and I think he has a high upside and I think he’s been steadily improving over the last three seasons.
canes,lxr3s9x,2024-11-18 08:28:42,putting him back on pp1 is a good start
canes,lxs4vhr,2024-11-18 11:59:36,I didn't want him traded.but i saw the argument for it.
canes,lxs4y28,2024-11-18 11:59:57,He's more than doubled his previous output.
canes,lxr55ul,2024-11-18 08:37:52,At the risk of being argumentative a 3m annual raise would both be significant for Necas and still put him below Aho
canes,lxr7biy,2024-11-18 08:52:00,I agreeAs well as Necas has been playing Tulsky is a moneyball guy.I assume we enter contract talks at the end of this season and if Necas asks for 10-11+ I would not at all rule out us looking to trade him again like you said
canes,lxr6z04,2024-11-18 08:49:44,I could well be wrong but I think the system has opened up a bit and become more flexible. Canes were never about pretty hockey they were all about grinding but this year there seems to be a bit more movement.That said it could just be talent. Those stretch and east-west passes which weren’t working out in previous years are connecting every time.
canes,lxs4la7,2024-11-18 11:58:08,I think you could argue that we're *more* of a system team. WE're going faster and stronger than last season without Turbo (slower) and quickie who's mobile but neither big nor super fast.Now we're going to North/South so fast that it creates more space in the middle to allow Necas to make those plays.
canes,lxsf6ya,2024-11-18 12:51:26,I think it's half Necas anticipating his teammates better half his teammates anticipating him better. The team is faster and better at making zone entry under control so now Necas isn't the only one flying through the neutral zone and getting stuck all by himself and turning it over - his linemates are actually keeping up this year. He's also doing a better job of picking his spots for when his cuts are going to open up trailing teammates.
canes,lxs4sq8,2024-11-18 11:59:12,it made perfect sense that he was on PP2 last season. We had a top 3 PP in the league because we had by far the best 2nd unit in the league. The issue is of course that didn't work in the playoffs and now we've said fuck it pp1 all the way. One benefit here is that Ghost is QB rather than Burns which probably works well with Necas better but also keeps Burns fresher.
canes,lxs5tiw,2024-11-18 12:04:26,Yes during a small sample size so far. So he may be over performing and regress to the mean but I'd wager his new mean is still a significant bump from his past few years.His potential was always there and FO obviously made the right call.
canes,lxr6a9a,2024-11-18 08:45:15,If the Canes can get Aho Necas Jarvis and Svech locked in for a combined $34-35 million then they would be in very good shapeThat leaves a ton of money to add another Superstar on top of filling out the defense and net sufficiently
canes,lxreiev,2024-11-18 09:37:09,The team is in desperate need of high end talent. You don’t draft and patiently develop said talent only to let him walk. There’s definitely a point at which you walk away or maybe challenge him to do it again next year but this team doesn’t have the luxury of walking away from point per game scorers in their prime.
canes,lxtolb8,2024-11-18 16:40:13,I don't think the system has changed one bit. But the speed and puck-handling has overall Ghost allows more zone entries and Necas is more controlled. The result is fewer dump-ins. A possession part team always wants to keep possession into the zone but there were personnel issues limiting it in past years.
canes,lxs640b,2024-11-18 12:05:55,right wasn't saying it didn't make sense but the majority of his fall off last season was directly related to not getting pp1 minutes. his 5v5 scoring was basically the same past two seasons despite spending the majority of last season with his most common linemates being drury and bunting/noesen rather than svech/teuvo
canes,lxs6okq,2024-11-18 12:08:50,"right we could all see he had another level. I just think anyone that said ""his next level will be htis season and he'll be top 3 in the league"" was lying to themselves.Yes i agree that he'll regress to the mean a bit and i'm so glad he's ours. Need to get him a new contract."
canes,lxrgorh,2024-11-18 09:50:06,True. And I’m not saying that would necessarily be the right choice I just think it’s a possible outcomeI definitely agree that we need a high end talent. We have tons of great two way players but at some point you need someone you can rely on point wise… hopefully Necas can be that guy
canes,lxs6reo,2024-11-18 12:09:14,I was just adding context. 100% agree.
canes,lxpqgkz,2024-11-18 00:31:10,Now do Necas vs Guentzel 
canes,lxplefk,2024-11-17 23:50:33,It's like we have a good coach and system
canes,lxpm6dm,2024-11-17 23:56:27,Super happy for Brady for getting paid.
canes,lxqz5b7,2024-11-18 07:55:54,Is it though?Ghost plays PP1 for the Canes and has 9/13 points there.  The Canes PP2 has scored zero goals for reference.Skjei plays PP2 for Nashville which also sucks. Skjei has 4 5v5 points vs Ghost's 2.Ghost is a lot better PP specialist and Skjei is a lot better 5v5 player. Always has been.
canes,lxpq4uq,2024-11-18 00:28:23,Not exactly a fair comparison since Nashville is off to such a terrible start and the canes a very hot one.Skjei is comparable 5v5 offensively to Ghost while being much better defensively imo.  Ghost much better on the power play for sure.The Ghost/Walker pairing is working better than I ever hoped defensively.
canes,lxpmuqe,2024-11-18 00:01:38,Bastian Schweinsteiger

canes,lxq5xvd,2024-11-18 03:03:23,For all the same reasons being discussed are why we are not very active during the trade deadline for the playoffs.
canes,lxrxovy,2024-11-18 11:22:57,"I used to factor in a ""post trade interview"" assessment for my fantasy leagues where I would watch the players talk and try to get a sense of whether I thought they would like the system they were traded into.Or if they were just traded to Carolina."
canes,lxr17qg,2024-11-18 08:10:54,Ghost is noticably a better utility defender in this system now that he's the true offensive defense QB
canes,lxr2g7a,2024-11-18 08:19:32,https://i.redd.it/16rafjxsun1e1.gif
canes,lxrnp2p,2024-11-18 10:29:45,Skeji would probably have similar stats to Ghost and Orlov here.
canes,lxqrqip,2024-11-18 06:55:48,I swear redditors have the shortest attention spans. Ghost did the same thing when we signed him last time then he dropped off the face of the earth for the rest of the season. Time WILL tell. Any player can string together a good 20/30 game pace. But can they do it for 82? The Canes have never had a problem with players scoring and doing well. But they always have a problem with consistency. Either during the season or in the playoffs. Call me a skeptic but I won’t say we’ve solved anything until I see they can keep their pace up in the playoffs.
canes,lxpv2e7,2024-11-18 01:12:34,ghost is the best defenseman on the canes and it ain’t even close
canes,lxplr5g,2024-11-17 23:53:18,The secret side benefit of a good coach and system across all sports is being able to sell your players for above their value because they look really good with you
canes,lxppa5u,2024-11-18 00:21:13,Agree I hate seeing players leave but I'm generally happy when they get a bag for themselves. Also Skjei is playing on a team that is struggling hard to figure themselves out. Don't think he's the problem on the Preds
canes,lxrkl8w,2024-11-18 10:12:32,Big change coming from last years lack of special teams in the playoffs
canes,lxrfavd,2024-11-18 09:41:54,It's also a sick fuckin pairing name
canes,lxs87s8,2024-11-18 12:16:36,tbf Skjei and Ghost are both part of each team's terrible and hot starts respectively.
canes,lxr0l22,2024-11-18 08:06:22,“Unexpected” (and in this case good!)
canes,lxs32yy,2024-11-18 11:50:32,We should trade for Skjei!
canes,lxs8ir8,2024-11-18 12:18:08,I think Ghost is a better PP1QB than Skjei.Skjei is serviceable as a PP2 but his movement across the blue line i don't remember being wowed by. Skjei is overall a better player
canes,lxquwmo,2024-11-18 07:22:55,Agree. He started off hot then went 5 or 6 games eh now has gotten a couple pts last couple games. I like him and glad he’s here but yea everyone breathe. He’s on the third line for a reason. BUT he is a welcome addition to the PP.
canes,lxqes8v,2024-11-18 04:42:54,Brother what?
canes,lxrf8lg,2024-11-18 09:41:31,You misspelled Slavin.
canes,lxpnwdh,2024-11-18 00:09:57,Every player who ever left the patriots for 10 years lol
canes,lxs82f6,2024-11-18 12:15:51,One thing i like is that there hasn't really been a player that has left without either getting considerably more money (Skjei Trocheck Dougie) or someone we weren't dying to come back (turbo). All the players we've had leave have done it because they wanted more money. Which is 100% fine. No hard feelings.It sucked when we were bad and players would leave just to get out of here.
canes,lxs9reg,2024-11-18 12:24:21,Yes by definition they are a part of each team’s start because they are both logging big minutes.Ghost has been great but we have a lot of players playing at or above their career best.  Necas Roslovic Robinson and Martinook alongside Ghost just to name a few.Skjei is not the reason Nashville is struggling.  That responsibility can pretty solely land on the forward group that can’t seem to mesh as their defense hasn’t been bad but the offense has been league worst.
canes,lxs4jkd,2024-11-18 11:57:54,hey we get him for a 5th with 50% retained salary.  Pull the trigger!
canes,lxrgdlm,2024-11-18 09:48:16,To be fair he's a ghost so he was buffed during the month of October

canes,lxsa1uk,2024-11-18 12:25:48,agreed 100%Did you see the overtime when he lost his edge though? That was sad.to be clear Skjei is a better player than Ghost. But at 3v7m i'd take ghost for 3rd line and PP1
canes,lxs6k0u,2024-11-18 12:08:12,Sounds reasonable 
canes,lxqhe2b,2024-11-18 05:11:44,Poor Raiders. It's no wonder they all got attached to the Golden Knights so quick lmao
canes,lxscha7,2024-11-18 12:37:59,Yes I caught that highlight very sad indeed.You’re absolutely right we are getting basically max value out of Ghost.  I really respect how Walker is contributing to Ghost’s success as well.  Walker is also an offensive minded defenseman who seems to be okay with changing his role to be the more responsible defenseman in their pairing.  He’s done that job really well and it’s pretty selfless of him.
canes,lxqx3n1,2024-11-18 07:40:27,The Golden Knights also got their first

canes,lxool0x,2024-11-17 20:16:14,I’m just happy Necas is proving me wrong cause I was fully prepared for another meh year. Proud he has shown up and shown out
canes,lxoo5vo,2024-11-17 20:13:39,I would never. I’ve said he’s looking like something between a McDavid and a Kucherov and I’m getting vindicated with every passing game
canes,lxotn1p,2024-11-17 20:47:16,"I made this comment over the off-season on a post regarding Guentzel. So glad it is coming true so far and to see Necas thrive! Here's knocking on wood not jinxing anything but here were my off-season thoughts that I stand by now more than ever:Perhaps unpopular take but thinking big picture I like how things worked out being able to keep Necas. I loved watching Guentzel but I don't think he was ultimately that ""go out and get a goal"" scorer we needed and as someone else commented a number of his goals were empty netters. At the end of the end of the day in the playoffs both he and Necas scored 9 pts on 4 goals and 5 assists and Necas wasn't on the first line either. If the team and Necas can truly turn a page and refocus this year I'll take a younger Necas who still has additional upside at a lower cap hit than being locked in with Guentzel for 8 years especially when his production may not remain constant those last years of his contract. If Necas really does feel like the Canes are home to him and works to get back to where he was a couple of years ago I think he can be that guy for the team."
canes,lxouonp,2024-11-17 20:53:39,Many of us have said for years that he skates likes McDavid but he could never quite get his hands to follow up. But he's found that clicking now as well.
canes,lxp1vpf,2024-11-17 21:38:18,I remember getting chewed out when I said we should prioritize Necas over Guentzel…. Loving his form. Will be very happy if he can finish the year with a point per game average.
canes,lxp0um2,2024-11-17 21:31:53,the past few years I've been saying Necas is a good player and that if he ever got consistent in his goal scoring he'd be one of the best in the league.this year he has gotten consistent and now looks like one of the best players in the league
canes,lxp3hxg,2024-11-17 21:48:14,I love the enthusiasm.Their skating abilities are similar even though McDavid is 15lbs heavier (a testament to how freakish McDavid’s skating is).  McDavid’s puck handling is what really separates him.  Necas most of the time has to rely on his speed to go around people to the outside or cut back whereas McDavid can weave right through the heart of the defense.  Necas is probably a more natural shooter though.
canes,lxph88o,2024-11-17 23:20:26,"""Looks like"" is not a crazy thing to say. He's definitely at a different level this year. Would be a certain All Star if that was a thing this season and it's a shame the Czechs are not going to be represented within the 4 nations."
canes,lxowt7f,2024-11-17 21:06:48,After the Flyers game I texted a buddy and made the comparison that no one can take over a game like McDavid but I was suggesting Necas had ascended to that level with his performance in that game.  I don't think you're crazy.  We just all hope he can sustain this.
canes,lxozo5p,2024-11-17 21:24:31,Always has.
canes,lxpfox4,2024-11-17 23:09:24,Personally if the ice rink was bigger and he had more space he'd be a demon. Just look at how he plays on the 3v3 he's great.
canes,lxpo7nf,2024-11-18 00:12:28,I don't really see a McDavid comparison. McJesus is more of a power forward to me.  I realize this is going too far back for most of you but when he's *really* flying the guy Necas reminds me of the most is Teemu Selänne.
canes,lxqu2gs,2024-11-18 07:15:55,I wouldn't go that far but Necas has some skills McDavid doesn't.
canes,lxreoha,2024-11-18 09:38:09,Oh you mean that bum that's second in scoring on a team that's 2 games over .500? Why are you disrespecting Necas like that?
canes,lxoundm,2024-11-17 20:53:26,Mainly not turning over the puck as much and passing it at timely moments more often. Just those 2 things have contributed so much to his game.
canes,lxooqij,2024-11-17 20:17:10,True
canes,lxouux6,2024-11-17 20:54:43,Yeah as a Hybrid Canes/Bolts fan (blame my SO) I have noticed Kucherov-like playmaking with some dancey-dance skating skills.
canes,lxp4fw6,2024-11-17 21:54:06,I think we shouldn't boo Guentzel anymore. Dude did us a huge favor.
canes,lxp7m5d,2024-11-17 22:14:32,You cooked I fear
canes,lxrf8qu,2024-11-18 09:41:33,Also Neci is 25 and Guentz is 30
canes,lxp0obd,2024-11-17 21:30:47,The difference is Mcdavid does this every game for 7 straight years 
canes,lxq0qn3,2024-11-18 02:07:57,Almost like he grew up playing most of his career on an international sized rink.No shade intended just kind of funny.Necas looks so much better this year because offensive zone possessions are much longer.  He isn't making near the degree of boneheaded offensive zone or entry turnovers.The skating agility speed and hands have been there the whole time he's been a cane. Glad he's taken a step up in maturity and hope he remains consistent he's been a force so far.
canes,lxp83u8,2024-11-17 22:17:43,I feel that having Guentzel on our team for that last half of last season was the bit of mentorship for Necas that has elevated him to the next level.
canes,lxs6ulr,2024-11-18 12:09:42,"You think Guentzel mentored him and that unlocked his current level? Seriously doubt that for a number of reasons. Necas has always had this in him that is why we have always been excited about his ""potential"". Necas and Guentzel do not play a similar style. Guentzel also doesn't strike me as the mentor type especially not coming into an established competitive team as a rental."
canes,lxqless,2024-11-18 05:54:46,Lululemon bags are acceptable
canes,lxowoj2,2024-11-17 21:06:00,Small bag is best. They have never precisely measured my bag but its like 5x7. You also have your coat pockets which helps even if you just bring a coat to have more storage space.
canes,lxov5pg,2024-11-17 20:56:35,They have a sheet of paper they'll compare. They are very strict every time I tried to bring a bag in. They don't mess around with it.
canes,lxoxjud,2024-11-17 21:11:24,so i actually end up using the little pouch that comes in this [anthropology bag](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/the-hollace-tote-mini-edition?category=bags&color=001&type=STANDARD&size=One+Size&quantity=1) since it has the loops i can attach a strap to and it is large enough to fit keys migraine meds (hello friend!) and a small card holder into (pnc is cashless) and i’ve never had a problem with it. i always carry earbuds with me too and have room to spare so i’m sure you could get an inhaler in there no problem. i do have to put it in one of the bins that gets x-rayed but it’s worth the extra time for me and even then i barely take a minute longer than the friends who just walk right in without bags. if you’re not looking to spend that much on essentially what is an extra item i recommend trying tj maxx and marshall’s and looking in the wallet sections because there are usually pouch type bags there! kipling has some good quality stuff and i feel like especially around the holidays you see smaller style bags since they’re popular for people to take to parties. enjoy your first game!!
canes,lxp00fv,2024-11-17 21:26:36,"My wife took in a clear bag probably near 8"" x 11"" a week or two ago and nobody said a thing. It sounds like others here have had different experiences so I obviously can't promise you it won't be a problem. We didn't realize the bag limitations until we were in line to scan tickets and obviously already had the bag with us. But again nobody even looked at it twice."
canes,lxqtx3k,2024-11-18 07:14:40,Lululemon everywhere belt bag (EBB) 1L or the small festival bags are okay. That’s typically what I use. I know they will allow larger bags if you have a baby or medical needs and they go through a bag scanner and specific entrances. There will be signs for X Ray machine. The Lulu bags make everything super simple since you can sling it over your body. I know a lot of companies are making similar bags now. If I’m not bringing a bag I typically just shove it everything in coat pockets. I’ll shove a couple migraine pills or pepto bismol in the pockets along with my ID and a credit card or two. When I go through the scanner I then put my coat in the bin and just tell them I have keys and AirPods in there and nobody has said anything.
canes,lxr7l5e,2024-11-18 08:53:45,I found a too small for everyday bag that can hold glasses phone DL and chapstick. Some employees will measure and it’s not worth the risk of having to hike back across the parking lotWhich reminds me I need to purge the clear now too large bags that I got when that was acceptable
canes,lxoyq7y,2024-11-17 21:18:40,"I just ask because I've found a couple things that might work but they're off by .5-1"" at most in either dimension. And I'll definitely have a coat or jacket but I'll have to make sure it's the one with zip pockets. Thanks!"
canes,lxoz38q,2024-11-17 21:20:55,If there's a chance they'll measure I'll play it safe. I understand they've got a job to do and I appreciate it but I'd also like to meet whoever it was that came up with 4.5 x 6.5  as the ideal dimensions lol.

canes,lxp35bp,2024-11-17 21:46:05,I looked to see if they had any policy about clear bags. It's odd the main page about the bag policy from Lenovo center (and the one linked on the Canes website) says nothing about clear bags being allowed. But the text underneath the link on the Cane's page says clear bags are allowed. I kinda assumed they just forgot to update it (there are several places that still list the current season as 23-24) but I wonder if they don't have a policy against clear bags but don't want to encourage them either. Either way thanks for the input!
canes,lxoyz6m,2024-11-17 21:20:14,Yeah they aren't super strict as long as you are close they haven't stopped me. Happy to help!

If Necas has only one fan then that is me. If Necas has no fans then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Necas then I am against the world.
canes,lxol5m6,2024-11-17 19:55:24,SCILENCED THE BROWN NOTES! Shame Necas didn't get the hat but he's the fastest Cane to reach 30 points passing the elder Staal who did it in 18 games! Glad to see PK back in net and holding it down after that scare the other night. The Robinson KK Necas line is a damn MACHINE and they need to stay together all season.Necas for Hart!Bring on Philly!

canes,lxoqg2c,2024-11-17 20:27:39,I could sit here and preach about how their confidence in themselves is helping their play about how there is more to be proud of beyond winning games and how they are not only one of the best teams on the ice but off as well. But I won’t because I could write an essay. For now GO CANES!!!!!
canes,lxow1ny,2024-11-17 21:02:02,I couldn’t watch this game:( did my baby PK pass the eye test tonight?
canes,lxorqey,2024-11-17 20:35:33,Great win. Felt kinda bad for Hofer after that last dime from Necas lol
canes,lxond7x,2024-11-17 20:08:48,We’re now #2 in the league (let’s be honest though we already were) and #1 is my ECHL team’s affiliate. While I’d like to see those places switch it’s all cool.
canes,lxp7r6k,2024-11-17 22:15:27,Ngl I was a little worried about this game once the Blues came out and we looked flat as hell. Couldn't get anything rolling but as soon as we tied it I had a feeling we were cooking. I was not expecting a 2G 2A night for Neci. That dude is on another level entirely right now and I couldn't be happier for him. It's so fun to think that if AllStars was right now he'd be our team rep 100%.
canes,lxoki30,2024-11-17 19:51:28,Necas should just embrace it and in the post game interview when asked how he does it or how he's feeling just say that it's all because of the blonde hair.

sabres,lxs4aoj,2024-11-18 11:56:40,Fine by me. Give him 1-3 **full** seasons as an Amerk.Ryan Miller was a full time Amerk until he was 25 FYI. His first full season in Buffalo was 05-06 after 3 full seasons in Rochester.Goalies have long careers. Many reach their prime well into their 30's. Give the dude time.
sabres,lxs1m5u,2024-11-18 11:43:07,Seemed to be an inevitability. His numbers haven’t been good enough to warrant playing a backup role. Not all of it was his fault it seemed like the team shit the bed in front of him a lot but he was also getting beaten clean a few too many times. He’ll be back.
sabres,lxs8ymu,2024-11-18 12:20:21,Keep him there for the rest of the season. Dude still needs a few years of seasoning
sabres,lxs1zcm,2024-11-18 11:44:58,Best thing for his development. Leave him there for the season.
sabres,lxs9c8y,2024-11-18 12:22:16,This is welcome news! I’ve been waiting for this.
sabres,lxs2vy4,2024-11-18 11:49:32,I hate it but I understand it’s best
sabres,lxs5ql9,2024-11-18 12:04:01,Good move. He's not ready for the NHL yet. Let him develop and see how it goes.
sabres,lxs63td,2024-11-18 12:05:53, Keep him down there he’s getting grill marks for getting cooked so much
sabres,lxs68nq,2024-11-18 12:06:35,Seems like he was at his best when he was playing a bunch of games in college then came right to the team. He needs consistent starts to get into a groove and improve. This will be a good thing
sabres,lxs32b2,2024-11-18 11:50:26,He will be all the better for it in the long run
sabres,lxs3cvh,2024-11-18 11:51:54,Right move. He needs to play consistently for his growth and gain his confidence back after his shaky start this season
sabres,lxs2fup,2024-11-18 11:47:18,Good. Lets him play games and I'm sure we'll see him back in the show again soon.
sabres,lxscahn,2024-11-18 12:37:02,bout time! Amerks gonna win the Calder Cup this year
sabres,lxsm4bh,2024-11-18 13:26:17,Good not sure why we got away from Developing goalies in the A for 3-5 years. That position takes time.
sabres,lxt7eu7,2024-11-18 15:13:26,He's been getting beat clean on shots an NHL goalie should stop.  Going to be a big part of the future for us but his time isn't now.
sabres,lxs34tz,2024-11-18 11:50:46,If he making room for someone?
sabres,lxs6u42,2024-11-18 12:09:38,Don't like the circumstances around it. Still the right decision. Get some regular game time get adjusted to regular hockey at a good level and come back stronger. Fingers crossed. Like the kid and there's definitely something there.
sabres,lxskqw4,2024-11-18 13:19:25,Needed to happen. At this point in his development he needs to play regularly have no problems with it. I think Reimer is a short term upgrade and someone we’re ok with playing sparingly. Levi will get his games and he’s the 1st goalie up from Rochester if UPL goes down
sabres,lxswrdg,2024-11-18 14:19:30,Probably for the best. I see potential in the guy He's made some clutch saves but I saw a goalie chart earlier and he's bottom 5 in the league. Just needs some more ice time.
sabres,lxswy7s,2024-11-18 14:20:27,He should benefit tremendously from going to the AHL and will come back a true force in net
sabres,lxt2gmi,2024-11-18 14:48:13,Finally
sabres,lxt30j7,2024-11-18 14:51:00,he should have spent all of last year and this year in Rochester. hopefully his development path hasn't been screwed up too badly
sabres,lxt48em,2024-11-18 14:57:11,Amerks are going to be deadly
sabres,lxtlznt,2024-11-18 16:27:03,Good needed. Let him be the man there for the rest of the season at least.
sabres,lxsh4nl,2024-11-18 13:01:06,Lindy consistently making logical moves.
sabres,lxs4284,2024-11-18 11:55:28,Took a year and a quarter.... hope he catches up on his development and doesn't need to be called up again this year.  I think Sabres already hurt his potential.
sabres,lxs7kbe,2024-11-18 12:13:19,Yep no indictment on his potential or future. UPL is going to play the majority of games so give Levi ice time.
sabres,lxsj6ah,2024-11-18 13:11:30,This is it. Let him thrive for a while. I still think he’ll be great. He’s been good but it’s not helpful to develop a goalie when he’s getting all these odd man rushes and back door taps
sabres,lxsj8yo,2024-11-18 13:11:52,1-3 full seasons in the AHL is how you make an AHL goalie not an NHL goalie. It's rare to have that career progression from multiple years in the AHL to the NHL - it's a lot more common for goalies to do maybe a season in the AHL to show that they're the real deal and then move up to do 25-30 NHL games as a backup for 1-3 years.It's just not the same for goalies as it is for skaters; AHL habits for goalies are more negative they don't work against NHL shooters. There's almost nothing to be learned by getting sent down at best you're just killing time till there's an opening at the NHL level. Like Miller - he had to do that extra year in the AHL cause of the lockout.
sabres,lxs49rb,2024-11-18 11:56:32,I just hate with all my being that Reimer is our backup.Detroit just waived Jack Campbell. Waive Reimer and get Campbell with us. He's better anyway.
sabres,lxs7n7d,2024-11-18 12:13:43,He’s been literally the worst goalie in the league. not good enough may be a bit of an understatement.
sabres,lxsj1u4,2024-11-18 13:10:52,Too shaky and overcommits causing him to be way out of position too often. Flashes of greatness but absolutely let the man season in Rochester. GMKA should be making a trade for a 1B or high end backup. Easier said than done of course
sabres,lxtadsg,2024-11-18 15:28:40,Yes. But should've  done this last year. He would have benefited more already.
sabres,lxs9n2c,2024-11-18 12:23:45,I bet they bring him up several times this season…especially home back-to-backs.
sabres,lxs3yo6,2024-11-18 11:54:58,Development?? Bro’s been developing for 3 years and he’s 22. How long does he need??
sabres,lxsnkws,2024-11-18 13:33:34,Bizarrely this has somehow become a controversial statement lol
sabres,lxs3f6o,2024-11-18 11:52:14,Probably Riemer will be backup for now
sabres,lxslk1m,2024-11-18 13:23:28,Rosen recalled
sabres,lxs66mc,2024-11-18 12:06:17,This was the obvious move from the moment they first signed Reimer. It made no sense to either take starts away from UPL or to prevent Levi from playing regularly. Honestly I was high on Levi to start and I still think he has a high ceiling but the Sabres should be trying to figure out if UPL can be the guy and then working at boosting Levi’s trade value.
sabres,lxsc9sz,2024-11-18 12:36:57,There's no way your potential is hurt by having a couple bad games in the NHL at 22 years old.
sabres,lxscpk8,2024-11-18 12:39:07,he'll get great ice time on a competitive AHL team
sabres,lxsrfcc,2024-11-18 13:52:50,> It's rare to have that career progression from multiple years in the AHL to the NHL - it's a lot more common for goalies to do maybe a season in the AHL to show that they're the real deal and then move up to do 25-30 NHL games as a backup for 1-3 years.I don't have time to do it but I'd bet that if you sorted through the data you'd find that these two factual assertions are completely wrong.
sabres,lxszokq,2024-11-18 14:34:09,Do you have any recent examples of the pathway you are mentioning?
sabres,lxs76ad,2024-11-18 12:11:22,and Kahkonen was available very shortly right before Reimer became available but we missed out on that... Campbell would be a much better option even in JUST the hockey sense.*edited for spelling
sabres,lxsd3ex,2024-11-18 12:41:02,this is the way
sabres,lxs9alk,2024-11-18 12:22:02,I peep that ETID username 
sabres,lxsbjul,2024-11-18 12:33:20,I would hope not. Whatever veteran backup (whether that be Reimer or someone else) we have should be trusted enough to do that otherwise what's the point of a backup? That would just be repeating the 3 goalie rotation of last season basically.Tinkering with him by calling him and sending him back might only set him back again. Let him cook down in the AHL for awhile.
sabres,lxs4du4,2024-11-18 11:57:07,He has not gotten a proper development in the way that other players get. He went straight from college to the NHL and has been jostled around between the AHL and NHL ever since.He needs time actually developing not playing above his current level as a backup NHLer (that barely plays) behind a team that also leaves him out to dry defensively.Blame GMKA.
sabres,lxs4t5c,2024-11-18 11:59:16,Ryan Miller played his first NHL game at 22 and didn’t have a regular gig until 25
sabres,lxs4dcq,2024-11-18 11:57:03,He’s a goalie not a winger.  They take years to develop usually.
sabres,lxsie4l,2024-11-18 13:07:31,Goalies take the longest to develop. Hasek was 28 when he became a full time starter
sabres,lxs6r8e,2024-11-18 12:09:13,Buddy the male brain isn't even fully developed until almost 30.
sabres,lxsbo4i,2024-11-18 12:33:56,>he’s 22.Yeah and? He's 22. That's remarkably young to be an NHL goaltender.
sabres,lxskqa4,2024-11-18 13:19:20,Yes but we didn’t need to make a move with Samuelsson and Thompson on IR. Hopefully Thompson is back Wednesday.
sabres,lxsi63v,2024-11-18 13:06:23,I'm talking about last year as I said. They screwed him up last year with the 3 goalie fiasco...
sabres,lxt3iu1,2024-11-18 14:53:35,A fast and dirty rundown of some Vezina winners:* Tim Thomas - Full time NHL debut at age **31** after a bunch of time in Europe.* Henrik Lundqvist - Full time NHL debut at age 23 after playing 5 years in the SEL* Sergei Bobrovsky - Full time NHL debut at age 22 after 3 years in the KHL* Tuuka Rask - Split time with Tim Thomas at age 22. 2 years in the AHL.* Carey Price - Full time NHL debut at age 21 after 2 years in the AHL.And it goes on like this. The trend seems to be 2-ish years in the AHL from age 21-23ish. There's exceptions to be sure. But there's no getting around those 100+ games in the AHL.Levi on the other hand was rushed into a Sabres Jersey. He played in Buffalo before he ever played in Rochester. And now 2 years into his contract he has only 26 games in the AHL.
sabres,lxt2zil,2024-11-18 14:50:52,Hellebuyck - season and a half Oettinger - half a season Kochetkov - half a season Saros - half a season Gustavsson - season and a half Markstrom - bout two seasons spread out over 5 yearsThere's guys like Binnington and Hill that did a decent chunk of time in the AHL but it's just not a good goalie development league. I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons russian and euro goalies are so dominant and canada's goalie pipeline has dried up so much.
sabres,lxt32ps,2024-11-18 14:51:19,I agree. I was hopeful for a Kahkonen upgrade when he became available. Campbell would also be great he's an A+ person from reports around the league. But KA picked Reimer in the offseason so he's probably biased about the opportunity to get his guy back.
sabres,lxsw1wb,2024-11-18 14:15:57,Buffalo's finest. Besides the Sabres of course. Glad I got to see them before they split up.
sabres,lxsbw5u,2024-11-18 12:35:03,Not to mention he went from essentially two leagues below the CHL straight to the NCAA. He was *awesome* in the NCAA but there's a lot of younger development he didn't have before he went to college.I absolutely don't blame KA for trying to catch lightning in a bottle especially with his performance two years ago for us down the stretch. In fact I commend him for giving Levi a chance and knowing when just send him back down
sabres,lxsiw5v,2024-11-18 13:10:03,24-25 yrs old is when the brain stops developing. 30 would be for someone who's mentally challenged.
sabres,lxsjbsd,2024-11-18 13:12:16,And then he went down to Rochester and had the best season a 21 year old goaltender ever had in the AHL and was the best goalie in terms of statistics in the AHL. If that's fucking up his development then please fuck up his development some more.
sabres,lxthlrm,2024-11-18 16:05:01,Yep.. Even Hasek and Miller.  (Hasek spent less time in the A but was getting seasoned in Czechoslovakia.)  The Brodeurs and Prices of this world are very few and far between.
sabres,lxtgsg6,2024-11-18 16:00:54,Hellebuyck - he played in 58 games his first year as a pro. He was then the team’s starter for over two months as he started 10 games in December and then 11 games in January. He was eventually sent back to the AHL to resume as a starter not a backup. In 16-17 the crease was his and he started 56 games. Oettinger - in 20-21 he played in more than half the games (slightly). But also keep in mind that there wasn’t much of an AHL season and the weird rules that existed during that season. He then started the next year in a normal AHL before being handed the starters job. Kochetkov - he started a combined 50 games in 22-23. Also take note that his development has seemed to stall considerably. Saros - this is a decent example however…do you know who he was playing under? He also had completed 3 seasons as a full-time starter. …I’ll take a look at the others but rarely is a goalie developed the way that Levi has been and it’s for a reason. Goalies take time and they need starts.
sabres,lxsl63n,2024-11-18 13:21:31,They only did that when season was a  lost cause and he wasn't playing great.  He wasn't ready to start last season the way they threw him in 5 games straight... for a team desperate for playoffs they sure as hell made rookie moves. That and no vet signings last year. So yeah... they fucked that up. Pretty much saying what everyone thinks.
sabres,lxsnydv,2024-11-18 13:35:28,>They only did that when season was a lost cause and he wasn't playing great.That would have been a week from now last year. He went down on the 28th of November. Not February.I don't really understand what you're trying to argue by saying the Sabres are ruining his development by seeing what the arguably the best goalie prospect in the world can do at the NHL level early in the season and if he needs more time in Rochester they pull that trigger.They did that last year and he was *awesome*. 21 year olds don't go 16-6-4 and have a 0.927% in the AHL.22 year old goalies rarely find starting jobs in the NHL. But all 32 teams try out their young goalies from time to time because they can. They can call them up and send them down for free. Giving a sniff of the NHL regardless of performance is the carrot on the stick.
sabres,lxtdasu,2024-11-18 15:43:27,Find me an above average goalie that was developed in this manner.
sabres,lxss1i6,2024-11-18 13:55:53,">""That would have been a week from now last year. He went down on the 28th of November. Not February.I don't really understand what you're trying to argue by saying ...""He went down 28th of November?  Not for long... He played most of his games in december and also played in january and march. Then finished in AHL.      Not a very good argument"
sabres,lxtdq8v,2024-11-18 15:45:36,Find me one who hasn't. Because young goalies always go up and down. I don't exactly have the time to go through the last 20 years of 32 team's worth of goalies who had games in the NHL for a bit and then played in the AHL at 21 years old.
sabres,lxsyykv,2024-11-18 14:30:31,So you're just whining for the sake of whining and have no actual argument. You just want to scream into the void that Adams sucks and that's all.
sabres,lxtr790,2024-11-18 16:53:26,I’ll tell you practically every top flight goalie was always a starter. There’s a couple exceptions (ie Saros) but in those cases it was due to being behind a legendary starter.
sabres,lxt4dib,2024-11-18 14:57:55,I guess so. Like a lot of others here. You keep stroking Adam's goat if you want. He is flip flopping on what to do with Levi.  Probably took Ruff to tell him he shouldn't be here especially how the rest of the team is.  It's posted everywhere that Ryan Miller didn't even get the Levi treatment.... you saying he is better than Miller?  You keep it up Mr. Levi fan club
sabres,lxt4s1u,2024-11-18 14:59:54,Holy crap you're dumb.
sabres,lxru47n,2024-11-18 11:04:09,I believe the PWHL is expanding to two cities next season. I wouldn’t be surprised if this is a “test” for the market to see if a Buffalo team could be supported. Obviously we could seeing as we had the Beauts for several years in the NWHL.
sabres,lxrvbio,2024-11-18 11:10:32,Glad it’ll be in KBC not HarborCenter but I hope they sell enough tickets!
sabres,lxrwnqc,2024-11-18 11:17:33,Really excited hopefully they get the ticket sales and fan enthusiasm to show that buffalo can support a PWHL expansion franchise!
sabres,lxs0doh,2024-11-18 11:36:50,Looking forward to this!
sabres,lxs2mkl,2024-11-18 11:48:14,Why weren’t the Beauts included in the initial teams for the PWHL?
sabres,lxrrxqh,2024-11-18 10:52:35,[Sabres Twitter Post](https://x.com/buffalosabres/status/1858533571289309228?s=46&t=1NdIkAa_KR0mt2iK0n-ElQ)
sabres,lxs0gw9,2024-11-18 11:37:18,I'm a former Beauts season ticket holder so I'm excited about the idea but the PWHL should have honored the Beauts' following and kept a team here after the PHF (formerly NWHL) folded.
sabres,lxrwpp7,2024-11-18 11:17:51,I was thinking this exact thing. Hopefully that’s good news. Do we see Pegula supporting another Pro women’s team or would there need to be different owners?
sabres,lxt1oef,2024-11-18 14:44:15,PWHL is on a completely other level than the NWHL in terms of attendance professionalism and exposure. If the normal NWHL crowd comes to that exhibition game Buffalo will be waiting awhile. Detroit pulled out 13K for an exhibition last year. They're high on the expansion list. Buffalo basically needs a Sabres game attendance level to make the cut.
sabres,lxsamyj,2024-11-18 12:28:45,Can’t exactly fault a new league looking at getting financially stable for taking those six markets over us. They are already adding two teams next year I don’t think it’s gonna be a much longer wait
sabres,lxt4bup,2024-11-18 14:57:40,The PWHL has its faults. Selecting markets and building fanbases is not one of them. They've finally created a league where women may be able to train and play full time instead of a league where everyone works full time M-F and gets basically a $5K stipend to play on the weekends.For many years women's hockey attracted less than a thousand people a match. The PWHL came in and set record after record in attendance and viewership. They have blown every previous league out of the water. They average over 5000 a game across all markets which was suppressed by Toronto playing in an arena that held a quarter of what they needed for most of the year. Put it simply going forward the league has four good markets that can probably draw around 8000 people every single game. That used to be the world record for attendance. They have a problem in NYC and Boston that may be rectified by new arenas but we'll see.Detroit got 13K people out to an exhibition last year in their audition for an expansion team.The bar is high and Buffalo will have to come with a lot more than former Beauts fans to make the cut.
sabres,lxsmmbt,2024-11-18 13:28:45,I believe for now the PWHL is a single owner league so the Pegulas wouldn't need to be involved outside of renting out the arena space.
sabres,lxsaqik,2024-11-18 12:29:16,Please different owners we need winning hockey back. Or at least Pegulas not a major owner that gets to make the big decisions. Simply rent out the venue to PWHL Buffalo
sabres,lxsbhaw,2024-11-18 12:32:59,I don't remember Minnesota having a NWHL team that sold out a ton of games but whatever they went the way they went.
sabres,lxos09i,2024-11-17 20:37:13,Good for him. Sounds like he’s playing on a line with Necas who has been going nuclear.
sabres,lxovfii,2024-11-17 20:58:15,Nobody ever said he wasn't a hard worker and brindamour can get a lot outta tweeners that are willing to grind
sabres,lxoupct,2024-11-17 20:53:46,There are hundreds of players that have had spurts like this just to fizzle into nothing. Do it over 2-3 seasons and I'll be impressed. 
sabres,lxorfty,2024-11-17 20:33:44,Jost too
sabres,lxot2y5,2024-11-17 20:43:50,Atta guy. First few games when he was picked up he played well
sabres,lxp092w,2024-11-17 21:28:08,Remember when Buffalo was rumored to be into Necas and Buffalo writers all broke down why he was overrated and Sabres Reddit didn’t want to trade any prospects for a guy like that and he said “lol I’m not going there anyways”
sabres,lxqt14b,2024-11-18 07:07:08,Remember he was basically traded to Buffalo for a roll of tape? Hope he does well in Carolina.
sabres,lxsrg7v,2024-11-18 13:52:57,Sabres fan with season tickets to the canes here (i like hockey and live in Raleigh). He's looked pretty solid but he's also the forecheck/energy/front-of-net guy on that line. I think the point production he's been getting is inflated because of guys like Necas/Jarvis. I don't think we'd rather have him in over the players we want to give NHL time to.
sabres,lxs4hl3,2024-11-18 11:57:38,Remember when we treated his arrival with a big shrug liked him for what he brought but also shit on Adams for not making a bigger move?
sabres,lxoxgzd,2024-11-17 21:10:54,Wait. Are you saying coaching makes a difference? Who would’ve thunk?!
sabres,lxrkeqe,2024-11-18 10:11:31,There's this kid? Luke Adam. I really think he's gonna be something.
sabres,lxspo89,2024-11-18 13:44:08,Roslovic is another.   Of course all the Canes fans are like giddy on koolaid.I'll wait. 2nd seaon is where its at. If these guys can help get them past the likes of Fl Ny and a resurgent Washington I'll eat crow. Until then Tlusky's tweaks are just that and yes Brind'Amour is the one coach you know who will demand and get commitment from all his players so no suprise tbh. Of course having a motivated Necas helps too. Necas' is finally showing better vision and finish imho.
sabres,lxoxb19,2024-11-17 21:09:52,I think the point is that Adams traded a 2nd rounder for a guy who is significantly worse than a guy he let walk for free.
sabres,lxower4,2024-11-17 21:04:19,There are very few teams that have losing spurts like this just to rally into a playoff spot. Now don’t make the playoffs for 13 years and you’ll be the Buffalo Sabres.
sabres,lxp8p7m,2024-11-17 22:21:35,Jost has 1 goal in 4 GP with them (and a +1 rating)
sabres,lxskcfs,2024-11-18 13:17:24,Jost was great for us for like first \~20 games and then fell off a cliff
sabres,lxpwtfh,2024-11-18 01:29:04,I’m pretty sure it came out that there was no way Necas was coming to buffalo. Wasn’t going to happen no matter what Carolina didn’t really want to part with him *and* he didn’t want to come here.
sabres,lxp3b00,2024-11-17 21:47:02,Has anyone here ever argued that coaching didn’t make a difference? I don’t understand your point.
sabres,lxoxnrq,2024-11-17 21:12:06,Malenstyn and Robinson aren't the same kind of player.
sabres,lxowjy8,2024-11-17 21:05:12,I think pineapple on pizza should be made illegal. 
sabres,lxoy4hv,2024-11-17 21:14:58,4th liners who are fast. Yea they are.
sabres,lxp443m,2024-11-17 21:52:02,Haven’t you said before that they’re the same guy without any real difference?
sabres,lxpbhnf,2024-11-17 22:40:17,Yea. I’m responding to a guy who said “Malenstyn and Robinson aren’t the same kind of player.”

sabres,lxn007e,2024-11-17 14:36:07,Okay who’s gonna make the “Zachary Benson Has” #10 custom jersey
sabres,lxlxy85,2024-11-17 11:10:27,It’s not a bad take .I’d like to see him with a more stay at home defenseman. With the offensive skills he needs the right supporting cast. His role is what it is.
sabres,lxlzcib,2024-11-17 11:18:15,He took a boneheaded penalty to kill a power play.Two. He negated two powerplays.
sabres,lxlzwyy,2024-11-17 11:21:24,That first goal he was literally taking on 3 Flyers while the rest of the team stood and watched. Dahlin has flaws and a lot of that comes from him doing too much. He’s clearly the best defensive player on the team and the Captain. He’s trying to lead by example and when the rest of the team is giving up he’s making mistakes. This isn’t uncommon of quality players on bad teams. I hate the keep banging on the same drum but this team lacks quality veterans that know how to win games. Forget the Cup this team needs to learn how to win night in and night out.
sabres,lxlziwu,2024-11-17 11:19:14,I’m not worried about Dahlin. He’s not playing his best but he’s a top talent and a stud. He will get through it.
sabres,lxlzqfg,2024-11-17 11:20:24,He’s just trying to do too much after the contract and the C. He’s young as hell for how good he is and he’s only getting better for the next 3-5 years. Chill out people.
sabres,lxlzd7i,2024-11-17 11:18:21,Two of his penalties last night were because he stopped moving his feet.
sabres,lxonjam,2024-11-17 20:09:51,Dahls is simply trying to do too much.  He's in a new system and has to lead by example.  He's tired of losing and attempting to bring spark to the team.Don't worry. Be happy.
sabres,lxlyyyd,2024-11-17 11:16:09,I think he's getting very frustrated and needs a better D partner.Definitely takes bad penalties but I prefer that to playing soft like Power.Overall the team has just either been great or sucked with little in-between. The only player i am deeply concerned by is Quinn.
sabres,lxm7shn,2024-11-17 12:04:41,“Blame the good players”Time is a flat circle
sabres,lxm4v7d,2024-11-17 11:48:32,Damn we really already at the pushing our star player out of town phase already.
sabres,lxm3y33,2024-11-17 11:43:29,Our defenders are all good hockey players but for the most part they are not very good at defense (Byram does OK)
sabres,lxlxktd,2024-11-17 11:08:26,He got hurt in the first practice and is clearly playing through something.
sabres,lxmu3we,2024-11-17 14:04:59,Were really calling out dahlin... the entire team played like shit yesterday.
sabres,lxnl0tc,2024-11-17 16:29:05,These are valid criticisms but overall I think Dahlin is an elite talent that has played on some very bad Sabres teams. The edge he plays with will be a big advantage come playoff time when you can get away with a little more.
sabres,lxnytdt,2024-11-17 17:45:33,Yeah I'm starting to feel strongly that at this point of his career he's not a Hedman type (someone who does everything great so you just put whatever cheap player next to him) but instead a Bouchard type that needs to be paired up with a strong defender to cover for the defensive mistakes he'll make. Which this team doesn't have.
sabres,lxm63nc,2024-11-17 11:55:21,You don’t need to be on the ledge at all. You’re right to complain about Dahlin as he’s definitely having a down year so far but it’s not that bad. He’s worth every penny. We took a bad loss last night but the team is playing great MOST nights. They’re very much in the race for a top 3 spot in the division and if they keep it up get healthy and even improve a bit they’re gonna get a spot. If you wanna complain about any player pick Levi. He plays great in the minors but gets in his own head whenever called to NHL action. He gets caught out of position more than any goalie I’ve seen in years. He needs to settle down
sabres,lxmusjx,2024-11-17 14:08:30,I also can't stand when he doesn't skate back hard after cleared pucks.  He does this consistently.  I can recall a few times where he has got caught and I created a goal against or a quality scoring chance.He is certainly elite at times but man does he cause issues at times with lacking attention to detail and of course the horrible penalties.
sabres,lxno4lz,2024-11-17 16:46:06,I get the blame but I am not worried about him going forward. He needs to settle down but you cant do it on losing team.
sabres,lxrulod,2024-11-18 11:06:44,he took two boneheaded penalties to negate two power plays. he’s got talent but needs to learn to keep his head in the game and learn not to make poor decisions on the ice
sabres,lxtf7gp,2024-11-18 15:52:58,No. Thanks for asking.
sabres,lxmflcu,2024-11-17 12:48:04,Nope
sabres,lxm5d55,2024-11-17 11:51:17,He was fine last year as a $6m guy but now he's the 2nd highest paid defensemen in the NHL and at this point he's either the 3rd or 4th best defenseman *from his draft class*.He was clearly paid to take a step forward and be a cornerstone 1D and he has clearly not taken that step.
sabres,lxooxc3,2024-11-17 20:18:20,Easy things to fix but yeah painful watching it in real time. Much harder to fix talent
sabres,lxpbvkk,2024-11-17 22:42:51,I feel like he’s been playing this season like he doesn’t give a shit
sabres,lxrfkc7,2024-11-18 09:43:29,This team is endlessly frustrating. Every time I think they take a step forward I want to eat my words a week later.
sabres,lxro0gi,2024-11-18 10:31:29,We really can't be at the place where we talking about Star players like this. Not star caliber but current star players.
sabres,lxm5z1t,2024-11-17 11:54:39,Maybe Krebs said something personal to him?
sabres,lxma845,2024-11-17 12:18:15,I don’t know what he’s like in the locker room but in public he just doesn’t seem like a “captain” guy.  He was very quiet and emotionless for years and now all of a sudden he’s a hot head taking stupid penalties.Tuch is more of a captain even Greenway after watching him for a bit.
sabres,lxnfvwf,2024-11-17 16:01:21,Sometimes he’s really good most of the time he’s meh
sabres,lxm7cb8,2024-11-17 12:02:13,What you’re seeing is correct. He’s consistently out of position in the defensive zone he refuses to tie players up in front of the net. Constantly looks lost out front. He was on the ice for 3 goals against the game prior to the flyers where those goals could borderline be considered his fault defensively. He looks lost in front of the net. Never breaks up passes across the slot or crease. I love the offensive zone play and ability to cycle the puck/score. But Jesus Christ man he’s a defenseman and needs to play some damn defense. He’s borderline an overpriced defensive forward that refuses to put his body on the line to block shots and tie up guys out front. His forecheck and back check are atrocious this year. He’s had enough time in the show to develop he got the contract. The dude needs to get his shit together. He’s the defensive center piece and needs to step up his game and earn that big contract he signed. That or this GM needs to hire a legitimate defensive player coach behind the bench because our goaltending has been suffering immensely from how god awful our defense has been.
sabres,lxm7d28,2024-11-17 12:02:21,Not time to panic yet we can’t really score well without Thompson we still didn’t get shutout and the team is still the youngest in the league. Adams doing nothing the year after we were one point away and finally being taken off no trade lists is the biggest issue. We don’t have enough veterans in the organization and it’s a problem that no one agrees to go to buffalo with all the no trade clauses on every contract
sabres,lxm8ozd,2024-11-17 12:09:42,He's arguably the best offensive talent in franchise history (Housley) but his hockey IQ in the dzone is downright dreadful.
sabres,lxlz5db,2024-11-17 11:17:09,Honestly my biggest gripe with Dahlin is how enamoured with his shot that he is. He takes soooooo many really bad shots that crush possessions. For a guy who can skate as well as he does and who is as shifty as he is it makes no sense for him to be constantly flinging pucks from the point. It’s gotten worse this year. I’ve been getting crushed on here for saying he’s not a legitimate top d-man but the reality is he needs a borderline elite partner to allow him to be successful.
sabres,lxlz1qb,2024-11-17 11:16:35,I believe he is still learning to balance his game
sabres,lxm1h7g,2024-11-17 11:29:57,As talented as he is I wonder if he'll ever really live up to his draft status and salary.
sabres,lxmi2my,2024-11-17 13:01:41,Every year. There's something about this team that's not supposed to happen and it happens so I'm sick of it year after year after year after year after year.... you get it. Done.
sabres,lxn8wqp,2024-11-17 15:24:37,Last night was not Dahlin's fault. He is not a player who uses his body often and relies more on skill and hockey IQ. The team played super lazy last night and it's been a thing for a long time with this team. They go up then fall down they go up then fall down. At this point I don't know who to blame anymore for this team other than one family and it's the Pegulas.
sabres,lxp9ohc,2024-11-17 22:28:03,It’s a product of what’s around him surround him with good players and those mistakes will disappear.  Not the player to pick on at this point honestly.
sabres,lxlztfi,2024-11-17 11:20:52,Should’ve never been named Captain.
sabres,lxmd1vt,2024-11-17 12:33:58,Well he's Captain now. Trade him.
sabres,lxlxmxe,2024-11-17 11:08:45,He’s a fancy Ristolainen
sabres,lxm613m,2024-11-17 11:54:58,Sabres should have gotten two first line players. Instead they got Dahlin and Power and it’s a major factor in why they still suck.
sabres,lxmljlz,2024-11-17 13:20:22,That doesn’t excuse the bad penalties or the mistakes in the offensive zone
sabres,lxm4vva,2024-11-17 11:48:38,They were both fairly weak calls though. Refs seemed to really favor the Flyers last night. Our effort was poor regardless but it didn’t help.
sabres,lxm002a,2024-11-17 11:21:53,Thank you for the reminder!
sabres,lxm1pvi,2024-11-17 11:31:16,Agree. Dahlin is a plus 2 and is on the ice more than any other Sabres. He has to do it all and is bound to get tired and make a few mistakes but overall he is far from the reason we lose games. Now look at Quinn and Cousins who are a combined minus 13 they are killing us. A skilled veteran or two would turn this team around in a minute.
sabres,lxm0zoy,2024-11-17 11:27:17,“I hate the keep banging on the same drum but this team lacks quality veterans that know how to win games.”Truth.
sabres,lxmudjh,2024-11-17 14:06:22,They needed about 3 more Jason Zuckers and Adams once again didn’t do what he needed to. Only half measures in this organization.
sabres,lxm6x9v,2024-11-17 11:59:53,Yep. Couldn’t tell if it was being lazy or over-confidence in his stick skills either way sloppy. Looked like a high-schooler.
sabres,lxmjvxg,2024-11-17 13:11:30,I find that he seems more emotional on the ice this year and it might have to do with the C. Think if he can push a little bit of that imaginary weight off his shoulders he'd be fine. I just don't understand why the lines didn't get mixed up last game. They have been pretty consistently scoring in the first. They didn't find net through 2 periods and still kept the lines the same in the third. Almost like Ruff wanted to see what they could do without a goalie for 5 minutes.
sabres,lxm9ej0,2024-11-17 12:13:40,This is one good player that needs to do better. I do pin most of the overall blame on Adams for poor team construction. But Dahlin has been maddening to watch this season.
sabres,lxn3vfc,2024-11-17 14:57:19,Or maybe juuuuust maybe the players that went on to have success other places did so with a strong supporting cast and incredible veteran leadership. Maybe our perception of guys like Okposo were wrong from the start.
sabres,lxm62lx,2024-11-17 11:55:11,Bro for real. The terrible takes I read on reddit never fail to amaze me
sabres,lxm80wa,2024-11-17 12:05:59,Not at all. I want him here. I also want him to clean up his game. The two aren’t mutually exclusive.
sabres,lxngbns,2024-11-17 16:03:35,If only we could push him out I would have hope again for this franchise
sabres,lxmgc0v,2024-11-17 12:52:08,He wasn't hurt enough to go after Krebs in practice. This is an overblown.
sabres,lxlzd84,2024-11-17 11:18:22,This is such a cop out. He’s been this way since we drafted him 
sabres,lxm09s6,2024-11-17 11:23:23,Then he should simplify his game.
sabres,lxmvbiw,2024-11-17 14:11:15,He’s their captain their highest-paid player and a No. 1 overall draft pick. So yes.
sabres,lxo5zmp,2024-11-17 18:27:08,I like this take. Hope so.
sabres,lxnum2h,2024-11-17 17:21:49,"I agree with this Levi and Quinn are my biggest concerns or maybe I should say disappointments. i thought they were going to take the next step but they clearly need more time. Quinn is at least coming off of injury and is nowhere near himself. For Levi ""out of position"" says it all. He's not calm in the net. I know he's not big but if he just calmed down a little he wouldn't give up so much net"
sabres,lxngpyt,2024-11-17 16:05:39,Whoa there you can’t be that spot on about Reddit’s golden child. All winning is attributed to him and all losing is to blame of everyone else.
sabres,lxmcc4t,2024-11-17 12:30:00,Outside of Hughes who do you have above him?
sabres,lxmicg4,2024-11-17 13:03:10,Where have I heard ' no time to panic yet'?Oh yeah every year before the twenty game mark. Then more excuses come and nothing happens
sabres,lxmnphv,2024-11-17 13:31:50,That’s exactly what a d-man needs to do. It’s the forwards job to get net front to be there for screening puck redirecting and rebounding.
sabres,lxp7gs3,2024-11-17 22:13:34,Who has his best partner been? It’s not like he’s had anyone that’s actually good as his d partner other than power. He’s had to carry a lot of bad guys rather than play with good ones. I don’t think he an elite guy per say but someone who can cover for him and not be a sieve out there
sabres,lxm0kfy,2024-11-17 11:24:58,It’s like watching early 90s hockey sometimes.
sabres,lxmh8yc,2024-11-17 12:57:10,Do you think there might be some well meaning but misguided/youthful element of “I’m the captain gotta do it myself” going on with that? Especially since he’s doing that more and not less?
sabres,lxm0g2g,2024-11-17 11:24:19,He’s coming up on his 500th NHL game. Better learn quick.
sabres,lxo65rg,2024-11-17 18:28:09,My point is that his IQ is pretty damn low.
sabres,lxmkga8,2024-11-17 13:14:35,I’d laugh but…..
sabres,lxlzk3s,2024-11-17 11:19:26,Hot take lol
sabres,lxlzudo,2024-11-17 11:21:01,LOL.
sabres,lxlz9i0,2024-11-17 11:17:48,Having Risto around him for so long in his 1st 3 years probably did do some damage. He looked up to Risto.
sabres,lxmas4g,2024-11-17 12:21:23,Two drought era forwards drafted by the sabres are currently in the top four of NHL scoring 
sabres,lxmj105,2024-11-17 13:06:53,Well... we were supposed to have two elite forwards leading this team by now in Reinhart and Eichel. Reinhart trade was stupid.  Seeing how we throw 7M and 8M now at players that haven't earned it Reinhart should've been signed at 9M years ago.  Dumbfounded cause he's worth 11M now in smaller markets.
sabres,lxm8sso,2024-11-17 12:10:16,I wouldn’t mind Matty Beniers or Mason McTavish. I’m not writing Power off yet though.
sabres,lxnfjly,2024-11-17 15:59:42,Or in his defensive zone
sabres,lxm5h3d,2024-11-17 11:51:54,Those were both 100% penalties. The first one would have been a 2-0 if he didnt interfere. The 2nd was textbook slashing.
sabres,lxmlmmg,2024-11-17 13:20:48,Doesn’t matter still penalties
sabres,lxm362k,2024-11-17 11:39:14,Tuch and Power are also players that are killing this team. Power especially. I’m not sure what his game is anymore. Is he supposed to be a big bodied physical presence in front of the net? Is he a distributor from the point? Is he supposed to pinch in and be an offensive threat? What exactly is his role? He doesn’t seem to do anything well and looks like he’s lost every shift. Alex Tuch and this is my own dislike of him is the worst example of overhyped player. Fans love him because he’s “local” or whatever but he’s just not the quality player that everyone seems to think he is. His offensive game has just not been what it was hyped to be. He’s not gritty which is what he was also sold as. He’s not a playmaker that can draw attention away from the center of the ice to open up anyone else. And he’s not a presence in front of the net. So we’ve got Quinn Cozens Tuch and Power LITERALLY THE CORE OF THIS TEAM that are all overvalued and underperforming. You can’t win like that in any sport at any level.
sabres,lxm5q6d,2024-11-17 11:53:17,It’s why Zucker stands out. And McLeod. They know how to win
sabres,lxnla5i,2024-11-17 16:30:30,You’re completely right! Replace Krebs with Bryan Rust and Jokiharju with Adam Larsson which is not too far fetched and we’re a 100 point team. I promise!
sabres,lxndyhf,2024-11-17 15:51:32,Yea this was my issue at well I also was confused why ruff wouldn’t just mix the top 6 up a bit atleast
sabres,lxn85lw,2024-11-17 15:20:37,Stanley Cup champion Kyle Okposo?
sabres,lxm845s,2024-11-17 12:06:29,You enjoy watching him take bad penalties?
sabres,lxlzodz,2024-11-17 11:20:05,I very much disagree with this statement
sabres,lxmw8hg,2024-11-17 14:16:03,Ill address the fights comment... Who on the opposing team in their right mind would attempt to fight dahlin. Dahlin doesnt mess around hes the type if anyone touches him he nips it in the butt immediately he doesnt let it go. His mentality is rock solid.More concerning yesterday was the teams physicality as a whole. Not having greenway was a glaring issue. I believe clifton was the only one throwing hits.
sabres,lxnxox0,2024-11-17 17:39:05,According to The Athletic in the preseason tiering Dahlin was #1 D in the All-Star tier with 7 guys ahead of him in the two tiers above...MVP tier: Makar Fox HughesFranchise tier: Josi Heiskanen Bouchard McAvoyAll-Star tier: DAHLIN Hedman Dobson Forsling Morrissey Slavin Doughty Ekholm Theodore Toews WeegarLINK: [https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5750903/2024/09/24/nhl-best-players-list-2024-2025-season/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5750903/2024/09/24/nhl-best-players-list-2024-2025-season/)
sabres,lxngrkv,2024-11-17 16:05:54,Literally everyone
sabres,lxmf1zv,2024-11-17 12:45:06,Last year both Bouchard and Dobson did better in Norris voting (Hughes won ofc)
sabres,lxmk2v8,2024-11-17 13:12:34,About Dahlin. I’m pissed about roster construction
sabres,lxmtxrb,2024-11-17 14:04:06,Sorry not in the modern era. Watch Hughes or Makar. Guys are driving to the net with and without the puck now. Point shots should be used sparingly.
sabres,lxpc2b5,2024-11-17 22:44:07,This is fair. But when you are the highest paid player at your position you should be able to carry your line.
sabres,lxmu4hy,2024-11-17 14:05:04,He’s always taken a lot of shots from the point though. This isn’t new even though it’s seemingly gotten worse.
sabres,lxmx7xw,2024-11-17 14:21:13,And how many different coaches and systems?
sabres,lxmbp1e,2024-11-17 12:26:24,Not only this but a guy who was taken a few picks after him has evolved into arguably the league's best overall d-man. Hughes is not only elite offensively (much more than Dahlin) but he is among the top defensive d-men in the league. Dahlin IMO has fallen into the Bouchard Dobson range of very good but not elite d-men.
sabres,lxo2gdw,2024-11-17 18:06:24,I just said that since the comment I replied to specified giving Dahlin a stay at home so he can flourish more in the O zone
sabres,lxm5uh9,2024-11-17 11:53:57,The Flyer had just played the puck and Dahlin got a piece of him skating by. It’s what defenseman do every time a forward chips it into the zone. Usually it goes uncalled.
sabres,lxm5092,2024-11-17 11:49:19,Okay I have to take issue with this awful take. While Cozens and Power have been given contracts to lock them in as part of the core of the team Quinn and Tuch have not been signed long term. Quinn is having a down start to the year but we’ve all seen how good he is on offense and how hard he works in puck battles. Simply looks like he’s trying too hard to get out of the slump right now. He’ll find his way soon enough. Not the reason we’re losing at all. As for you trashing Tuch you’re outside of your god damn mind if you think Tuch isn’t the best two-way player on the ice. You’re obviously either not experienced enough watching hockey or you’re just not watching at all. Watch Tuch with or away from the puck and it’s instantly obvious that he’s UNDERvalued as an offensive piece even if you don’t take into account his shot which is underperforming this year and is still good. His playmaking ability is exactly what you want on the first line especially with shooters like Peterka and Tage with him. This sub is full of doomers every time the team takes a bad loss and hyper children whenever they win more than one game in a row. Learn some moderation and learn about hockey. Figger it out
sabres,lxm686m,2024-11-17 11:56:02,Tuch isn't a first-liner on most teams.
sabres,lxmdjq2,2024-11-17 12:36:42,This  they’re not even superstars but in this group they stand out. I'd add Malenstyn to that list too.
sabres,lxnsrbb,2024-11-17 17:11:32,Not an over reach on the level of players to acquire but 100 pts seems high from what we've seen so far. 92-95 seems right. But this seems sensible. Really doesn't belong in this sub /s
sabres,lxn8z9n,2024-11-17 15:25:00,Couldn’t have done it without him!
sabres,lxmk3ci,2024-11-17 13:12:38,Some of that is reputation. He's gotten a rep for taking penalties so he doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. Remember I think 2 years ago where he swiped at an airborne puck and missed but Max Domi pretended the stick hit his face fell to the ice and Dahls got a penalty? That's his rep. While Zachary Benson certainly has he's also getting a reputation like Dahlin's. I'm more upset about his game last night than Dahlin's. But it's one game. We'll see how this trip out west goes.
sabres,lxn06dm,2024-11-17 14:37:04,[deleted]
sabres,lxm0one,2024-11-17 11:25:36,Everyone should disagree with that statement.
sabres,lxmy6cy,2024-11-17 14:26:18,Dude he flat out got punched in the nose last season and just stood there. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want Dahlin or Thompson or any of our stars to fight. But his low check and fight with Krebs was poor judgement poor leadership and just plain dumb.
sabres,lxmowzq,2024-11-17 13:38:04,I know. It just seems this management cannot put together a simple winning formula with a supposed great decade of picks and every hire seems to reek of cheap or inexperience.... which hurts the formula on a grander scale.  These players are stuck in a losing culture and Pegula can't recognize this or care to fix.
sabres,lxp77x6,2024-11-17 22:11:57,Feels like an old school ruff thing encouraging that behaviour
sabres,lxmxqk1,2024-11-17 14:23:56,Too many.
sabres,lxmcsv4,2024-11-17 12:32:34,Usually it’s a normal breakout. For an odd man rush if you take the guy it gets called every time.
sabres,lxn0j2u,2024-11-17 14:39:01,He didnt get called for the first hit he got called for continuing to impede him along the boards after he chipped the puck past him.
sabres,lxpbm36,2024-11-17 22:41:07,I agree. Him taking the body right after the flyer chipped the puck off the boards is good defense that should not have been a penalty.
sabres,lxm6cbw,2024-11-17 11:56:39,Tuch is one of the best 2 way players in the NHL and his play has been consistent on every level. That dude is out of his mind if he's trashing Tuch. To that dude learn hockey.
sabres,lxmv919,2024-11-17 14:10:54,Tuch is absolutely exactly as you said.  Anyone who can't see that is blind
sabres,lxnhppi,2024-11-17 16:11:01,Literally out of his damn cranium if he thinks Tuch is “killing this team” Couldn’t read after that
sabres,lxm7avd,2024-11-17 12:01:59,First off I’ve been watching Hockey for over 40 years. Played it for a good portion of my youth and young adult life. I know the game as it’s been played across several eras. The personal attacks are unnecessary and unwarranted. I’ve watched just about every game this season and have seen nothing out of Tuch that leads me to believe he is playing up to his hype at all. Again as I stated in my post I don’t like him and I don’t think he’s the kind of player that he is made out to be by the fans. I’ve watched on several occasions this season where he gets outplayed and outmuscled looks lost with his stick in the air and late to get back on defense. I had hoped that he would have been a key player with Ruff coaching this team now. Unless things turnaround I don’t see it happening.
sabres,lxm7rxl,2024-11-17 12:04:36,He might be if he could hit the net.
sabres,lxm7k86,2024-11-17 12:03:25,This is correct.
sabres,lxnu7z6,2024-11-17 17:19:42,I really do think that if we were to acquire both today we would be a 100point team. Rust could take some steam off of Quinn and brings leadership and consistency. Larsson is a very good shutdown RHD exactly what we need. Right now it feels like we’re playing with one good d-pairing + 1 good offensive d-man. With Larsson we would at least have two good pairings whether he plays with Dahlin or Power. I think he can be a really good mentor for our young d-core.
sabres,lxn7u97,2024-11-17 15:18:56,If you only focus on the good you will never identify areas for improvement.
sabres,lxng5v8,2024-11-17 16:02:45,You’re providing level headed assessment and comments on a player simply not living up to an 11M contract or captaincy that’s simply not allowed here lol.
sabres,lxnk9md,2024-11-17 16:24:59,Culture changes don’t always work. Look at Nashville but also look at Washington
sabres,lxmkw01,2024-11-17 13:16:55,I don't have a stat but I see Tuch harassing players from behind streaking the puck from them etc. I don't know if he's one of the best 2 way players in the NHL but he is certainly the best on the Sabres. Those who don't see it are choosing not to because they don't like him.
sabres,lxm8mtz,2024-11-17 12:09:22,I love the “learn hockey” attack. It’s totally unnecessary. One of the best two way players in the NHL is purely opinion. Just like my take is purely opinion. When you and I watch him play we see different things. I don’t see a guy that gets every puck against the boards I don’t see a guy that hustles back on defense i don’t see a guy blocking shots working between the blue lines to cause turnovers. My entire point is that he’s not the player that he’s been made out to be he’s not the center piece player he was meant to be in the Eichel trade.
sabres,lxm83ih,2024-11-17 12:06:23,It’s incredible that you have so much experience with hockey and still don’t know what you’re looking at as every single thing you’ve said about Tuch is incorrect. You do know he’s number 89 right? If you were talking about Cozens I might agree but Tuch has been OVERperforming for the money he’s being paid. He makes less than Cozens right now… I’m also not personally attacking you; simply correcting you as you’re very very wrong on this take
sabres,lxnvnp5,2024-11-17 17:27:37,Here are two different looks:Peterka-Thompson-Tuch.Benson-Cozens-Rust.Zucker-McLeod-Quinn.Malenstyn-Lafferty-Greenway.Dahlin-Byram.Power-Larsson.Samuelsson-Clifton.UPL.Levi.Or:Peterka-Thompson-Rust.Zucker-McLeod-Tuch.Benson-Cozens-Quinn.Malenstyn-Lafferty-Greenway.Dahlin-Larsson.Power-Byram.Gilbert-Cilfton.UPL.Levi.
sabres,lxsb28r,2024-11-18 12:30:52,Fair enough
sabres,lxnlrpa,2024-11-17 16:33:08,1-2 years though with those teams.  And they were both successful in past decade.  We are talking 15 years almost.
sabres,lxp7356,2024-11-17 22:11:06,Nashville isn’t working because they signed over the hill vets (stamkos and Marchy) whereas Washington was getting guys entering their primes or in the their primes
sabres,lxppknf,2024-11-18 00:23:39,You need to get your eyes checked.
sabres,lxm8wjd,2024-11-17 12:10:53,Ahhhhh so it’s the money. If he was being paid more you’d have a different opinion of his play?
sabres,lxnyvfs,2024-11-17 17:45:52,"I see Rust is in the same Tier as Tuch in The Athletics ""Support"" Tier but don't you dare move Tuch down for him.  ;)  He'd have to earn that.https://preview.redd.it/rzdbe7vyij1e1.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=bedd3d5dbe2e6b610663ca8f343abb3eb13bb622"
sabres,lxqnspw,2024-11-18 06:19:10,And Nashville’s young guys aren’t doing anything
sabres,lxm9j7o,2024-11-17 12:14:22,No I’d have the same opinion. He’s one of the best 3 players on the team and that’s indisputable. If you wanna talk about money he’s criminally underpaid right now and we might not be able to afford him when his contract is up
sabres,lxnz1oh,2024-11-17 17:46:52,It’s more that I think Tuch and McLeod have played pretty good together.
sabres,lxmao17,2024-11-17 12:20:43,I guess we see different things. I don’t see him that way at all. Like I said I had hoped that he would turn into the player that fans say he is but I just don’t see it. You asked if I see the difference between him and Cozens and frankly I don’t. The production/chemistry with Thompson I think gets him some grace but if he leaves this team I don’t think we are better or worse at all. The way this team is constructed who is being paid a player that is arguably one of the best at what he does should be having a bigger impact. You shouldn’t be losing 5-2 with the best two player in the league. You shouldn’t be losing 7-5 to the worst team in hockey.
sabres,lxo11jj,2024-11-17 17:58:19,OK at least you see a chemistry there but Tage-Tuch has a longer history. Zucker and McLeod have been great acquisitions. I wouldn't object to seeing them with 89
sabres,lxmchdr,2024-11-17 12:30:49,You’re reacting to a loss. That’s all. And the reason we lost both of those games is because of a different player that you haven’t named in all of your comments. I’ll let you figure out who since you “see it differently”. You’re right you SHOULDN’T lose 7-5 to anyone. But if you score 5 goals and still lose who’s to blame? Definitely not Tuch who may not be a first line choice for every team but definitely is not a bad first line choice.
sabres,lxl92q7,2024-11-17 08:32:58,It’s both a blessing and a curse because it’s frustrating that the division has been this bad and yet we still can’t pull it together enough to pull away
sabres,lxlcssb,2024-11-17 09:00:04,Really no different than the last 20 seasons or so. Close but no cigar.
sabres,lxlnlpi,2024-11-17 10:10:38,Someone will pull through in the next little bit. We really need to add scoring and a bottom pair defenseman. I think Levi goes to Rochester
sabres,lxlup8f,2024-11-17 10:52:07,Can’t wait to do this all year as usual
sabres,lxll7wr,2024-11-17 09:56:11,"We have no second scoring line full stop.Currently we have two players on pace for 30+ goals and three on pace for 20+ and on the very low end of 20 I would add. That's not a playoff team. That's not even a team that finishes with 88 points.This meshes with preseason analysis of the team ""You need a top 6 forward because you dumped two scoring forwards where are the goals coming from???""If they don't bring that guy in by the end of the month and the team is still only hovering around .500 it's over. They'll be just entertaining enough to keep 8000 fans in the stands but that's it. No playoffs moving on to year 14."
sabres,lxmywra,2024-11-17 14:30:18,Need more folks like you in this sub instead of the overreacters and whiners. It’s hockey in the NHL. It ain’t easy it ain’t supposed to be and so far this year it’s been a lot of fun to watch. Cheers
sabres,lxu73vd,2024-11-18 18:19:50,Positivity!!!
sabres,lxlgm4y,2024-11-17 09:26:24,The truth won’t be known until March. We are a bubble team and will live on the bubble all season. Like we have of late. It’s frustrating but Jesus at least we aren’t buried like we used to be this time of year.
sabres,lxlx5pt,2024-11-17 11:06:06,If you are saying we are out you are dumb. But doesn’t change the fact that yesterdays game was awful
sabres,lxrnpic,2024-11-18 10:29:49,This is a .500 team.   Lose 1.  Win 1.   Lose 3.  Win 3.  Its so damn frustrating.  :(
sabres,lxlw1qs,2024-11-17 10:59:50,Also 2pts out is the Pittsburgh Penguins. Their GM is smart enough to already recognize the pulse of the team and take action. Our GM will probably add more 4th liners.
sabres,lxlvqjz,2024-11-17 10:58:04,Just need to stay at roughly .500 while they figure things out. Once they find that higher gear they can be a in a playoff spot
sabres,lxle882,2024-11-17 09:10:07,Omg. This forum is delusional.
sabres,lxlearx,2024-11-17 09:10:37,Yeah it's almost as if this team was constructed badly.
sabres,lxlsefq,2024-11-17 10:38:56,Generating offense as a whole is the least of our worries at this point. Playing better defense and having consistent goaltending is what's plaguing this team right now.
sabres,lxol5og,2024-11-17 19:55:24,I concur!
sabres,lxqz0t0,2024-11-18 07:54:59,"I'm as excited for the season as I was at the start. Although our team is far from perfect and there is plenty of work to do I think a lot of the ""fans"" have learned to cope with constant disappointment by pickling themselves in a victim mentality... Hence the overreacting and whining."
sabres,lxnasmv,2024-11-17 15:34:48,Thanks friend.   I can absolutely guarantee there will be some fun games ahead.   It's entertainment as you say.
sabres,lxlolem,2024-11-17 10:16:36,On this date in....2023 we were 3 points out. 2022 we were 6 points out.2021 we were 2 points out.2020 they weren't playing.2019 we were 1 point out.2018 we were actually IN.Maybe only one of those years seems like being buried.
sabres,lxmusfr,2024-11-17 14:08:29,We're not out. But we have like 10% chance to make it in. So much has to start going right. (And keep going wrong for other teams).
sabres,lxrth4i,2024-11-18 11:00:44,yep that's the pattern.    I just believe (hope?) that Lindy will break the pattern at some point -- if he has all the horses healthy
sabres,lxndhfz,2024-11-17 15:49:03,Yeah the decision he is making is to sell off assets because they ain’t making the playoffs. They have also played two more games so they are 3 games below 500 compared to our 1 and have 2 more loser points……
sabres,lxls0ek,2024-11-17 10:36:41,Hard to construct a team properly when we havnt had a solid coach. Our current coach is the guy fired from Jersey because he couldn’t adapt. And he is likely the best coach we have had since drafting dahlin…We cannot gauge what we have properly because they have played in a shit system consistently (Montour being the most egregious example)
sabres,lxma4wt,2024-11-17 12:17:46,"The core idea of the team isn't flawed the edges are just poorly executed. So IMO the team isn't constructed badly it's ""just"" incomplete. They're missing a veteran power forward (of which there were some in UFA that he should have gotten) and a top 4 defensive Dman (of which there were some in UFA that he should have gotten).I guess what I'm trying to say is it's not constructed Badly it's just constructed Poorly? Like it's not bad ideas it's bad execution around the perimeter."
sabres,lxlu23s,2024-11-17 10:48:26,Of their nine losses they've scored two or fewer in seven of them.  I don't disagree about goaltending and defense but those aren't personnel issues they're performance issues. Theoretically they have the personnel they're just not performing up to expectations. We have one of the highest defensive payrolls in the league and the whole point of rebuilding the bottom six from scratch which they overpaid to do was to to be better defensively. They even brought in Ruff a coach reputed for his ability to coax better defensive performance out of teams.By contrast they're largely expecting guys in their middle six who are not proven 20 and 30 goal scorers to be that. That's personnel. They don't have a body on the team that replaces the offensive upside lost by either Mitts or Skinner. It's not a matter of coaching or performance they don't have the body.
sabres,lxlvr78,2024-11-17 10:58:11,Generating offense is the biggest concern. The team has been getting by with puck luck and some shaky opposing goaltending. On a night when they don’t have luck they look doomed (like last night) and if they run into a string of goalies on their a-game it’s going to be tough sledding. I can’t put my finger on the exact problem whether it is a system issue (this is my current direction) or a talent problem but aside from Thompson there isn’t a single forward that is consistently a threat.
sabres,lxlqtqz,2024-11-17 10:29:47,Okay maybe it’s more like December that’s we would be cooked 22 was the first year the playoffs seemed reasonable by spring
sabres,lxndrbh,2024-11-17 15:50:29,If we play 95 point hockey from here on out we probably make it regardless of what others do. We simply need to play better.
sabres,lxneajt,2024-11-17 15:53:17,I mean it’s 10% with how it is right now if we start playing better it changes if others play worse it changes we still have most the season to go
sabres,lxlviol,2024-11-17 10:56:49,Whatever you say. Delusional
sabres,lxm2wlo,2024-11-17 11:37:47,It’s most definitely a talent problem in the forward group. There’s zero depth off the top line so when one of them goes out you have to bring up someone from the 3rd line to plug the gaps because the 2nd line is entirely useless and the 3rd line falls off when it isn’t Greenway McLeod Zucker. Cozens and Quinn kill any partner on their line because those two can’t get it together. The 4th line is allergic to the middle of the ice so even when they have extended time in the o-zone they rarely generate a shot on goal because all they do is skate it to the boards and play ping pong on the outside. Yes the job of a 4th line should be to grind your opponents out but I wish they’d pretend like they could come up with a dangerous offensive chance especially if Dahlins pairing is on the ice with them. Adam’s wasn’t able to secure a T6 FWD to replace Skinner and it’s coming back to haunt them. Of all the Sabres wins there has only been one game where they’ve won without a goal by Tage Thompson.
sabres,lxncuy4,2024-11-17 15:45:50,It’s difficult to assess because on paper we have the 12th best offense and 6th worst defense this season but in reality we have been scoring a lot of goals that advanced stats would say shouldn’t go in and at the same time have been allowing a lot of the same. Like we’ve been getting lucky with bad goaltending recently but for the most part our goaltending has been equally bad.
sabres,lxt0yqk,2024-11-18 14:40:39,Yes obviously if we start playing better and reevaluate later if we had more points from playing better then the odds improve. My 10% reference which is ballpark what the Athletic's model gives is also based on the likelihood we CAN start playing better and start closing that gap. It's not impossible but it's gonna be tough. So root for them and hope they succeed but temper your expectations.
sabres,lxmemy5,2024-11-17 12:42:46,Yea the team depth is miserable. I hated the adds that Adams made in the off-season as none of the guys are the types to generate offense. Additionally they were always an injury or under performance away from things completely falling off the rails.
sabres,lxu9bt1,2024-11-18 18:32:40,I mean I don’t have to temper expectations. We make it 100% :)
sabres,lxl4urs,2024-11-17 08:01:01,If he returns quickly and it’s not a nagging injury he could

sabres,lxja5qc,2024-11-16 21:49:10,Absolutely terrible game from the entire team I hope Ruff is pissed with them we could have had a chance to win to tonight
sabres,lxjcg00,2024-11-16 22:04:22,For 10+ years now regardless of coach/GM/personnel the Sabres lead the galaxy in aimless giveaways. They come in many forms like the blind pass to the other team off-target passes full-sighted passes to the other team lazy reversals and of course the cursed hail mary flip towards center ice. These can originate anywhere but most often come from deep in our own zone. When we avoid these plays we look like the other NHL teams. It's maddening watching so many games where the puck is treated so carelessly.I cant understand how or why this has been an issue for over a decade.Maybe this is just how I perceive our play in our own end vs the average team across the league. I'd love to see a chart of giveaways in the D zone for each team. We handed this game over tonight. Maybe we will eventually stop doing this? The games we've looked our best this year are when we have clean exits with possession. Please give us more of them.
sabres,lxje5zh,2024-11-16 22:15:56,Imagine dragging all your friends/family/mentors to Philly just to play like ass
sabres,lxja8hx,2024-11-16 21:49:41,Carried no momentum from Thursday night. Power looked brutal tonight
sabres,lxjbo3c,2024-11-16 21:59:12,I just don’t understand games like this. If you lose to a team where you played hard and they just make more plays than you fine whatever. But when you show absolutely no effort and coast around for almost the entire game that’s when it’s unacceptable. They showed no heart no hustle no motivation.  Yes the injuries suck but injuries Don’t affect your work ethic.
sabres,lxjalpb,2024-11-16 21:52:08,Injuries hurt.    Nice when Tage and UPL are back.
sabres,lxjat6o,2024-11-16 21:53:30,Pretty awful game overall. Start winning again on the road trip and it won’t be a big deal in the grand scheme of things.
sabres,lxjady0,2024-11-16 21:50:41,Prolly overreacting but sometimes I wonder if maybe I should’ve just stayed in the background not caring instead of jumping back on two years ago it’s just so frustrating from the fun that season was 
sabres,lxj9zcw,2024-11-16 21:47:58,Mike Tyson had more fight last night than we did and now Dennis Gilberts record gonna have that one awkward loss just like Tyson
sabres,lxjbw7f,2024-11-16 22:00:41,"3 high danger chances for. Over the last 12 games they have 7.16/60 which is last in the league and would make Krueger's Sabres look like a high flying offensive assault. This isn't just ""Oh Tage is hurt"" as this has been ongoing for a month. This is a big problem and something drastic needs to happen."
sabres,lxjaz3p,2024-11-16 21:54:34,If I’m being generous injuries showed. Greenway in addition to Tage and UPL was enough to put them over the edge. If I’m being realistic harder work from those that were dressed could have gotten a point out of that game when it was 2-0.
sabres,lxjazej,2024-11-16 21:54:38,Lack of talent to overcome the bad goals Tage pls and add
sabres,lxjke77,2024-11-16 22:58:25,At least Detroit Boston and Ottawa struggle as well nothing is lost yet.

sabres,lxjaqaq,2024-11-16 21:52:57,It would be best for everyone if Power sat exactly one game to gain some perspective. He's not right. He looks clueless in nearly every situation and scenario. One game unplug it plug it back in see if that works.

sabres,lxjvt4q,2024-11-17 00:27:03,I was out the whole night didn’t even watch one second.My thought was:“We lost 5-2”Incredible. No better evidence that this team is a waste of time.
sabres,lxjheyt,2024-11-16 22:38:01,I have nothing to say other than the stripes went out of there way to not call anything in our direction and when they did they found a way to almost immediately cancel our advantage.
sabres,lxjiz3f,2024-11-16 22:48:29,The hockey gods said no more. We definitely angered them

sabres,lxjdtzo,2024-11-16 22:13:45,He’s so frustratingWhen he’s on he’s so good. When he’s off he’s so bad.
sabres,lxk20hb,2024-11-17 01:19:51,And Greenway.
sabres,lxjdy46,2024-11-16 22:14:30,Completely agree but we both know it won't
sabres,lxjc6u0,2024-11-16 22:02:39,I'm Power's biggest defender but I agree it wouldn't hurt for him to take a game or two off.It also wouldn't hurt if Adams could do something about all the AHL partners he's been playing with the last two years.
sabres,lxje8e0,2024-11-16 22:16:22,Weird way of saying Dahlin. He was dog shit tonight and negated 2 power plays with dumb plays.
sabres,lxlyg0w,2024-11-17 11:13:12,
sabres,lxjm3md,2024-11-16 23:10:53,Best deals in the history of deals maybe ever
sabres,lxje2wg,2024-11-16 22:15:23,AGAIN oh sorry wrong movie
sabres,lxjp080,2024-11-16 23:32:51,Honestly this needs to be recognized. They have been getting significantly outchanced for the last month but Ruff hasn’t really cared. He seems content with the players chipping in garbage goals.
sabres,lxjfu0s,2024-11-16 22:27:04,I guess the end result is that he is bad.   If you’re not good you’re bad?
sabres,lxk1xq5,2024-11-17 01:19:09,And even when he's good he's not good at defense. That's my biggest frustration. It's like he just wants to be a forward not a d-man. Dahlin and Byram can bring the offense while being defensively responsible.
sabres,lxncqm0,2024-11-17 15:45:13,Nah stop with the excuses…first overall pick 6’6 defenseman that cannot or will not throw a check… the guy has no clue how to play defense but he insists on being deep on the other teams zone constantly…I believe you should prove you can play your position on defense before you can freelance on offense…just change him to forward if he’s goona prefer playing offense
sabres,lxjiutt,2024-11-16 22:47:42,Power spent a critical third period PP losing the puck twice and drop passing to nobody. That was one of his better shifts. He's capable of better and we need it.It's like a mix of indecision and lack of confidence pure poison.
sabres,lxjhe03,2024-11-16 22:37:50,He’s young and inconsistent. The talent is there; the ceiling is there. He needs to thread the needle & put it together consistently.He will most likely be softer than baby shit his entire career though.
sabres,lxk2g69,2024-11-17 01:23:48,Byram BTW has excellent stick work and gap control. He’s very very very good
sabres,lxk4mg7,2024-11-17 01:43:03,Byram isn't good defensively at all.
sabres,lxohd3v,2024-11-17 19:32:54,It’s funny that you have this opinion. I’ll be honest part of me agrees that learning to play defensively should be a player’s first priority. This is why I’m not on the “Krueger was a hockey terrorist” wagon. I think he was trying to teach players like Dahlin defensive responsibilities before unleashing them. However I think Power isn’t as bad as you are making him out to be. While he’s not a physical presence that’s not overly important if you are positionally sound like Dougie Hamilton.
sabres,lxk9hhb,2024-11-17 02:31:57,I'm with Craig Rivet when it comes to Power he's gonna have a long productive career in the NHL. His transition game is great for his age. I'd rather keep him and coach him/give him a partner to succeed than move him now before his prime.But yea he's still probably the only NHL player I can think of who I would not be afraid of if told I had to go retrieve a puck on the boards in front of him.
sabres,lxjiqdj,2024-11-16 22:46:52,I thought his shot was gonna be shit forever and he seemed to improve that. Maybe he can play a tougher game in the future... for a coach like Tocchet or someone like that
sabres,lxk2ng2,2024-11-17 01:25:30,I might be the biggest bosexual on this sub. You're preaching to the choir. I desperately want to see that man stick around in this city long term even if it's at the expense of moving OP.
sabres,lxpdezp,2024-11-17 22:53:25,Nothing “sound” about this kids game
sabres,lxkwgu7,2024-11-17 06:44:14,Having a partner for him to succeed is big. I don’t think the people on this sub realize exactly how shafted he has been throughout his career in terms of deployment. His top partner for his career has been Joker. Whatever your opinion of Joker is he’s currently skipped on the depth chart by Bryson and an AHLer. His next most common partner has been Dahlin and they always slay together. After that is Bryson and Sammy. Then Byram Clifton Clague Boosh EJ and RJ. So less than a quarter of his total ice time has been played with an actual NHL D-man. Outside of that he’s been stuck with 3rd pairs/AHL guys. It’s really tough to succeed under those circumstances. But this is in Adams for not being able to identify NHL talent.
sabres,lxjyw68,2024-11-17 00:52:13,He needs to just mature. I have full faith in OP.But we need the blue line to start to shine bc we have so much invested in it; and they just aren’t doing it consistently.
sabres,lxk2qyt,2024-11-17 01:26:20,Hes not going anywhere. You don’t move mitts right when he breaks out if he’s not in the plan
sabres,lxkvs7l,2024-11-17 06:37:09,What do you think the next contract looks like?
sabres,lxm9ri4,2024-11-17 12:15:41,Big. $8x6?
sabres,lxmfgl8,2024-11-17 12:47:21,I would think at least that. Friedman reported last night that the cap could reach $97m next year. A 10% cap hit doesn't seem completely unreasonable.
sabres,lxmfjlp,2024-11-17 12:47:49,Agreed
sabres,lxjd03y,2024-11-16 22:08:09,Get some sleep Lindy we know.

sabres,lxjisuz,2024-11-16 22:47:20,Perfect game plan! I believe it must be tapped in the room as it's the same plan for the last 13 f'ing years!
sabres,lxl4xgo,2024-11-17 08:01:37,that was the ugliest game we've seen this far this seasonjust seemed as though everyone was mentally somewhere else
sabres,lxke7xe,2024-11-17 03:22:58,We are on a 82 points pace wonderful!
sabres,lxl879d,2024-11-17 08:26:45,It's getting old.
sabres,lxjrvbj,2024-11-16 23:54:54,They're not going to win when they're convinced Dahlin is their best defenseman
sabres,lxlarry,2024-11-17 08:45:34,Now entering those teenage years...13+ and counting.
sabres,lxk5hjf,2024-11-17 01:51:24,Dahlin is a great defenseman but when everyone else is checked out even Victor Hedman would look like shit. Prime Nickolas Lidstrom couldn't win 2v20
sabres,lxlwqqb,2024-11-17 11:03:46,Just seems to me that most times there's a goal scored against us he's standing next to the guy who scored or trying to get back into the play. He's great on the offensive side but I think he's a liability in our end. But that gets overlooked because of his point production.
sabres,lxj9fv7,2024-11-16 21:44:23,Long-term yes. But that’s not the issue tonight. You can’t blame one game on ownership. Tonight’s issue was not showing up as a team in a game that could’ve been winnable. Ruff said after the last loss they’d rebound and not be a team that loses 2 in a row. They won the next game. Hopefully we carry the end of the game momentum into next week and do better 
sabres,lxjcd54,2024-11-16 22:03:51,Spending under the cap is simply unacceptable and the presumption should be that the team is underperforming simply off that alone
sabres,lxjyk2q,2024-11-17 00:49:28,Honestly what else can it be at this point? It’s a salary capped league and somehow we’re just one of the worst every year by random chance?
sabres,lxktxac,2024-11-17 06:17:15,Yes go buy the team and do it right. :)
sabres,lxr48z3,2024-11-18 08:31:47,Holy shit yes it is. They haven't made the playoffs since 2 months after Terry bought the team.
sabres,lxrte01,2024-11-18 11:00:16,Only one thing hasn't changed since 2011....
sabres,lxjkndf,2024-11-16 23:00:13,You mean the people that own the football team that is 600 million over budget for a place that won’t have a roof?
sabres,lxjnz0c,2024-11-16 23:24:53,Terry is lucky. Unlike us he doesn't remember the playoff drought.
sabres,lxjol82,2024-11-16 23:29:37,Anyone that voted no want these hands?
sabres,lxj9o3b,2024-11-16 21:45:55,I’m not saying just off of tonight’s game I’m just saying in general
sabres,lxkyarw,2024-11-17 07:02:39,Not only this but does Adams officially need his approval for every deal he makes? Like would Terry be able to call up Bettman and have a deal revoked if Adams made moves to spend to the cap?So while the internal cap is in place Adams seems perfectly fine with it. The trouble is going to be when Adams is interviewing for his next job the new owner isn’t going to care what restraints he had he’s going to care about the wins and losses. Adams could have easily outbid anyone for a guy like Matt Roy but instead he felt his team was better off with Joker Sammy and Clifton. That’s on him.
sabres,lxkq9wy,2024-11-17 05:37:23,It's wild that he has no issue spending over 300 million with the Bills and sinking a ton of his own money into a new stadium but can't spend up to the cap in the NHL...
sabres,lxjcumz,2024-11-16 22:07:07,I know just clarifying that while I voted yes it was specifically for long-term
sabres,lxr7nlt,2024-11-18 08:54:11,"he got a $1 billion dollars for the feetball stadium and the ""his own money"" is coming from expected increases in revenue from higher ticket prices higher game day prices and hundreds of millions from fans signing contracts to buy tickets forever.plus the feetball one plays 1/5 as many games to make 5/1 as many dollars in profit."
sabres,lxjat3o,2024-11-16 21:53:29,Every time they get close. Every time they make me think they're finally gonna get over the hump they lay an egg.
sabres,lxju5i1,2024-11-17 00:13:16,We lost because we haven't
sabres,lxj5xw1,2024-11-16 21:21:08,This sucks
sabres,lxk9ieq,2024-11-17 02:32:14,Gritty depantsed a Sabres “fan”. Of course we were going to lose
sabres,lxj6qgd,2024-11-16 21:26:26,Past 10 are pretty good.
sabres,lxj7j2l,2024-11-16 21:31:43,Panthers (1st meet) and rangers were fantastic. The rest? Smelly.
sabres,lxj7ou4,2024-11-16 21:32:45,6-4 
sabres,lxj40id,2024-11-16 21:08:27,I have a bad feeling if we make a trade it won’t be a big name and it won’t do anything to help the team I don’t know why but I’ve just got a really bad feeling
sabres,lxj3rbk,2024-11-16 21:06:45,I had the same exact thought though it looks like he has a NMC through this season so it'd have to be an offseason trade unless he waives it
sabres,lxj4ap4,2024-11-16 21:10:20,Yeah me too… I really want to get rid of Krebs. I feel like its so obvious to replace his place in the lineup with a more consistent and older player.
calgaryflames,lxu1fu9,2024-11-18 17:47:46,She's wrong for this but she's also so so right for this
calgaryflames,lxu4ow7,2024-11-18 18:05:54,Art
calgaryflames,lxtyjzr,2024-11-18 17:32:13,Haha I enjoy her as the singer more than George
calgaryflames,lxu190f,2024-11-18 17:46:44,So hungry right now
calgaryflames,lxu1arx,2024-11-18 17:47:00,She’s got a point
calgaryflames,lxu9p7r,2024-11-18 18:34:52,Omg 
calgaryflames,lxub2nv,2024-11-18 18:42:51,Quality content
calgaryflames,lxu4o3n,2024-11-18 18:05:46,I love them both we've got the best anthem team in the league
calgaryflames,lxu79fx,2024-11-18 18:20:43,She's gotten a lot better honestly. A couple years ago she was really pitchy
calgaryflames,lxsasbf,2024-11-18 12:29:30,I really hope he doesn't get traded
calgaryflames,lxsickr,2024-11-18 13:07:17,Love Ras but the fact our leading scorer has 11 points is *rough*. This team can't seem to score to save its life recently.
calgaryflames,lxsi14b,2024-11-18 13:05:41,Other fun facts he was ahead of tanev until recently (which our lighter schedule of late would account for)
calgaryflames,lxszpdl,2024-11-18 14:34:16,If they do decide to deal him before season’s end I can’t imagine dealing him for anything less than a 1st round pick blue chip prospect and solid NHLer under the age of 24. No Tanev/Hanifin type return where you’re acquiring under appreciated assets.Ras still has a year left on one of the best value contracts in the entire league. He’s a right hand shot D he just turned 28 can put up 40-50 points and play top pairing minutes while contributing to both the PP and PK. If they trade him it should be for a king’s ransom.
calgaryflames,lxtuimg,2024-11-18 17:10:36,The fact he leads the team with 11 points and hasnt gotten a point in the last *seven games* and no one’s caught up to him is pretty brutal tbh the fact we’re still in a playoff spot says a lot about our defense and goaltending 
calgaryflames,lxsc39z,2024-11-18 12:36:02,If he wants to sign I'd sign him. If he doesn't... You gotta flip him
calgaryflames,lxskzpa,2024-11-18 13:20:38,This team would be a lot lower in the standings if they didnt have a 2025 calder winner + 10 time future vezina winning goalie
calgaryflames,lxsx7i9,2024-11-18 14:21:44,Yep been that way since we lost tkachuk and gaudreau
calgaryflames,lxtismh,2024-11-18 16:11:00,It seems like a bunch of the guys have quiet first halves. Kadri and Sharky are great examples as last year everyone was like  with their production until December/January. I wouldn't be surprised if they unlock offensively by the end of next month
calgaryflames,lxsrl2u,2024-11-18 13:53:38,You're not wrong
calgaryflames,lxt879v,2024-11-18 15:17:32,Actually in team scoring we are not that different than the average team. The flames have scored 49 goals in 18 games. Edmonton has 50 goals in 18 games. Toronto has 58 in 19 games. Colorado at 61 in 18 games.Winnipeg has 74 in 18 games at #1 while Anaheim has 39 in 16.
calgaryflames,lxu5cts,2024-11-18 18:09:43,Apart from the past 2 seasons where our leading scorers were Toffoli and Kadri (with 73 and 75 points respectively) scoring has NOT been a strong point for us which sucks when we have a proven guy like Huberdeau
calgaryflames,lxu7b3n,2024-11-18 18:20:59,I would love that haul but I think you are over valuing him. Teams will use Honzek trade to Vancouver as a comparable. 1st and blue chip prospect or a solid NHLer under 24. I doubt we get both.
calgaryflames,lxt29hi,2024-11-18 14:47:13,I think this depends on what he wants to sign for. Ideally I'd try and sign him for a shorter deal than the max and if that means giving him more I'd do it
calgaryflames,lxsckbh,2024-11-18 12:38:24,I'd say flip. For a true center if possible (duh)
calgaryflames,lxt8xv7,2024-11-18 15:21:18,Also a certain to be “first ballot” HOFer!
calgaryflames,lxta2cj,2024-11-18 15:27:03,This is true but I think this is a bit inflated by us scoring 18 goals in our first three games lol
calgaryflames,lxsh0o5,2024-11-18 13:00:32,Ras for Bedard 1 for 1
calgaryflames,lxtntx9,2024-11-18 16:36:23,You are right they haven't been scoring as much since the first 5 games or so. I think they will figure it out and get more consistent.Some of it is to be expected we had a lot of turnover at both forwards and on defense. Some of the new guys are adjusting and some might not work out. Just part of the retool.
calgaryflames,lxrdzza,2024-11-18 09:34:01,He's the real deal. 
calgaryflames,lxs9d72,2024-11-18 12:22:24,This is what happens when you grind and stay humble congrats
calgaryflames,lxt2mdz,2024-11-18 14:49:02,I expect that this particular congratulations meant more than any other one which he recieved.
calgaryflames,lxpam6o,2024-11-17 22:34:20,I don't really see it as a problem. Wolf is still new to the league. Yea he looks great but might also be because they're splitting giving time to review previous games recover properly physically and mentally etc.
calgaryflames,lxpjlli,2024-11-17 23:37:33,Vladar is definitely playing better teams. Edmontonx2 Vancouverx2 Carolina Vegas NJ etc.Wolf is playing Utah Montreal. Pittsburgh Nashville Chicago etcTheir numbers are virtually the same. Vladar has literally let in 1 more goal than Wolf while playing far better competition.
calgaryflames,lxpaul2,2024-11-17 22:35:54,They’ve been doing the right thing so far imo. I also see Wolf getting the next start after his shutout and a few days off.
calgaryflames,lxpawqw,2024-11-17 22:36:18,I think it's more about continuing to be smart about Wolf's development. If this work load is so good for him like this why change and maybe it becomes too much too quick. I agree Wolf has the slight edge over Vladdy so far but both have still played well and I'm comfortable with either in net.
calgaryflames,lxpnacm,2024-11-18 00:05:04,Wolf shouldn’t be rushed. Guy nees to keep fighting for the starter job to the point where management has no choice but to give him the crown. I love Wolf but he’s young. Give him the reat of this season to prove himself and then next season we can talk about him taking on the starter role.
calgaryflames,lxpc9xi,2024-11-17 22:45:33,Huska is doing the right thing with keeping it close to 50/50 split. With how Cooley is playing in the AHL I wouldn’t be shocked to see us move Vladar at the deadline.It’s not like we need the cap relief from Dan’s contract but he’s a proven NHL goaltender and could fit well for a team in need of a solid backup that’s on the bubble for playoffs. We could get a good return from the right team.
calgaryflames,lxpifvr,2024-11-17 23:29:03,Honestly I think it's the perfect setup for Wolf's first year. He gets lots of starts and to be in rhythm but not immediately have to take on 55+ starts. Vladar is not playing badly per se the sample sizes are a bit too small to declare a clear starter yet.If these trends hold up consider mixing up the start share in the new year but I wouldn't target more than ~50 starts. Then next season he begins as starter.
calgaryflames,lxpwrmk,2024-11-18 01:28:36,Wolf is being put in positions to succeed. He’s getting the “easier” starts. And Vladar has been good this year too.I don’t have an issue with what they’re doing.
calgaryflames,lxpbjmx,2024-11-17 22:40:39,It’s not going to happen this year. Wolf will start the next game then Vladar the game after that. Unless Wolf pitches another shutout.
calgaryflames,lxpeaej,2024-11-17 22:59:30,I think it would be more honest to show the teams they've played was it a back to back. I think it would prove that he's getting sheltered starts like against the Predators. Which is the right thing to do in terms of developing your star goalie but it makes the other goalie look bad.
calgaryflames,lxpgkch,2024-11-17 23:15:40,He’s 23 lol. You need to develop goalies the right way and splitting 50/50 is very normal for rookie goalies
calgaryflames,lxpijqn,2024-11-17 23:29:51,No rush.  It’s Wolf’s first full year in the NHL no reason to start him too much.  I think by years end he will end up with somewhere better 40-50 starts which is probably the right number.
calgaryflames,lxpmp68,2024-11-18 00:00:26,I’m good with the 50/50. Can’t afford to rush Wolf’s development. He is arguably the most important player in the rebuild
calgaryflames,lxpdh5p,2024-11-17 22:53:50,What’s a normal good split these days anyway 50/32? It’s not too big of a deal. Don’t need him playing 60+ first year
calgaryflames,lxpi56l,2024-11-17 23:26:52,It has more to do with load management for a younger goalie rather than management trying to figure out who their man is. I think it gives both goalies a better track to their own success (Wolf developing into a franchise goalie and Vladar showing what he is with this injury behind him + maximizing trade value). 
calgaryflames,lxpcr7g,2024-11-17 22:48:51,They want to make vladar look good and possibly get a draft pick for him I’m assuming
calgaryflames,lxpxrjm,2024-11-18 01:38:17,Conroy is playing the long-game… how can you not see that? However yes if this becomes a real thing this year he’ll give the young boys a chance for *real* meaningful minutes but frankly it’s too soon to call on that and the reality is just stick with the plan because it’s working….. Veteran presence !
calgaryflames,lxr0cv8,2024-11-18 08:04:43,Split until the new year
calgaryflames,lxr6gja,2024-11-18 08:46:24,I would do it now. Wolf has earned the job
calgaryflames,lxs3fqw,2024-11-18 11:52:19,There is no we it's the flames organization and us as two separate entities.
calgaryflames,lxscygy,2024-11-18 12:40:21,Is Wolf really that much better leading to twice as many wins or is Vladar simply getting less goal support? What about quality of opponents? Their save percentage is so close all it would take is a bad bounce against Wolf in a low shot game to reverse things. Both are playing well why mess with it?
calgaryflames,lxtfg64,2024-11-18 15:54:10,It’s nice to have two solid netminders! Huh…netminders looks weird in text. Sounds normal when they say it on TV but reading it now it looks like a terrible portmanteau of network reminders (along the lines of ‘webinar’).
calgaryflames,lxtoe5i,2024-11-18 16:39:13,It's way too early to make such decisions. Dan Vladar is still ahead just by virtue of his experience and his ceiling is no less. That may change at some point. No one really knows having 3 potential options is a good thing for the franchise.
calgaryflames,lxphwei,2024-11-17 23:25:10,"My thought is if you have a ""backup"" goalie who can give you league average (or better) goaltending you want to split your starts pretty evenly. This may not be giving each goalie 41 starts but you probably don't want to give any goalie more than 50 starts. This is especially true right now. It doesn't really matter what the outcome of any game is. What really matters is Wolf's development. Let him show that he is too good for a 50-50 split of the starts for a couple seasons before you make him the true #1 goalie."
calgaryflames,lxpj01j,2024-11-17 23:33:12,Totally agree… next game do you start wolf though? Coming off a SO plenty of rest and playing well. IMO how could you not?
calgaryflames,lxpgpov,2024-11-17 23:16:43,This is the answer.
calgaryflames,lxpq44e,2024-11-18 00:28:13,Wouldn’t the same be said for vladar? And yet his stats are so much lower as OP mentioned
calgaryflames,lxqj55a,2024-11-18 05:30:40,This is essentially what I was going to say. Wolf is having success playing half the games. Would he have the same success playing 60%? 75%? Possibly not. Way better to give him half the starts this year learn the game get some confidence and get the team used to him. Next year give him two thirds of the starts and see if he can keep up the same level of play. If not return to the split and slowly ease him in. If he can then start transitioning him to starter. Best case he's full time starter in 3 years. If he needs more time keep in mind we're in a rebuild and don't really have a top 6 center anywhere in the pipeline right now let alone a legit 1C. We kinda WANT at least one really good draft pick.
calgaryflames,lxsros5,2024-11-18 13:54:08,I think it’s kind of a catch 22 I understand the splitting starts but at some point I feel Wolfie will get the reins this season.
calgaryflames,lxq8otf,2024-11-18 03:33:44,This is a good take.
calgaryflames,lxtcxwg,2024-11-18 15:41:39,"921sv% vs 905sv%. ""Virtually the same."" Also leaves out that the former has played Winnipeg (the best team in the league) Boston and Los Angeles.Both have been good this year but come on. No need to understate Wolf's early season accomplishments. One is having a bounceback yr as a backup the other is a potential star in the making."
calgaryflames,lxpb3z0,2024-11-17 22:37:40,Right and so that's my point. If he has another good game Tuesday do you keep riding him with no travel or back to backs the next 2 after? Or do you just auto swap back to vladar? We haven't had either goalie get 3 In a row yet.
calgaryflames,lxpd1gq,2024-11-17 22:50:49,I wouldn’t be shocked to see someone try and get Vladar sooner than the deadline. He is playing quite well it just that Wolf is playing very well.
calgaryflames,lxpk6el,2024-11-17 23:41:39,I think you have to start him. Let him build his confidence now coming out of that shutout and well rested.
calgaryflames,lxq2skj,2024-11-18 02:29:25,He will husk already set the precedent when vladdy got his shutout
calgaryflames,lxscz5u,2024-11-18 12:40:27,Unwritten rule that when you earn a shutout you get the next start
calgaryflames,lxphw5e,2024-11-17 23:25:06,I think they’re also upping vladdys trade value too imo… which I’m totally cool with being that cooley is playing so well with the wranglers. I hear Edmontons looking for a goalie lol…
calgaryflames,lxphhxs,2024-11-17 23:22:18,Depends what fans you ask? Theres lots on this sub that don’t want success this. My opinion as fans we can’t worry about mid round pic that’s for Conroy to navigate. As long as the team just keeps moving expiring contracts that don’t meet the 3-5 year retool and don’t sell the future. I’m happy with the direction this team is headed.Go Go
calgaryflames,lxpbgy8,2024-11-17 22:40:08,I want to see Wolf play both New York games as long as he looks good and then give Vladar the Wild. Anything after that depends on how those games go
calgaryflames,lxpifu0,2024-11-17 23:29:02,lol. And a D core that plays D
calgaryflames,lxqj7ue,2024-11-18 05:31:28,Lol and Colorado who probably have better depth players for us to try and grab. (Assuming all their main stars are off the table)
calgaryflames,lxpjnf2,2024-11-17 23:37:54,Why does everyone think Vladar has a ton of trade value? In order for him to even get a 3rd let alone better 2 things must be true:A save percentage 910 or higherA CONTENDER that NEEDS goaltending because of an injury. Seriously bros don't get your hopes up.
calgaryflames,lxsvl1v,2024-11-18 14:13:37,Wolf gets the wild because it's the next Gen game. Should have the goalie of the future in the game about the future. Wolf should play tomorrow and Saturday. Just from a marketing standpoint it makes more sense
calgaryflames,lxtn0tu,2024-11-18 16:32:16,Getting main stars for Vladar? I don’t think that’s possible.
calgaryflames,lxpvamf,2024-11-18 01:14:41,Vladar would be a serious upgrade for at least 3 teams right now as their primary let alone a backup.
calgaryflames,lxtvi8e,2024-11-18 17:15:51,For sure would be very very surprising if we did. May get some more depth/unrealized talent off other teams though
calgaryflames,lxpvrpz,2024-11-18 01:19:06,Okay which team and what are they giving up?How does it affect their cap? Are we taking a goalie back?
calgaryflames,lxq9d74,2024-11-18 03:41:25,Second this question - which three teams would want Vladar as a primary goalie?
calgaryflames,lxrzvtt,2024-11-18 11:34:20,If we take a goalie back we can waive him. I would be happy with a 3rd.
calgaryflames,lxr2sus,2024-11-18 08:21:58,Vladar is 24th in GSAA out of 75 goalies this year. He would be an immediate improvement for the Avs Flyers Blues and Oilers just from a super quick glance. If you get into a tandem look where a 1a 1b setup takes pressure of the current #1 and plenty of other teams enter the fray.
calgaryflames,lxrzltr,2024-11-18 11:32:54,Carolina would also consider him based on their current nightmare.
calgaryflames,lxov52d,2024-11-17 20:56:28,Another year. Another legendary u/ValorFenix giveaway. Awesome to have you as part of the community!
calgaryflames,lxotdsi,2024-11-17 20:45:41,Can't make it. Just coming here to say I love that you always do these give aways! You a true homie.

calgaryflames,lxowto3,2024-11-17 21:06:52,Would love to come cause who doesn’t love live hockey?! Thanks again for always doing these give aways!
calgaryflames,lxphjmj,2024-11-17 23:22:37,would be cool to go as i only really watch games online. thanks for the opportunity!

calgaryflames,lxsyxs6,2024-11-18 14:30:24,I would love to go to a Scratchy Tuesday game haven't been!
calgaryflames,lxp00p7,2024-11-17 21:26:40,Thanks! And it is that time of the year!
calgaryflames,lxp02h1,2024-11-17 21:26:58,Thanks! Wish you can make a game :)
calgaryflames,lxnqzmc,2024-11-17 17:01:44,Calgary should have gotten Dinobots matches with our university too
calgaryflames,lxnm7zh,2024-11-17 16:35:41,Did AI make this
calgaryflames,lxo9l3n,2024-11-17 18:48:17,Yeah minibots is either a slap in the face or just a terrible choice.  There are a couple of Inferno characters that would work best.  Or even the fire truck Hot Spot would work.
calgaryflames,lxoki2o,2024-11-17 19:51:28,1. Should be Dinobots. 2. Arizona isn’t even a team anymore.
calgaryflames,lxteo5r,2024-11-18 15:50:20,Arizona back in the league baybeeee
calgaryflames,lxo6tpl,2024-11-17 18:32:07,As a transformers fan and an nhl fan this is rather accurate and lots of these are spot on.   AI or not fun post.  Thanks
calgaryflames,lxo95uf,2024-11-17 18:45:46,Doesn’t look AI to me and given Vegas Utah and Seattle are missing I’m guessing this was made 10+ years ago.

calgaryflames,lxnmd3r,2024-11-17 16:36:27,Having him touching a cup is just cruel
calgaryflames,lxniz29,2024-11-17 16:17:52,Need iggy smoking a ciggy
calgaryflames,lxnxyk7,2024-11-17 17:40:38,this literally just made my day!! LOL
calgaryflames,lxo07fe,2024-11-17 17:53:28,Finally got his cup I guess 
calgaryflames,lxpnd2y,2024-11-18 00:05:39,…that’s supposed to be Iggy?
calgaryflames,lxnzdt5,2024-11-17 17:48:47,This is awesome!!
calgaryflames,lxn97d7,2024-11-17 15:26:13,He creepy
calgaryflames,lxp9sxb,2024-11-17 22:28:52,Not enough forehead crease.
calgaryflames,lxn2ro6,2024-11-17 14:51:16,It's bad when i legit thought this was real for a minute. And yet it wouldn't even surprise me if it were.What a garbage organization.
calgaryflames,lxn37gb,2024-11-17 14:53:37,Even worse than Georgiev this year is an insane feat
calgaryflames,lxnq0m8,2024-11-17 16:56:25,Goals Saved Above ExpectedWolf 6.0Vladar 1.7Markstrom. -1.3
calgaryflames,lxn5h5b,2024-11-17 15:06:03,At least they have Evan Bouchard though right?
calgaryflames,lxn46z3,2024-11-17 14:59:06,It doesn’t help Skinner that the lines in front of him can’t back check. McDavid had 2 points against the Leafs and was a game worst minus 3 this is a stat that I really enjoy seeing.
calgaryflames,lxnaopm,2024-11-17 15:34:13,Thought this was real for a second. Wouldn’t have been surprised either.
calgaryflames,lxnawod,2024-11-17 15:35:24,They're also considering bringing in McSorley to avenge the hit on Nurse last night.
calgaryflames,lxnc6h4,2024-11-17 15:42:19,![gif](giphy|NipFetnQOuKhW)I’m so excited to watch them tank this season.
calgaryflames,lxnnsyy,2024-11-17 16:44:20,Half believed the title for a second there. Thought there would be no fucking chance but… it is the Oilers
calgaryflames,lxnbwt3,2024-11-17 15:40:54,Holy shit it's bad when fourgiev is doing better than you...I almost feel bad since he's a home town 'Berta guy gotta be a lot of pressure
calgaryflames,lxnwyxv,2024-11-17 17:34:56,Lol you baited me hard. I really thought this was real reading the title
calgaryflames,lxn5bv1,2024-11-17 15:05:17,I heard it’s a package deal with Foote Dube and McLeod
calgaryflames,lxn4zkw,2024-11-17 15:03:29,Kindred spirits
calgaryflames,lxno6nv,2024-11-17 16:46:24,Does anybody know where that chart is sourced from?Like to see where Wolf and Vlad stack up
calgaryflames,lxnojkx,2024-11-17 16:48:22,What wow
calgaryflames,lxnwjyk,2024-11-17 17:32:36,It's just so shocking that the oilers need goaltending.
calgaryflames,lxnwapi,2024-11-17 17:31:11,You need a good defenseman and goaltending so you'll probably sign another winger.  ;)
calgaryflames,lxp7vv8,2024-11-17 22:16:18,Please tell me this is a joke
calgaryflames,lxs4359,2024-11-18 11:55:36,I dunno guys. We had Dube for like 3 years and it was pretty much an open secret who these guys were.
calgaryflames,lxn7vlj,2024-11-17 15:19:09,Read this last week.  https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1go8ggy/per_evolving_hockey_alexander_georgiev_is_on_pace/?sort=oldSkinner: Hold my Beer
calgaryflames,lxnsisz,2024-11-17 17:10:14,You have noticed him when he’s on the ice…. 
calgaryflames,lxn7ykb,2024-11-17 15:19:36,McD was 1st star.  Hard to imagine he must have been on ice for 4 GA.
calgaryflames,lxnsrlp,2024-11-17 17:11:35,https://moneypuck.com/goalies.htm
calgaryflames,lxpu5ny,2024-11-18 01:04:02,I will probably die on this hill but the Oilers need discipline and defense but everytime that’s the case fans and media go blame the goalie. I’ve not watched the Oilers as much since the Bison King project ended but from my limited exposure McDavid was far better at this the last two seasons than he’s ever been but somehow regressed. Drai is streaky. He can backcheck with aggression or he can be a bit lost at the defensive end. Nuge isn’t bad but is no Barkov Hyman I feel is one of the more responsible ones but I could be wrong and Doc isn’t as good as he was with us. Not going to go through all the other forwards and the D-core seems to forget that their primary responsibility is to help the goalie. Nurse especially and while I dislike Nurse as a 1st pairing D I’ve been saying he’d make a great winger and I hope he’ll recover. That hit was horrible.
calgaryflames,lxs6y4b,2024-11-18 12:10:12,Having a player with rumours about them and a player who is formally charged with a court date is very different. But if you wanna fire people based on rumours go for it.
calgaryflames,lxn888y,2024-11-17 15:21:00,That’s actually fucking nuts lmao that is the sweet prince the Oilers swore would win the Vezina this year too
calgaryflames,lxo5k41,2024-11-17 18:24:38,If both those points were PP he was on for three against. Could be up to five against if his points were both even strength.
calgaryflames,lxsgtdi,2024-11-18 12:59:31,It's the same player though. And people knew. And fans still cheered his name. It's one thing to still employ him but fans still liked him. And then act so righteous in comparison to other teams.
calgaryflames,lxtdzka,2024-11-18 15:46:54,Typically people wait for charges to actually be laid against someone (let alone an actual guilty verdict)But if you wanna make determinations about a person based on rumours go ahead.How do you differentiate between fans buying a Dube jersey and the GM signing him to a contract? You expect people to say “well he probably raped a girl so I won’t buy his jersey but it’s cool he plays for us bc he’s decent”If your position is that he was guilty in 2022 when he was playing for us you should be calling for his termination in 2022. Not just asking fans to “cheer for him less”Make up your mind
calgaryflames,lxtmw4a,2024-11-18 16:31:35,Wanted both. We waited until the very last minute. Is his contract even technically terminated? We waited for him to leave.
calgaryflames,lxtn34t,2024-11-18 16:32:36,Ok so we’re back to my first comment. If you wanna fire people based on rumours go for it.
calgaryflames,lxtnwds,2024-11-18 16:36:44,I'm down. Yeah. It was an open secret. We knew who the players were for at least 6 months. And that's people with zero insider information. Stop acting like the flames are saints. Ignorance is bliss is your argument.
calgaryflames,lxm3djs,2024-11-17 11:40:22,Love those jerseys. Super sad to hear about your loss but glad to hear your dad and you had such a great bond over the Flames and watching hockey.
calgaryflames,lxmex5l,2024-11-17 12:44:20,Welcome to the c of red and sorry for your loss my son and I also watch together. Even if he isn't a huge fan as he's still little it's so great to have him beside me for games. 
calgaryflames,lxmqrxq,2024-11-17 13:47:38,My dad passed away in 2023 and it’s the exact same thing for me. We had our struggles in our relationship but hockey always brought us back (thank god for 2004). I hear you about the connection you still feel with your dad over it. It’s why I’ll never stop cheering for this team. Somewhere your dad has box seats and he’s cheering along with you. Thanks for sharing
calgaryflames,lxm3ul8,2024-11-17 11:42:57,it's been a few years now it's a little easier to talk about finally. My Dad's Dad was an Oilers fan lucky my Dad made a change lol
calgaryflames,lxms70y,2024-11-17 13:55:07,thank you for sharing as well I couldn't watch Hockey for a few years after he passed because it hurt. There was something there that told me it was okay to give it another go a few years ago though and im so glad for it. His hand is forever on my shoulder I just wish I could feel it.
calgaryflames,lxm9as4,2024-11-17 12:13:06,We’re happy to have you OP!
calgaryflames,lxqjej8,2024-11-18 05:33:27,Maybe that hand on your shoulder was what was guiding you to fall into a community that meant something to him 
calgaryflames,lxt9oro,2024-11-18 15:25:08,thank you 
calgaryflames,lxj92ty,2024-11-16 21:41:59,I think you also missed Vladar Pospisil and Lomberg and probably a couple of the Wranglers ones too
calgaryflames,lxk39ib,2024-11-17 01:30:48,There is a signing for vladar at the cmp gm dealership on Nov 22 at 2-4 pm
calgaryflames,lxpxt44,2024-11-18 01:38:44,Late to the party but follow CrossIron Mills on IG if you have it. They just partnered with the Flames/Wranglers and will be hosting signing events occasionally.
calgaryflames,lxpeb23,2024-11-17 22:59:38,I would suggest following the Flames on social media. The Cross Iron Mills signing was well promoted there.
calgaryflames,lxj9obe,2024-11-16 21:45:57,When was that?

calgaryflames,lxh033r,2024-11-16 13:47:44,6th in save percentage too hot damn. Maybe should have posted that one... But slotting him right about Marky was too perfect
calgaryflames,lxh0l5l,2024-11-16 13:50:24,Even more impressive he's 6th in the league in save % if you rule out some of the guys who haven't played that much (Andersen DeSmith etc...). I've always considered save % a superior stat to GAA. Either way our man is a stud.
calgaryflames,lxgz55s,2024-11-16 13:42:43,Awooooo
calgaryflames,lxiefyy,2024-11-16 18:28:36,Wolf also has the third best goals saved over expected among goalies that have started at least 9 games. That’s crazy.  You know what’s awesome is that he looks better each game. Confidence is growing.
calgaryflames,lxhfc9y,2024-11-16 15:09:50,Get this guy a fuckin puppers
calgaryflames,lxigg3e,2024-11-16 18:41:12,Gotta love that he’s one spot up on Marky
calgaryflames,lxm7rk3,2024-11-17 12:04:33,I remember when Johnny first joined the team we were so devoid of talent that he was the sole reason I kept showing up to watch games. It’s a similar thing now with Wolf.I am by no means a goalie nerd but the way that he tracks the puck his push from left to right how generally smooth and borderline cocky he is have made the games fun to watch. I feel so damn confident with him between the pipes.It’s still early…but…we might have our goalie?
calgaryflames,lxp8vwp,2024-11-17 22:22:50,There's no way he's higher than Markstrom 
calgaryflames,lxpnjz2,2024-11-18 00:07:10,Jacob who?Just kidding I love Marky but we gotta move on and focus on the future.
calgaryflames,lxj56we,2024-11-16 21:16:14,Time to give Wolf the majority of the starts over Vladar Vladar is a below average backup. I want to see how Wolf handles the pressure of being an every day starter no reason to start Vladar unless it's back to back games Imo
calgaryflames,lxig6sh,2024-11-16 18:39:36,Ewww don't can him that
calgaryflames,lxk0iym,2024-11-17 01:06:11,Only .05 behind Hellebuyck and .07 behind the three tied for league lead at .927.This kid is the real deal.
calgaryflames,lxh21za,2024-11-16 13:58:15,Yup I noticed that right after I posted this haha but being above Markstrom was too good to not post
calgaryflames,lxi3lxm,2024-11-16 17:23:14,that's because sv% is a superior stat to GAA. They often correlate (in the basic sense that a better of one is a better of the other) but GAA is also dependent on the team whereas sv% is solely the tendy
calgaryflames,lxiuouj,2024-11-16 20:09:13,"It's interesting too if you look at the advanced metrics.For players with equal or more games to him (35 total):- 9th in goals saved above expected- 3rd in goals saved above expected/60 minutes (suggesting the Flames give up more opportunities per minute than some of the other teams)- While closer to average at medium and high risk shots he has an amazingly high low risk save % even compared to expectation (I believe they use distance from the net and position on the ice as the traditional metric to measure shot ""threat"").  It's pretty rare for Wolf to give up a weak goal based on their definitions. - Just for comparison's sake you have streakier goalies on the other side of the spectrum like Skinner and Georgiev who have their save %s in low risk situations weighed down.What this suggests to me is that Wolf has done great at the long range shots something the Flames have been surrendering a lot for him.I see Dostal and Hellebuyck as players with comparable stat lines in quite a few of these metrics.  While obviously sample size is small (and the league hasn't had a chance to really study Wolf yet to pick at his weaknesses) it's a pretty strong endorsement if those are the names you're next to."
calgaryflames,lxp41kf,2024-11-17 21:51:36,Jesus if he keeps this up… he may become the next Tom Barrasso (Won the Calder and Vezina in ‘85)
calgaryflames,lxm23p9,2024-11-17 11:33:22,Sv% is definitely not solely on the tendy but I agree that it is better than GAA

calgaryflames,lxhlsam,2024-11-16 15:45:08,Okay Dwayne
calgaryflames,lxg2yh3,2024-11-16 10:49:50,We need an all saves highlight video. Wolf played out of his mind last night
calgaryflames,lxgrsnk,2024-11-16 13:03:46,There’s only two goals and the first clip starts one second before it’s in the net. What a highlight reel.
calgaryflames,lxgs3lr,2024-11-16 13:05:22,On the nhl YT channel that first goal also starts 1 second before the goal is scored
calgaryflames,lxfsb4h,2024-11-16 09:47:00,Accessibility at the Saddledome absolutely sucks. You'll need to go into the Telus club entrance to get help but that's the only way to get an elevator to the main concourse.. There is lots of walking still from there but they have a wheelchair they can use to help at the Telus club.
calgaryflames,lxgsxde,2024-11-16 13:09:47,I would recommend to drop your partner off at the loop on Saddledome rise. There is usually security posted at the bottom of the road but if you talk to them they should let you up as this is the designated drop off zone for handicapped. I don’t have a handicapped placard for my vehicle but have dropped people off this way before. From there it’s no stairs to get to the concourse and your section is just inside that entrance to the left. Only a section over. I would recommend to arrive early so there are less lineups to scan in and go through security. There will be stairs up to the seats from the concourse. The entrance into the arena bowl for the second level seats would be at row 5 for your section. Feel free to message me if I can provide more details on anything.
calgaryflames,lxgyh6d,2024-11-16 13:39:10,Saddledome accessibility sucks. The new arena addresses all the problems with it fortunately but you’re stuck with this.Like seriously there isn’t a public elevator that goes to the main concourse If you’re taking transit or ridesharing or getting dropped off I’d recommend the northeast entrance since there is a road that drives right up to it.If you’re driving the second level of the parkade accesses one of the east entrances directly. You’ll be very close to 214 from both entrances.Enjoy the show!
calgaryflames,lxgimbq,2024-11-16 12:15:05,Haven’t you posted this multiple times already?  I think this is the third time I’ve seen this posted.
calgaryflames,lxgn0dh,2024-11-16 12:38:32,The elevator at the Telus club entrance goes to the Saddleroom level only it DOES NOT stop on the concourse. OP If you can park in the parkade on the top level then you can exit directly onto the concourse level with no stairs and enter via the east entrance. Once there section 214 is basically right in front of you once you're inside. Once at the section there will then be stairs up to whatever row you're in.
calgaryflames,lxfshk1,2024-11-16 09:48:08,Thank you.  He’s really stressed about it.

calgaryflames,lxfo9ic,2024-11-16 09:21:00,That was the first game I've attended this season. So good to see Wolfy get his first shutout! Especially against Saros someone he has certainly looked up to coming up. I thought nothing would make those last ten minutes more stressful then the crowd started with the wave!
calgaryflames,lxfw4fr,2024-11-16 10:10:21,Great game from Wolf Zary Pachal Coronato and Bahl. I'm so conflicted wanting a high draft pick and also wanting this group to win because theyre so damn likeable lol
calgaryflames,lxfw7j2,2024-11-16 10:10:52,This shutout wasn't just given to him easy neither. He was tracking everywhere and made some incredible saves. I don't have any doubts he is a franchise goalie.

calgaryflames,lxfy1bw,2024-11-16 10:21:41,I feel very confident saying that Wolf is the first goalie in the 22 years I’ve watched this team that the Flames have drafted and developed into an actual starter in the NHL. Hell he could potentially be a Veznia candidate in the next few years if all goes right.
calgaryflames,lxfps1d,2024-11-16 09:30:50,I must say and I can't stress this enough AWOOOOOOOOOOO!

calgaryflames,lxgfgze,2024-11-16 11:58:06,That was the seventh game I've been to against Nashville and the first time I've seen us beat them in person. It was a long time coming but I guess Wolf was the answer. 
calgaryflames,lxftzb1,2024-11-16 09:57:26,Clap for the Wolfman!

calgaryflames,lxfweht,2024-11-16 10:12:02,Always want wins.  Draft picks don’t mean wins.  Look how long the Oilers had high draft picks and still sucked.  Columbus has had a fair number and still sucked.  Buffalo is finally doing good after how many years
calgaryflames,lxg4s0q,2024-11-16 10:59:52,I don't think there's been a homegrown star goalie in the organization since Mike Vernon really. Trevor Kidd was drafted and developed by the Flames and he was a starter for a few years but he was always kind of a fringe starter.
calgaryflames,lxgow6t,2024-11-16 12:48:27,The Flames have had too many GMs that would have abandoned Wolf or traded him for a 3rd round pick. They would regularly use a draft pick on a goaltender and then rarely use him for more than a few games it’s been a very frustrating 30 years.
calgaryflames,lxisboq,2024-11-16 19:54:20,Laurent Brassoi
calgaryflames,lxishc9,2024-11-16 19:55:19,I think Ryan orielly has rabies

calgaryflames,lxh5l33,2024-11-16 14:17:03,He’d need to get the bulk of the starts and maintain his numbers.  Not sure the Flames want him playing 55 games
calgaryflames,lxg3upy,2024-11-16 10:54:44,Also... you can get great great players outside the top 10. Drafting is a numbers game and we have a whole bunch of picks in the first 2 rounds of next year's draft and had a great haul in this year's draft too.It's not all drafting too. Development matters just as much if not more. The Wranglers seem to be doing a great job turning draft picks into players.
calgaryflames,lxg1039,2024-11-16 10:38:51,Exactly. A winning culture and positive attitudes are so important. Sure high picks are generally a pretty significant boost but not a guarantee every time.
calgaryflames,lxg5w62,2024-11-16 11:05:57,Yea I don't disagree but this team really lacks game changers best centers are gone early and elite C is something this team needs in the future. I will always cheer for dubs but I won't be disapponted either if they get to keep their 1st rd pick lol
calgaryflames,lxg7sle,2024-11-16 11:16:22,And montreal and the sharks and the Blackhawks. All got good picks all still firmly in the basement. I thinking keeping some veterans who are kinda good around helps when we bring kids up and allows them to find their grove better.
calgaryflames,lxgfebj,2024-11-16 11:57:43,St Louis had a chance to tank it in the 18-19 season. Up comes a young Canadian talent by the name of Jordan Binnington. I can't help but think there's this vibe in the locker room....while not wholly akin to the Blues and Binnington...you can see it... think they can win against all odds... IT'S EXCITING!!! AWOOOO!!!!
calgaryflames,lxiisqa,2024-11-16 18:55:48,And notably the pieces that are working for them weren’t all drafted/high picks. Edit: Buffalo I mean. Thompson is arguably their most important player and was an acquisition. 
calgaryflames,lxispm2,2024-11-16 19:56:43,I’m going to say he doesn’t really count given that he played all of 2 games for the Abbotsford Heat and that’s it. We had little to do with his development
calgaryflames,lxg7lxl,2024-11-16 11:15:20,We have a decent track record for drafting in the later rounds too. Wolf Mangipane Gaudreau (RIP king) Fox (fuck you) Kulak and Brodie were all drafted in the 3rd round or later and have had solid careers
calgaryflames,lxg5qus,2024-11-16 11:05:10,They sure do.  My son and are heading up to a Wranglers game in DecemberWe are looking forward to it
calgaryflames,lxhj1v6,2024-11-16 15:30:16,I heard zary was playing C last night?
calgaryflames,lxgmeos,2024-11-16 12:35:19,Yes Wolf is great To me tanking seems to fail more than it succeeds

calgaryflames,lxh2lxl,2024-11-16 14:01:11,Is there any chance someone playing in the Japanese league is a super star that we could bring over ala Ohtani?
calgaryflames,lxiproo,2024-11-16 19:38:37,In this moment you didn't shake hands with an Oilers fan. You shook hands with a Nagoya Orques fan.
calgaryflames,lxg16dh,2024-11-16 10:39:51,Wholesome.
calgaryflames,lxhjlh0,2024-11-16 15:33:14,You’re agreeing to cheer for a team with an orca as a symbol?This makes zero sense.
calgaryflames,lxpo161,2024-11-18 00:11:01,Google didn’t help much but i’m gonna be in Tokyo for a week at the start of December. Does Japan have their own league? I can’t find any info online but i’d love to go to a game in Tokyo if possible.
calgaryflames,lxh8f1v,2024-11-16 14:32:14,Gross
calgaryflames,lxhv3x3,2024-11-16 16:35:56,This is they gayest thing I’ve seen today
calgaryflames,lxfknql,2024-11-16 08:56:57,Don’t worry. It was just for the one game.
calgaryflames,lxguhcj,2024-11-16 13:18:06,Oh...these dudes ANIME.
calgaryflames,lxjjmi3,2024-11-16 22:52:58,The skill level was impressive but it definitely wasn’t like all-star level. If I had to put the skill equivalent I felt I was watching a lower end major midget hockey. There were a few players that did standout like the goalkeeper made a few nice saves. The majority of the team was getting gassed like 30 seconds into their shift tho. Bad timings on shift changes actually cost Nagoya two goals. It was fun but no hockey Ohtani in this league.
calgaryflames,lxjago5,2024-11-16 21:51:11,"The last real homegrown Japanese talent I remember hearing about was Aito Iguchi. Genuinely one of the most skilled players I've ever seen but I think he only grew to be like 5'5"" or something. I think he's still trying to make it across the pond but I don't think he'll ever truly make the jump."
calgaryflames,lxps0fp,2024-11-18 00:44:38,There is the Asia league with the closest team to Tokyo being the Yokohama Grits. This one I went to was a summer league apparently.
calgaryflames,lxiddxw,2024-11-16 18:21:59,So far
calgaryflames,lxsamva,2024-11-18 12:28:44,As long as this isn‘t meant as a compliment - which it should be - you can fuck right off
calgaryflames,lxielsq,2024-11-16 18:29:37,Still... soap and water scrub for 30 seconds or more.
calgaryflames,lxecrg1,2024-11-16 01:56:15,Funny thing is Tysons and Paul's fight didn't actually start until after the game ended
calgaryflames,lxfeqdu,2024-11-16 08:15:21,The Tyson fight was a shutout also. Shut out of being entertaining shut out from streaming properly shut out of being a watchable event shut out of having knowledgeable commentators….(although the two undercard matches were pretty good).
calgaryflames,lxedj3o,2024-11-16 02:03:48,There were two pretty great fights before it though! I had to watch the main event on twitch because Netflix crashed lmao.
calgaryflames,lxi57nf,2024-11-16 17:32:31,https://preview.redd.it/vro0hxhlbc1e1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e184b161e5d2f2b6d1104e58028c2f77b3bf60c
calgaryflames,lxgicg0,2024-11-16 12:13:37,You mean you watched a screen buffer?
calgaryflames,lxedgak,2024-11-16 02:03:01,Game was blacked out for me and all my pirate sites are busted. Glad I didn’t watch that “fight” tho lmao what a joke AWOOOOOOOOO
calgaryflames,lxei70o,2024-11-16 02:52:43,I was at work but I got off early enough to watch the lame fight. I'm an idiot.
calgaryflames,lxemt8x,2024-11-16 03:43:40,Literally same I'm so annoyed lmaoo
calgaryflames,lxetfvb,2024-11-16 04:58:53,I watched it on a pirate site and I still felt ripped off. Good thing I was at work tonight with nothing else to do or else that would've been the biggest waste of 4 hours ever
calgaryflames,lxfhkor,2024-11-16 08:35:36,Why would anyone watch an elderly fight?
calgaryflames,lxfslfb,2024-11-16 09:48:48,Well I watched both and I was incredibly disappointed in my choice after Wolfies FIRST NHL SHUTOUT!!! Awooooooooo. I should have watched post game presser instead hahaha although I heard the ladies fighting was the highlight of the night.
calgaryflames,lxfd513,2024-11-16 08:03:29,I watched the flames game on my phone and wached the last 2 fights on the tv when I got home from work. I could easily watch both on my phone at the same time if I needed too. Never skip a flames game folks!
calgaryflames,lxgj8p4,2024-11-16 12:18:26,I watched one on my phone and one on the TV and the hockey game was way better although the scorelessness was pretty long to watch.
calgaryflames,lxgnl2j,2024-11-16 12:41:34,I watched the game and then watched the fight. I’m also incredibly disappointed.
calgaryflames,lxh6rjs,2024-11-16 14:23:24,Went to the pub with some friends expecting they’d maybe show the Tyson fight and the flames game. Only the flames game and I’m glad didn’t miss out on anything it seems
calgaryflames,lxjmyag,2024-11-16 23:17:10,Okay maybe a big UFC match but... boxing? I'll punch then we can hug for a while then you punch and we can hug some more until the ref tells us to stop.I'd almost watch baseball before boxing and that's saying a lot.
calgaryflames,lxeg6kg,2024-11-16 02:31:12,lol I watched both game was way more entertaining
calgaryflames,lxel8u6,2024-11-16 03:25:50,That's not funny at all!! (for me) Hahaha fuuuuck
calgaryflames,lxed20s,2024-11-16 01:59:05,My thoughts exactly...
calgaryflames,lxhpxyb,2024-11-16 16:07:42,That fight was better choreographed than any WWE match I've ever seen.
calgaryflames,lxegcna,2024-11-16 02:33:01,Same the fight was so boring Tyson barely threw any punches past the first two rounds
calgaryflames,lxeqf2a,2024-11-16 04:24:32,The two fights before the main event were really good though especially Taylor vs. Serrano
calgaryflames,lxeolwf,2024-11-16 04:04:03,I'll never forgive the dictionary people for butchering the definition of literal
calgaryflames,lxgnh45,2024-11-16 12:40:58,Dustin is literally a Wolf tho
calgaryflames,lxe4lrm,2024-11-16 00:45:29,Him

losangeleskings,lxow040,2024-11-17 21:01:45,The only thing that's included is the VIP entrance.  Food and drinks are not included but you do have a Strapless Center employee assigned to your area that facilitates food and drink orders from your seat so you don't have to go wait in line should you choose.

losangeleskings,lxphzzt,2024-11-17 23:25:52,Also you only can choose from the arena concessions and not from the actual variety of restaurants in the rest of the arena unless you wanna tracks a long walk to the main area. You’re basically limited to hot dogs nachos and tenders.
losangeleskings,lxr8erk,2024-11-18 08:59:01,For sure. The seats are a little wider and more comfortable than anywhere else
losangeleskings,lxp484z,2024-11-17 21:52:45,If you look closely they are. Thus I'm leaving it
losangeleskings,lxo506i,2024-11-17 18:21:24,I’d give him the Sharks if he’s still up.
losangeleskings,lxombpo,2024-11-17 20:02:27,Ducks on the 29th if Rittich doesn’t get pulled before then. No back to backs until then and I don’t see them rushing him out there until he’d be needed for something like that.

losangeleskings,lxp1ct2,2024-11-17 21:35:03,"I personally wouldn't hold your breath. Portillo is a last ditch option as the Kings have a fairly cushy schedule and coaches often will play a known commodity over an untested and unproven rookie. There's a chance we may see him on the 29th or 30th if he's still up but I've seen coaches play their veteran over the kid if they had a choice because something something ""pOiNtS"""

losangeleskings,lxjisg4,2024-11-16 22:47:15,Impressive that the team didn't commit penalties the entire game. Way to keep it clean 
losangeleskings,lxjj3vk,2024-11-16 22:49:23,Lmao Kempe going Bardown on the EN is hilarious.
losangeleskings,lxjhpzb,2024-11-16 22:40:07,Solid game so heartbreakingly close to a shutout. Kings didn't take a penalty tonight either for the first time this season. Something to build upon.
losangeleskings,lxjkx5e,2024-11-16 23:02:11,60 minute effort great to see. Curious about Turc he seemed okay heading off the ice after the game. Foegele and Laffy stood out in this one. Nice to see us becoming a good home team as well. GKG much needed +2Edit: Hiller said it was planned for Turc. Not injury or punishment related just didn’t wanna load him up first game back fresh guys after a few days off.

losangeleskings,lxjjp56,2024-11-16 22:53:29,Pretty much a stress free full 60 minute game. Just hate the late goal to kill the shutout. But I won’t nitpick haha.
losangeleskings,lxji3l8,2024-11-16 22:42:36,Awesome game everyone on the team played at least a solid game in my opinionPLEASE keep Moverare up he is excellent as per usual and he makes Spence look much better as well Spence seemed very comfortable compared to how he has beenA little concerned about Turcotte not sure why he was just sitting on the bench for a lot of the game.  Hopefully not injury related but he definitely didn't play bad enough to be benched in his limited time (although he did seem a little off but that's to be expected coming back from an injury)Still concerned about the finishing ability of this team Talbot was good for Detroit but we should have scored more than 3 goals on him.  It was absolute domination for the Kings regardless so great winEdit: Hiller said he just wanted to give Turcotte half the game not to push him so all should be good
losangeleskings,lxjiiw9,2024-11-16 22:45:29,Frustrated that it wasn’t a shutout but oh well. Something to build on for the playoffs.
losangeleskings,lxk8n1a,2024-11-17 02:23:04,The TENNNNDERRR Talbot chant made me a little sad tbh.
losangeleskings,lxjhtoj,2024-11-16 22:40:49,Much needed win and needed boost with Turcotte and Jeannot back in the lineup. Moverare looked fine yet again let's see how many games he's given before being inevitably sent down lol
losangeleskings,lxjhzi4,2024-11-16 22:41:52,Great Win. On to the next! GKG
losangeleskings,lxjk791,2024-11-16 22:57:02,These two kids in the background of the post game think they’re so cool
losangeleskings,lxjtlf5,2024-11-17 00:08:35,I honestly did not expect the absolute dominance we put out there tonight. Great game to attend in person.  Felt like everyone was doing the hard work and playing responsibly.
losangeleskings,lxjuh4y,2024-11-17 00:15:55,Good shit.  GKG
losangeleskings,lxjtys3,2024-11-17 00:11:43,I guess Yzerman is a mediocre GM when the previous staff doesn’t gift him a deep prospect pool and solid core of players to build a team from

losangeleskings,lxnqxl2,2024-11-17 17:01:25,Yes it was just the redwings but my big takeaway from this game and I don’t think this is anything we don’t already know but maybe hadn’t seen so clearly on the ice before is that our 5-on-5 is dominant. If we could just avoid special teams both for and against we’d be a whole lot better off.
losangeleskings,lxjj1xp,2024-11-16 22:49:01,Seriously and I don't think there were any egregious missed calls either Kings played a clean game finally while controlling the play as well
losangeleskings,lxjj4sl,2024-11-16 22:49:34,I definitely seen a few missed in the first one Detroit holding tripping
losangeleskings,lxjwmnt,2024-11-17 00:33:56,Straight showing off
losangeleskings,lxjqgbp,2024-11-16 23:44:09,Still not sure if I agree with this decision but I’m at least glad to see that this was planned. Turc was electric like usual in the first and I was confused as to why he rode the pine so much after.
losangeleskings,lxk2ea9,2024-11-17 01:23:22,Wouldn’t not mentioning it to him cause him to overthink tho lol
losangeleskings,lxjivlb,2024-11-16 22:47:51,It's not like he's too soft or something either he plays with some physicality he can move the puck he can shoot the puck he is excellent defensively... like why is Moverare not a mainstay on our 3rd pair lol
losangeleskings,lxm006d,2024-11-17 11:21:54,I could be wrong but I highly doubt Turcotte had no idea why he was “benched” when it occurred. I’m sure Hiller just didn’t want to inform him before game but let him know once he decided mid game.
losangeleskings,lxkczlf,2024-11-17 03:09:32,true but also overthinking once he’s off the ice is better than overthinking AND trying to play if he knew

losangeleskings,lxh7x0w,2024-11-16 14:29:33,100% I understand you need a backup goalie but I hate when kids get recalled just to ride the pine
losangeleskings,lxgzgq4,2024-11-16 13:44:27,Agreed. I’ve seen rookie keepers ignite stagnant teams time and time again over the years.It puts the vets on notice and hopefully gets a little extra effort out of them.Give him a chance 100%. Rittich has had 1 or 2 decent games but he’s probably (definitely) in the bottom 10% of goalkeepers in the league right now.
losangeleskings,lxh97ow,2024-11-16 14:36:30,Agreed but if Rittich starts tonight it’ll be a fun matchup of our 2 goalies from last year.
losangeleskings,lxhecjb,2024-11-16 15:04:23,I support this. The Redwings are a weaker team it would give the Kings a reason to be sharper and protect the kid and if Portillo has been hot as you say (I haven’t been following the Reign much) this would be a great opportunity to get him in. But at the same time I think you have to stick with Rittich. He’s the veteran he’s played well (but not great) so I think it’s his to loose. If this was a hack to back thing it would be different. Portillo will get his starts but today isn’t one.
losangeleskings,lxhpuk9,2024-11-16 16:07:11,I would love to play the kid but I think Rittich has to lose the sport before he gets in.
losangeleskings,lxiz4ll,2024-11-16 20:37:12,I thought I was in r/foodlosangeles for a second and this was about someone trying to open a Portillo’s in LA

losangeleskings,lxidrwb,2024-11-16 18:24:25,My take is the Kuemper will be back soon. This is an opportunity for Portillo to get a quick taste of the NHL and he doesn’t have to clear waivers to go back down (unlike Copley).
losangeleskings,lxihpiw,2024-11-16 18:49:04,Agreed 100%
losangeleskings,lxh3xgq,2024-11-16 14:08:14,Exactly my thoughts. Portillo has been hot too.
losangeleskings,lxhmzy6,2024-11-16 15:51:45,This is funny because Portillo will likely get zero playing time while he’s up because our FO and coaching staff suck
losangeleskings,lxhsh48,2024-11-16 16:21:33,Martin Jones comes to mind when talking about an added spark. Remember his shoot out performance against the Ducks?

ottawasenators,lxtrz9a,2024-11-18 16:57:23,We (Pens) had Kapanen TWICE. he sucked. I don't recommend
ottawasenators,lxtpqch,2024-11-18 16:46:01,Much rather save room to improve D depth.
ottawasenators,lxu8bar,2024-11-18 18:26:49,I think we need defense not really more forward !
ottawasenators,lxtfl6y,2024-11-18 15:54:53,Sure. He's a slight improvement over Zack Macewen
ottawasenators,lxtfi5c,2024-11-18 15:54:27,No
ottawasenators,lxtmv51,2024-11-18 16:31:27,22 point is 73 games last year isn't really good enough for a guy who's supposed to be an offensive player.Only reason we know his name is because he was an overhyped Leafs prospect. Also his alcohol/anxiety/sex tape issues are probably not a good sign
ottawasenators,lxtera5,2024-11-18 15:50:46,no
ottawasenators,lxtsm2o,2024-11-18 17:00:37,tbh yeah. 1M is buryable and he is a 28yo W who has a bit of upside.
ottawasenators,lxtn2x0,2024-11-18 16:32:34,There's a Kapanen sex tape? 
ottawasenators,lxtowgv,2024-11-18 16:41:49,Unfortunately yes I very much wish I hadn’t seen it lmao
ottawasenators,lxta7cq,2024-11-18 15:27:45,Unfortunately I have no good memories of the trips to Sweden.
ottawasenators,lxtauwp,2024-11-18 15:31:06,Can’t be because of the alcohol prices in Sweden make Ottawa look like a bargain!
ottawasenators,lxtmd92,2024-11-18 16:28:57,More to do with team performance after these trips :)
ottawasenators,lxtoiqw,2024-11-18 16:39:52,2-0 last year during trip but post trip yep.  Crap GM though so future trips should be fine.  Really hoping for a Germany trip in a couple years to be honest.
ottawasenators,lxt2d3u,2024-11-18 14:47:44,Fuck those metro points are gonna hurt if/when it comes down to the Wildcard race.
ottawasenators,lxt2eys,2024-11-18 14:47:59,Last year when we got “back to .500” it’s usually because we won a game and moved up to it.Now we’re losing a game to go back to .500 if we keep bubbling above .500 that’s a pretty big improvement.
ottawasenators,lxt2hk2,2024-11-18 14:48:21,When you look at it like this I’m not that worried. We have lost to the four best teams in the Metro and aside from that we’re actually kinda balling. As well if week win all four games this week we’re gonna be set.
ottawasenators,lxt3pqp,2024-11-18 14:54:34,Love this graphic great job
ottawasenators,lxt3l87,2024-11-18 14:53:56,Putrid against metro
ottawasenators,lxt81vd,2024-11-18 15:16:45,We really need to go on a decent streak here. Any team that makes the playoffs typically has some stretch of 10 games where they go 8-2 or so. Having that kind of stretch allows you to pretty much play .500 hockey the rest of the way and have a good chance at a wildcard because of the sprinkle of OTL points too. So far we’re holding serve but we need to stay above .500 until we find a stretch to really go on a great streak.
ottawasenators,lxt3z99,2024-11-18 14:55:53,Seems like we just need to figure out the metropolitan division
ottawasenators,lxt4ft9,2024-11-18 14:58:13,Metro has been a rough one..
ottawasenators,lxtamte,2024-11-18 15:29:57,Fuck the Metro. All my homies hate the Metro.
ottawasenators,lxtktsg,2024-11-18 16:21:10,My brain strongly dislikes the orange in these diagrams.
ottawasenators,lxt4eog,2024-11-18 14:58:04,Yeah but at least it isn’t the Atlantic.
ottawasenators,lxubj5r,2024-11-18 18:45:31,Meh NJ and NYR are both teams I expect to be top 3 our biggest competitors are WSH NYI PIT
ottawasenators,lxu8pmh,2024-11-18 18:29:08,Still need around a 0.567 to make the playoffs 
ottawasenators,lxu8v68,2024-11-18 18:30:00,Well 3 of the best. the islanders loss is probably a bigger stain than the OTL to philly
ottawasenators,lxt5v9d,2024-11-18 15:05:29,Tbh we got goalied against the rangers (a game we win 9 times out of 10) and Ullmark lost us the game against Philly (a game we should have won)
ottawasenators,lxtnder,2024-11-18 16:34:03,Just gotta play Pens and CBJ
ottawasenators,lxu0bq8,2024-11-18 17:41:43,Gimme a colour that makes sense unless you mean you just hate OTL.
ottawasenators,lxt4iko,2024-11-18 14:58:36,This is true just need to be better than the Wildcard race..
ottawasenators,lxubcqu,2024-11-18 18:44:29,Right of course still a full season left but last year around this time we’d be fluttering between .430 and .500This year we’re fluttering between .500 and .570
ottawasenators,lxu2l75,2024-11-18 17:54:05,Maybe just white?
ottawasenators,lxu66so,2024-11-18 18:14:31,Poop brown. That’s what you get when you mix red and green. Also how an OTL/SOL makes me feel lol
ottawasenators,lxu6ak5,2024-11-18 18:15:06,Also greatly appreciate these posts!
ottawasenators,lxu9i9l,2024-11-18 18:33:44,Not the poster you're replying to but orange makes sense here even if it looks a bit odd. Red is for a loss so something between red and green makes sense and given that an OTL is a *loss* makes sense that you use the colour closest to red.
ottawasenators,lxt4zjk,2024-11-18 15:00:57,Hahaha I think we will be competing for it…. hahaha It’s only one game against each of them though.
ottawasenators,lxt5dge,2024-11-18 15:02:56,Hahaha I think we will be competing for it…. hahaha It’s only one game against each of them though.
ottawasenators,lxt25qk,2024-11-18 14:46:42,Definitely a big week but I'm not even going to start thinking about playoffs until we fix our away form
ottawasenators,lxtkqjg,2024-11-18 16:20:43,I'll lower my expectations so I won't be too disappointed!
ottawasenators,lxtwapp,2024-11-18 17:20:06,Oilers Vegas and Vancouver are all very good teams and Calgary is playing solid hockey. Getting 4 points would be a good outcome; even down to 2 points isn't going to cause any issues. 0 points would be rough but it's a tough month so just staying in the hunt is a reasonable goal.
ottawasenators,lxt5v5x,2024-11-18 15:05:28,I swear we've sucked on the road for years. I don't get it.  Can't even blame coaches at this point.Why can't we play like we played against the Leafs for even half our road games?
ottawasenators,lxt6eyf,2024-11-18 15:08:18,I think they play well in Toronto is due to hate they have towards the Leafs.
ottawasenators,lxtqbgx,2024-11-18 16:48:57,If it's that simple they should just pretend every team is the leafs. Thanks Michael I'll take my check in chocolate loonies thanks
ottawasenators,lxsrwxm,2024-11-18 13:55:16,So sad we never won the cup with this team
ottawasenators,lxsubnc,2024-11-18 14:07:19,05-06 was better than the 06-07 team that made the finals.
ottawasenators,lxssmm7,2024-11-18 13:58:47,Did you also just listen to Heatley's interview on Missin Curfew? Was definitely a great walk down memory lane when he talked about his time here and how great the teams were.
ottawasenators,lxt7qet,2024-11-18 15:15:07,There's been no team that was as negatively hit by the salary cap as Ottawa. It's really hard to impress upon people how badly Ottawa's timing was.We were dead broke in the 90s and early 2000s where we barely holding the roster together with relying on amazing drafting. You couldn't afford a vet as any decent older player was a free agent and paid about five times too much by teams like the Leafs and Rangers. So just young guys all around with occasional chances on lesser known vets who you lose after a season.Then the team gets decent ownership but loses it's most competitive year to the lockout which included the hall of fame goalie we always needed. We then emerge in the cap era with the ability to spend but up against a cap.Top free agents like Chara went for $7.5M which is $15M as proportion of cap space today more than what the top guys are making right now.
ottawasenators,lxt1zng,2024-11-18 14:45:50,I remember being in grade 7 and writing down the names and numbers of every player on the team to kill time in school. The good ol days 
ottawasenators,lxta880,2024-11-18 15:27:52,Those early 2000s years were really the peak years of this franchise to date. That 2002-2003 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 teams were the best times for this franchise to win a Cup. They got absolutely crushed in the '07 finals and then the team started slowly but surely unravelling after Heatley wanted out. It's definitely been an up and down rollercoaster over the 15+ years since them
ottawasenators,lxt9w3i,2024-11-18 15:26:10,I will go to my grave believing two things: 1) The Sens would have won the cup in 2005 if there had been no lockout. 2) The Sens would have won the cup in 2007 if Hasek had not been injured
ottawasenators,lxssi3g,2024-11-18 13:58:09,They also had more fun after the games than any other team in the league so I've heard
ottawasenators,lxsxy4v,2024-11-18 14:25:27,Those damn ducks
ottawasenators,lxsucxy,2024-11-18 14:07:30,Neiler getting 28/33 points is insane… and 177+ mins in the bin too.
ottawasenators,lxtfbuz,2024-11-18 15:53:35,I forgot how good Peter Schaefer was at putting up points (for a largely unheralded player).
ottawasenators,lxssmsg,2024-11-18 13:58:48,Preissing Corvo Redden Meszaros all next to each other in points
ottawasenators,lxt4nou,2024-11-18 14:59:18,This team should've in hindsight got a cup thats a stacked team.
ottawasenators,lxta3mu,2024-11-18 15:27:14,McGrattan the missing puzzle piece rn

ottawasenators,lxst13r,2024-11-18 14:00:47,the good old days
ottawasenators,lxtdz5n,2024-11-18 15:46:51,One of my favorite teams apart from Calgary when I was a kid. Watched every post-season game of theirs and was crushed that they couldn't put it all together in the SCF. Very difficult Ducks team to overcome.
ottawasenators,lxtb6tn,2024-11-18 15:32:47,Almost 20 years later it still stings. We've never really had a competition quality roster since those teams.
ottawasenators,lxu38ap,2024-11-18 17:57:38,Melnyk got in shit and then divorced
ottawasenators,lxsyal2,2024-11-18 14:27:11,Especially since we had Chara and Hasek
ottawasenators,lxtnj32,2024-11-18 16:34:52,Hasek injury was the year before wasn't it? In 06 (Olympic year). I think we were running Emery as our starter in 07
ottawasenators,lxtjpk7,2024-11-18 16:15:34,Emery and Redden were often seen out at night with strangely dilated pupils.
ottawasenators,lxtvq71,2024-11-18 17:17:02,Redden and Emery were cocaine cowboys.
ottawasenators,lxtwgxx,2024-11-18 17:21:02,The league really did them wrong. There was two weeks in between rounds so the ducks could get healthier. Also Pronger (one of the dirtiest players ever IMO) skills have gotten a lot more than a game. He went head hunting and the book skills have been thrown at him. His case was one of the few times I was happy to see someone get a concussion.
ottawasenators,lxsv78q,2024-11-18 14:11:42,And no suspensions
ottawasenators,lxu48bl,2024-11-18 18:03:16,Preissing lead the league in +/- for a good part of the season
ottawasenators,lxtjben,2024-11-18 16:13:36,On the other hand watching the pizza line rip every other first line in the league new assholes was amazing.Also those regular season games against the Leafs and Habs when the Sens would bury them with 5 goals dig up their corpses and bury them again with another 5 goals were simply wonderful!
ottawasenators,lxszokf,2024-11-18 14:34:09,Those were the 2 big ones but we also had Havlat (who was unreal in playoffs) and Smolinski up front
ottawasenators,lxt2j7f,2024-11-18 14:48:35,We still had Smolinski in 06-07.Edit: No we didn't.
ottawasenators,lxt31vb,2024-11-18 14:51:12,Nope he was gone after 05-06.
ottawasenators,lxtiguy,2024-11-18 16:09:22,Hmm for some reason my brain inserted him intot he Stanley Cup Finals. I think I had him mixed up with Dean McAmmond.
ottawasenators,lxspvja,2024-11-18 13:45:09,Reach out to the org if you haven't or just message sens on X
ottawasenators,lxt2irf,2024-11-18 14:48:31,Sent a PM
ottawasenators,lxstmsa,2024-11-18 14:03:51,Ooh will do thanks for tip!
ottawasenators,lxsos18,2024-11-18 13:39:37,Ya im curious to see how they respond to that bullshit game. I’m way less afraid of the oilers than I was last year they’ve got brutal goaltending and Bouchard is the most ridiculousy lazy defender in the league. All the shit I gave Chabby last year for lazy plays nothing he did came close to what Bouchard’s been doing
ottawasenators,lxssevm,2024-11-18 13:57:43,The NHL is hard.
ottawasenators,lxsqaeh,2024-11-18 13:47:14,That was nuts hahaha couldn't believe it.  Chabby's been looking great this season so far really good sign.  Now we gotta get Sanderson-Zub rollin'...
ottawasenators,lxsykgv,2024-11-18 14:28:33,Oilers lost that game against the leafs because of Bouchard
ottawasenators,lxsz6h4,2024-11-18 14:31:37,Yeah it happened twice! His controller disconnected *twice* lol insane. I don’t even know how mad I’d be if that was someone on our team
ottawasenators,lxs7anr,2024-11-18 12:11:59,Well I’m sure Linus’s stats dropped like 3 or 4 expected goals from the Philly game. Hopefully he has a good game soon to combat it
ottawasenators,lxs7gbw,2024-11-18 12:12:46,God the sens are a good team. Expected goals against per game lower than both Edmonton and Colorado. Ullmark will get it back together and we’ll go on a run.
ottawasenators,lxsbunk,2024-11-18 12:34:51,Hey we aren't at the bottom!!
ottawasenators,lxsepe6,2024-11-18 12:49:01,We cannot have nice things
ottawasenators,lxszp6c,2024-11-18 14:34:14,Looking at the picture before reading the title really bummed me out
ottawasenators,lxtct9g,2024-11-18 15:41:01,Swayman and Ullmark sticking together
ottawasenators,lxsphzi,2024-11-18 13:43:15,I think Forsberg has done enough as a backup but Ullmark is costing this team points. It's insanely frustrating.
ottawasenators,lxseyvw,2024-11-18 12:50:20,Better than last like last year but not what we expected either. But Ullmark knows it and I have confidence he’ll bounce back.
ottawasenators,lxsl3k6,2024-11-18 13:21:10,I know the AAV is different but would you rather have Ullmark or any of the following…- Hogberg- Gustavsson- Daccord- Talbot- KorpiI could argue Daccord perhaps but Ullmark is the more proven goalie in his prime. Let man cook for 30-40 starts and then we assess. Guy needs to play better but give him some games to figure it out.
ottawasenators,lxtknso,2024-11-18 16:20:21,That Swayman guy is a bigger bum too it seems. /sRelax. Let him get some more games in.
ottawasenators,lxsfckd,2024-11-18 12:52:13,brutal
ottawasenators,lxsbtk5,2024-11-18 12:34:41,Hope so.. Ullmark is 3rd worst in low danger unblocked shot attempts save % above expected. That *should* be easy to fix/improve.
ottawasenators,lxsgyfy,2024-11-18 13:00:13,Ya before the Philly game he had a GSAx of -0.5 so roughly average so far.The Philly game knocked him from middle of the pack to near the basement lol.
ottawasenators,lxs8fhj,2024-11-18 12:17:40,I mean there expected goals for are also lower then Montreal Anaheim Utah Philly and San Jose…they may be underperforming their expected goals against but they are also over performing their expected goals for.
ottawasenators,lxshbd6,2024-11-18 13:02:03,Yeah I’m sure last week was a little bit of a roller coaster between the shutout and the Philly game. We are still just a month into the season so it has a lot of time to balance out
ottawasenators,lxsicty,2024-11-18 13:07:19,xGF isn’t the most accurate when teams have played different amount of games. Teams that play more will naturally have more xGF just based on that.Using xGF/60 (taking out games played) the Sens are 15th so nothing crazy but all right. Before the Canes game they were around the 10 spot.In terms of over performing their xGF at 5v5 they are -2.1 so they’ve actually been a bit unlucky at 5v5 finishing.
ottawasenators,lxsn941,2024-11-18 13:31:56,On the pp they are +7.15 xgf… so sure they are slightly underperforming their 5v5 gf but they are vastly over performing at 5v4. In all situations they have a +6.5 xgf.
ottawasenators,lxs5myh,2024-11-18 12:03:30,3 of the top 6 look familiar
ottawasenators,lxs7xg5,2024-11-18 12:15:10,Be proud the path to the Vezina is laid through an egg of a season in Ottawa
ottawasenators,lxsatke,2024-11-18 12:29:41,The fact 3 of the top 6 are former sens goalie hurts quite a bit but I'm confident that Ullmark will find his grove
ottawasenators,lxs99hg,2024-11-18 12:21:53,Losing Joey will always be a sore spot for me.
ottawasenators,lxs5lmp,2024-11-18 12:03:19,Yes we are a goalie graveyard we know 
ottawasenators,lxs8trl,2024-11-18 12:19:41,Hilarious.
ottawasenators,lxsfjiq,2024-11-18 12:53:12,For anyone curious Forsberg is 27th and Ullmak is 62nd.
ottawasenators,lxsefvs,2024-11-18 12:47:43,I fear the Gustavsson - Talbot trade may be another one that haunts us. I could see it being as impactful as the Zibanejad trade
ottawasenators,lxsn06q,2024-11-18 13:30:41,
ottawasenators,lxsu0kl,2024-11-18 14:05:47,"Lol we keep ""looking for goalies...."""
ottawasenators,lxsewkn,2024-11-18 12:50:01,Pain
ottawasenators,lxsg6vi,2024-11-18 12:56:25,It’s such a powerful stat evidenced by those a little further down - Hellebuyck Vasy Shesterkin they're all there.
ottawasenators,lxshpjj,2024-11-18 13:04:03,I miss Joey :(
ottawasenators,lxsj99i,2024-11-18 13:11:55,At least Korpi isn't up there
ottawasenators,lxsefqx,2024-11-18 12:47:42,Talbot has started well with every team including us before completely imploding later in the season ngl. Daccord and Gustavsson seemed to have found their stride though...
ottawasenators,lxsg8ju,2024-11-18 12:56:38,proud of Dac and Gus I dont care what any number says Cam Talbot is a horrible goalie
ottawasenators,lxsdxyu,2024-11-18 12:45:15,If it makes anyone feel better the top 4 are goalies from teams not currently in a Playoff position.
ottawasenators,lxtwu4a,2024-11-18 17:23:00,Really raises the question of whether it's our system or our goaltending coaches that are the problem.
ottawasenators,lxsfhge,2024-11-18 12:52:54,is that good
ottawasenators,lxsce30,2024-11-18 12:37:33,yep I didn't understand choosing Gus over him his personality screamed resilience and stability
ottawasenators,lxsgc48,2024-11-18 12:57:08,We are unironically elite at draftingacquiring and developing goalies just never for us
ottawasenators,lxssh7l,2024-11-18 13:58:02,Forsberg is tied with Korpisalo lmao. For some crazy reason both goalies that played for Boston last year have poor stats relative to their expected goals against while both goalies that played for Ottawa last year have a marginally positive impact.
ottawasenators,lxsi11c,2024-11-18 13:05:40,Eh I don't worry about hindsight calls. Too many variables to consider.In the moment the Talbot trade was perfectly fine.
ottawasenators,lxsiwd9,2024-11-18 13:10:05,The Gus-Talbot trade made sense at the time. The Zbad trade was criticized the second it happened
ottawasenators,lxsefer,2024-11-18 12:47:39,Maybe it would we were currently in a playoff position. I do have faith that Ullmark will get it together eventually but I'd obviously prefer that happen sooner rather than later.
ottawasenators,lxt06k7,2024-11-18 14:36:42,Yeah Gus must be doing terrible…
ottawasenators,lxt8we2,2024-11-18 15:21:06,"> In the moment the Talbot trade was perfectly fine""Rebuilding team trades top goaltending prospect for 35yo pending UFA."" It was *never* fine. It was Dorion trying to force the rebuild further than it was."

ottawasenators,lxt0n3i,2024-11-18 14:39:01,he's good of course I just think Joey's personality put him over Gus in my opinion
ottawasenators,lxtx7i1,2024-11-18 17:25:00,That was the same off-season we signed Giroux. And the narrative was that it was supposed to be the year that all the core turned the corner. And we were chasing Chychrun even then. So we weren't a rebuilding team in that moment from a management nor a marketing perspective. And sure you can say that you saw through it all as nothing but smoke and mirrors and they should have hired you in the front office - but looking back the vibe was largely it was a good move and it signaled hope for the season.
ottawasenators,lxtxrkr,2024-11-18 17:27:58,> And the narrative was that it was supposed to be the year that all the core turned the corner. Yep. *Narrative*. > So we weren't a rebuilding team in that moment from a management nor a marketing perspective.Marketing and GM desire does not dictate the position of the team.
ottawasenators,lxty4i7,2024-11-18 17:29:53,3 or 4 years of 'development' should bring an expectation of being ready to break out though.
ottawasenators,lxu03iv,2024-11-18 17:40:29,> 3 or 4 years of 'development' should bring an expectation of being ready to break out though.That wisdom holds true for *players* but goalies famously take longer to develop. By your 3-4 year metric we should have moved on from both Mads *and* Levi by now.
ottawasenators,lxu4503,2024-11-18 18:02:44,I was referring to our player core. They had been in the league long enough to that point we should have been competing for playoffs
ottawasenators,lxreopl,2024-11-18 09:38:12,Yup….my wife says stutzel? is that not a great pastry?

ottawasenators,lxtkir4,2024-11-18 16:19:39,Struuuuudelllll
ottawasenators,lxronz2,2024-11-18 10:35:04,Trying to make sense of this season so far is tough. On one hand the fancy stats and the eye test show me that the team has definitely improved. I feel like they’ve dominated many games and deserve more points than they have. On the other hand it’s the same old mistakes. Multiple goals against in a short span not being able to hold a lead goals to end a period losing to teams we should be beating not being able to comeback or get a goal with the empty net getting poor goaltending. I’m happy we’re still in the mix right now but there’s definitely some concerns still.
ottawasenators,lxs42es,2024-11-18 11:55:30,I think people are over thinking this and got over hyped. IMO this season has been great so far keeping in mind that I didn’t expect them to make the playoffs but am really really hoping for it. The reason this season is good IMO is because they are showing that they will play properly when they have someone to teach them. I love that Chabot has been given the opportunity to show what kind of player he really can be. I like the depth up front. What needs to happen is learning consistency a bit more although I do have to say that they did everything they needed to against Philly.Concerns of mine right now are Ullmark and depth on D. Ullmark having these terrible games is really the biggest one. A game here and there you expect but this is a trend. I don’t know if it’s off ice things or some kind of mental block that he needs to work through but he needs to be better for the simple reason that the team deserves to be rewarded for playing the right way.
ottawasenators,lxrqm4f,2024-11-18 10:45:33,In fact this year they have made some backs.
ottawasenators,lxrh92q,2024-11-18 09:53:24,Oof wish I didn't know that sounds like an Ottawa thing of the past to not take advantage. Hope things have changed
ottawasenators,lxrqrzu,2024-11-18 10:46:25,Edmonton is going to be tired after scoring 15 on Montreal.
ottawasenators,lxre2lw,2024-11-18 09:34:27,We're only two points back of Boston and Tampa and we have two games in hand over the Bruins one more GP than the Bolts. It would be massive for the boys if we could get all four points against two tough outs in VGK and EDM.
ottawasenators,lxrtudq,2024-11-18 11:02:42,is it really a back to back when the oilers are playing montreal first?
ottawasenators,lxrjqp5,2024-11-18 10:07:42,So we're going 0-2
ottawasenators,lxscro7,2024-11-18 12:39:24,Favourable? Not for the Sens lol
ottawasenators,lxsf3x5,2024-11-18 12:51:01,Very true at home the other team having played the night before when we have not is about as favourable as you can get for a match against Edmonton or Vegas. Hope we can capitalize.
ottawasenators,lxrnmfc,2024-11-18 10:29:21,lol
ottawasenators,lxtviyu,2024-11-18 17:15:57,If you look how they have played this year yes it is.
ottawasenators,lxpyi2l,2024-11-18 01:45:29,that sequence is pretty special too bad bath couldnt connect with that pass
ottawasenators,lxrypth,2024-11-18 11:28:18,Anyone have a clip of that crazy spinorama?
ottawasenators,lxs104t,2024-11-18 11:40:02,Anyone got a clip of his lil dipsy doodle twirl at the offensive blueline?
ottawasenators,lxsiii4,2024-11-18 13:08:08,Why can't we get goaltending like this? Also I really think we need another top 6 winger for Tim

ottawasenators,lxtb36h,2024-11-18 15:32:16,Haven’t been able to find it but it was probably even more nasty than this 
ottawasenators,lxp1jfr,2024-11-17 21:36:11,To be perfectly honest it’s easier to be optimistic about the team based on all the underlying stats the team genuinely is playing really well. The results will come.
ottawasenators,lxooiuv,2024-11-17 20:15:51,The Sens are right in the playoff mix right now.   Two points out of a WC with two games in hand on the team in the last wildcard spot and one game in hand and one point back of the two teams in front of them before the WC.   This is far closer than this team has been in 7 years and the team is legitimately been in every game this year except a couple.   If you’re feeling bad about things right now I’m thinking the only thing that would make you feel better is to have the Jets record…
ottawasenators,lxp3mpl,2024-11-17 21:49:03,I’m positive about our chances at playoffs but I wouldn’t be surprised if we go below .500 after Tuesday. It’s the Oilers. The schedule has been pretty difficult to start but there will be stretches where points come easier.I’m not exactly thrilled at the record right now but there are games in hand and they’re sitting in a workable spot.
ottawasenators,lxpdof8,2024-11-17 22:55:14,On average against any team (stanly cup champs kingdom of Ontario) YOUR… OTTAWA SENATORS win 50% or more of those games.
ottawasenators,lxrthup,2024-11-18 11:00:51,I’m way more optimistic about this team still.The underlying numbers are strong for the first time in years. Even though they had a similar record to last year the process is much better.Under DJ they were meh offensively and bad defensively. Then under Martin they were solid defensively but bad offensively. Under Green they are (depending on what model you look at) top 10 in both offence and defence.If they keep this level of play up they will win more than they lose. Plus the goaltending has been very meh to start the year. Forsberg has been close to average overall and Ullmark hasn’t found his groove yet. I fully expect Ullmark to figure it out and by seasons end to have above-average numbers.
ottawasenators,lxrta33,2024-11-18 10:59:42,I hate to break it to you but I don't think we're going to know for sure if they're a playoff team until April. Hovering around .500 will keep you in the race for most of the year.The good news is they haven't fallen out of it and don't have to worry about leapfrogging a bunch of teams to get to a playoff spot
ottawasenators,lxsxyq6,2024-11-18 14:25:32,They need to lock in and win some points
ottawasenators,lxox549,2024-11-17 21:08:51,I thought before Canes and Sens game if Sens can beat the Canes they can make it to playoffs. If they can't beat good teams they most likely will not make it
ottawasenators,lxopco7,2024-11-17 20:20:56,Just look at the ENTIRE standings . 3 points away from last place with Montreal and Columbus. That's all we need to know. None of this this team is different bullshit.
ottawasenators,lxpx8v1,2024-11-18 01:33:14,This. There is a real shift in the way we have been playing this season so far..
ottawasenators,lxr6wr0,2024-11-18 08:49:20,This is how I feel. In most years I would have lost interest by now as they're typically getting outplayed and squeaking out points. This team is dominating and not always getting the results. They could easily win a few in a row.
ottawasenators,lxrwed8,2024-11-18 11:16:11,This is what I have been saying- far different than previous years outlook. I think people need to give a little more rope for the results to come in for the hockey club
ottawasenators,lxop9kz,2024-11-17 20:20:24,[deleted]
ottawasenators,lxptjzn,2024-11-18 00:58:29,Our April is incredibly light and mostly at home. If we can stay in the mix (playing just above 0.500) until then we have a decent shot
ottawasenators,lxqscaf,2024-11-18 07:01:10,So you're saying we have a 50% chance of winning the cup!
ottawasenators,lxpcxs2,2024-11-17 22:50:06,Based on the fact that game was literally decided by external factors I'd like to see a rematch to form a proper assessment.
ottawasenators,lxqinvs,2024-11-18 05:25:34,There beating good teamsTorontoFloridaTampa
ottawasenators,lxoz7fm,2024-11-17 21:21:39,I dunno. I’m generally encouraged and think they’ve much improved in team defense. 5v5 offense is a concern. Creeping doubt with Ullmark after the Philly game but still think it’s more likely he bounces back than not.
ottawasenators,lxrskbj,2024-11-18 10:55:55,They're also 3 points away from passing Tampa for the 3rd seed in the division. Montreal has a -20 goal differential while Ottawa's is +2
ottawasenators,lxstald,2024-11-18 14:02:07,Do you ever get tired of just spouting whiney nonsense in every single thread? Get a grip or go away.
ottawasenators,lxoqyas,2024-11-17 20:30:45,Sens were dead last in the division on this date last year with eight teams to climb over for the last WC not just two.   Also did you not notice the structure style of play and overall competitiveness of the team last year?   Cuz if you don’t see a very big difference I dunno what to tell you.
ottawasenators,lxrsij6,2024-11-18 10:55:40,Either they win the cup or they don’t.Sounds like 50/50 to meThat’s how odds work right?
ottawasenators,lxpe73n,2024-11-17 22:58:50,They have tough next few games ahead will be good to assess them
ottawasenators,lxp3071,2024-11-17 21:45:13,Don’t bother with that guy. He is a negative nancy who doesn’t have many positive interactions with others in this sub
ottawasenators,lxrsrxg,2024-11-18 10:57:02,So closer to Montreal then Tampa

ottawasenators,lxsw87v,2024-11-18 14:16:50,All by design. At least i don't try to personally attack people when I'm trying to get you riled up. It's worked.
ottawasenators,lxorv2d,2024-11-17 20:36:20,By point last year they had 14. This year 17.   I’m not writing this season off at all at this point.
ottawasenators,lxrybqd,2024-11-18 11:26:17,you said goal differentialbut like 2 points vs 3 points really matters with over 60 games left LOL
ottawasenators,lxsx87o,2024-11-18 14:21:50,haha yeah you do all the time. its okay though pepsi boy its a great design to have to have the entire subreddit think your opinions are dumb.

ottawasenators,lxs22tu,2024-11-18 11:45:27,Well Tampa's goal differential is +11 so Ottawa is closer to them than Montreal in that category too.The team is 2 points out of a playoff spot and the underlying numbers show that they've performed better than their record shows. With 60 games left I don't know what all the negativity is for
ottawasenators,lxsxelc,2024-11-18 14:22:43,Welcome to last year. Same underachieving team.
ottawasenators,lxot6gp,2024-11-17 20:44:27,We also have a 4 game home-stand coming up.

ottawasenators,lxsjg7b,2024-11-18 13:12:54,You clearly aren't watching the games then. The team looks much better and the analytics support that.You sound like a casual who looks at a team's record and assumes everything based on that
ottawasenators,lxsxwrd,2024-11-18 14:25:15,Both not an problem anymore.  Speaking of someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. You.

ottawasenators,lxnjjq6,2024-11-17 16:21:03,Over under under Bath's shooting% is a little high and the PP is still running a bit too hot doubt he maintains his current pacesI think Brady slows down a little right now he's been on the ice for 28 goals on 19.5 expected. He'll probably finish above expected but not at that high of a rateI think Stü slows down a little too for the same reason as Brady but he's so involved in every play that he probably stays above a PPG
ottawasenators,lxofb8y,2024-11-17 19:21:21,Over Over and UnderI could see Stützle anywhere from 85-100+ points this year. Brady a bit lower (80-90 points) and Batherson around 65-75 points.

ottawasenators,lxnt934,2024-11-17 17:14:18,Hope everything is ok with Simmer enjoyed him on the show
ottawasenators,lxnuw44,2024-11-17 17:23:22,That's a serious bummer. Simmer has been a phenomenal addition to the show and will really be missed. Hopefully he can take some time to look after himself before coming back in a few months
ottawasenators,lxnvwke,2024-11-17 17:29:00,After his 2nd or 3rd missed show i had a feeling he wasn't just under the weather. When he fist joined the show I didn't care much for him but ended up really liking him and his questions for guests.  Gonna miss the simmer survey.
ottawasenators,lxo4ogd,2024-11-17 18:19:30,I feel really bad for Simmer. It seems like since he was let go by bell every time something positive happens for him he needs to step away. His podcast was great and he was getting positive reviews had to step away joins York and Wallace has great reviews has to step away.Hard to imagine what's going on with him mentally where when everything starts moving in a positive direction he has to step back
ottawasenators,lxnzg98,2024-11-17 17:49:10,Aw man I really liked Simmer there. They just should rotate that 3rd spot for a while
ottawasenators,lxo7loe,2024-11-17 18:36:44,A few times he'd mention his mental fortitude not being that of the elite athletes who break through. Really bummed it's lingering in the way it seems to be. Simmer seems like value added and an all around good guy. Hope the time for himself is what he needs and that his health gets back to top notch. Much peace and love in every day moving forward Simmer. Regardless of what the day brings you the world values you as you are.
ottawasenators,lxoezsm,2024-11-17 19:19:33,Oh man! Whatever the issue I can only assume it's a battle. Hang in there Simmer. You're missed any time you're away.
ottawasenators,lxoovns,2024-11-17 20:18:03,You have to feel badly for him. His career in NHL management ended when his demons got the best of him - that's something he freely acknowledges. It sucks to see him still doing battle with it because he is clearly a very sharp articulate guy who knows the game incredibly well. Hopefully he has another comeback left in him...
ottawasenators,lxoh2yt,2024-11-17 19:31:15,Gonna miss yah Simmer get well and take it easy come back strong 
ottawasenators,lxr84w1,2024-11-18 08:57:16,No one ever knows what other people go through. Everyone has demons and sometimes you have to just let it be in order to get ahead of them. Good luck Simmer I understand your situation and have been where you’re at.
ottawasenators,lxq9nvj,2024-11-18 03:44:50,I'll be honest the other two by themselves are pretty unbearable. Simmer is the only one with the actual talent for radio. I hope he's back as soon as his health allows it. 
ottawasenators,lxnqfhb,2024-11-17 16:58:40,By God that’s Bobby Ryan’s music!
ottawasenators,lxpyyw1,2024-11-18 01:50:04,Yorkie made a passing comment on one of the shows last week that made it sound like he'd gone MIA. I kinda figured then that we wouldn't be hearing from him for a while. Was hoping to be wrong.
ottawasenators,lxp2h4l,2024-11-17 21:41:57,by that description he sounds perfect for a Sens podcast
ottawasenators,lxphnos,2024-11-17 23:23:25,A positive here is that Wally and Yorkie can keep the third seat open for him. There's no real need to replace him - at most maybe have some guest hosts for a bit - and have Simmer be able to rejoin when he is ready.
ottawasenators,lxof905,2024-11-17 19:21:00,You’re absolutely right about all of that. I hope he recognizes how exceptionally gifted he is. I am consistently amazed by his ability to recall incredible details—names places comments—in his anecdotes that stem from many years ago and even in his quips about movies. CIH is really at its best when Wally York and Simmer are all feeding off each other. I am hoping in part for selfish reasons that he is able to get back to the podcast again: he is a delight to listen to.
ottawasenators,lxu6oh7,2024-11-18 18:17:21,I hope that’s the case but reading between the lines of what York said I think the door may be closed.

dallasstars,lxtoznf,2024-11-18 16:42:16,God I hope we re-sign him.
dallasstars,lxskzeb,2024-11-18 13:20:36,Should honestly be Mush-Vasi-McDavid
dallasstars,lxst2i9,2024-11-18 14:00:59,Mcdavid just got it for also hitting his 1000 point milestone.
dallasstars,lxslf7s,2024-11-18 13:22:47,Well his name is McDavid and he also scored his 1000th career point last week so...¯\\\_()_/¯
dallasstars,lxslciq,2024-11-18 13:22:25,I think a lot of it has to do with hitting 1k.
dallasstars,lxswqsn,2024-11-18 14:19:25,Good for him. Wasn’t the best player this week.
dallasstars,lxtx444,2024-11-18 17:24:30,He had 1000 points last week?!?
dallasstars,lxt0c59,2024-11-18 14:37:28,Well... he's the best player every week
dallasstars,lxtjxgc,2024-11-18 16:16:40,But. Not. This. Week.

dallasstars,lxsz4xd,2024-11-18 14:31:24,Mush getting 2nd Star of the week besides him having 1 more goal/point than McDavid is prime example of the Canadian bias/McNugget meat riding. He did all that after taking a puck to the face

dallasstars,lxs7m9d,2024-11-18 12:13:35,I’m a bears fan we both need this win lol.
dallasstars,lxu9n1l,2024-11-18 18:34:31,I'd like one from Dutchy in the first two minutes of the game. That was a good thing he had going.
dallasstars,lxtgf2u,2024-11-18 15:59:02,I have to give him credit. Jamie got his ass kicked but he didn't complain. Didn't whine and skates off under his own power. He stood up for his guy. He is the captain.
dallasstars,lxtg5ay,2024-11-18 15:57:41,That man looks like he's part of a baseball. 20 stitches they said? This is a real tough guy. And while McDavid is Canadian so is Mason Marchment right? I think this is more of an example of somebody on the Dallas team being disrespected like Dallas is always disrespected. They are fervently hope that Edmonton and Calgary will do well. They practically weep in begging for Toronto to do well. The hockey press can lathe my balls.
dallasstars,lxrxyyh,2024-11-18 11:24:26,nils he’s been doing so good
dallasstars,lxtgd3d,2024-11-18 15:58:46,Second vote for Lundkvist!
dallasstars,lxscljn,2024-11-18 12:38:34,Mike Heiska posted on Twitter that he is. Otherwise no changes since last time
dallasstars,lxsbk8p,2024-11-18 12:33:24,Says he’s starting on espn fantasy

dallasstars,lxstwsk,2024-11-18 14:05:15,I grew up in Chicago. Which oddly enough made me dislike the Bears. But yesterday was brutal and seeing the Packers win is always lame.
dallasstars,lxu5e27,2024-11-18 18:09:55,The Captain did good.  Everyone knows Zads is a lover not a fighter.  Zads would always comfort Stransky when a fight would break out in AHL.  My Captain!
dallasstars,lxtlent,2024-11-18 16:24:05,Yeah Mush is from Ontario I believe. By Canadian bias i mainly meant the teams themselves and not the individual players although it seems like they treat McDavid like some god in the same way NFL treats Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs as a whole.At the same time it always seems the national sports networks have it out for Dallas. I don't know if Jerry Jones is such a bad GM he puts a bad taste in everyone's mouth for the city of Dallas as a whole considering the Rangers don't get much love in the MLB either or if a lot of people still see Dallas as not being a hockey town which is moronic to say.Screw the national guys. All I need is Razor Josh Brian and Sevvy
dallasstars,lxu9g03,2024-11-18 18:33:22,>The hockey press can lathe my balls.I'm 1000% certain you don't want your balls lathed. Laved maybe but definitely not lathed.
dallasstars,lxseewu,2024-11-18 12:47:35,yep thanks!
dallasstars,lxseh20,2024-11-18 12:47:52,yep thanks!
dallasstars,lxrtpkr,2024-11-18 11:02:00,How about 12/14 vs STL?
dallasstars,lxs9581,2024-11-18 12:21:17,I unfortunately don’t have that game!
dallasstars,lxsuger,2024-11-18 14:07:59,Thx
dallasstars,lxoc8hh,2024-11-17 19:03:45,He will get there stats always find a way to even out by the end of the year. Really says something that we are 11-5-0 and Johnston-Robo-Hintz really aren't even clicking yet
dallasstars,lxoc0b7,2024-11-17 19:02:26,I don't think we needed a chart to tell us this; we could see it with our own stupid eyeballs on a nightly basis but there you have it. And this would be much more the topic of conversation if the Stars weren't off to a pretty good start this season but winning tends to cover up underperforming players. Believe it or not though this isn't the worst chart to be on. He's getting/creating the chances; he's just not putting them away and Mattisas Janmark Wyatt Johnston is not. Wyatt is a proven quality finisher. Expect these numbers to regress and Johnston to start racking up the goals.
dallasstars,lxp2gn7,2024-11-17 21:41:52,Wyatt will figure it out. I’d love to see stats for an almost all season contributor that isn’t generational.
dallasstars,lxp3u5y,2024-11-17 21:50:20,We are 1/8th into the season and he's young when mental game is the hardest plus we've made significant line changes this season. Let's at least give him 25 games or so to settle in.
dallasstars,lxppy5a,2024-11-18 00:26:48,He really is DeColdest Toevadoit
dallasstars,lxsewxd,2024-11-18 12:50:04,I am not too worried.  I think the scoring will come in time he has had some good chances he just is not finishing.  He has turned it up in the playoffs so that is when we will really need him.
dallasstars,lxoo7mf,2024-11-17 20:13:57,I’m a little concerned but he seemed to heat up towards the end of last year.
dallasstars,lxoqo2i,2024-11-17 20:29:00,They call it a market correction.
dallasstars,lxps1cs,2024-11-18 00:44:52,That’s because they aren’t playing together. Daddy is for some reason on the top line and Wyatt is with Stank and Jamie.
dallasstars,lxoiktz,2024-11-17 19:40:02,They've barely played together. It's a long season and Stars are steadily improving various aspects of their game. Biggest concern is the PP at the moment.
dallasstars,lxrak4n,2024-11-18 09:12:48,Robo and Hintz are barely generating chances that doesn’t always lead to regression. Wyatt is generating offense that isn’t ending in goals Robo and Hintz are not generating offense.
dallasstars,lxqkve6,2024-11-18 05:49:11,My eye sight told me that the Benn-Johnston-Dadonov line was horrific and Deboer made a mistake sticking Wyatt on a line that he went 18+ games without scoring a goal with last season. My eye sight also told me that it’s difficult for a player to get into rhythm when they’re playing with 7-8 different guys just within the first few weeks of the season. With some continuity hopefully he can start to get into a rhythm. We shall see though.
dallasstars,lxrcel4,2024-11-18 09:24:16,had to go and call out janmark! lolol. i always felt like this. oh hes on the ice. hell do okay and try but i know he isnt scoring... johnston has some time i hope it picks up for him!
dallasstars,lxqkfs1,2024-11-18 05:44:35,Glad someone mentioned it. I don’t think the line changes have helped. More stability the past 4 or so games but before that he was dealing with a revolving door which I feel likely affected his scoring.
dallasstars,lxob4gf,2024-11-17 18:57:17,Underrated aspect of Victory+ is expanding the market to Louisiana Oklahoma and Arkansas. I think the fandom will continue to grow in those states and Texas over the next few years.
dallasstars,lxo8z2x,2024-11-17 18:44:41,Husband and I are in Baton Rouge - aiyeeeee VGK Avalanche and Oilers will be top tier rivalries. Be loud. Wear green. Go Stars.
dallasstars,lxo6kiz,2024-11-17 18:30:34,Lake Charles Louisiana right here. Geaux Stars.
dallasstars,lxomjw1,2024-11-17 20:03:50,Born and raised in Houma Louisiana. Moved to Colorado 6 years ago. Been a fan since 97ish? I like to think I converted a few people thru the years. I’d lure them over with promises of beer and bbq and once they had a plate… oh look! Stars are on!
dallasstars,lxodgg8,2024-11-17 19:10:45,Yessir. Geaux Stars and Geaux Tigers!!
dallasstars,lxo8e5v,2024-11-17 18:41:19,a kid at my school used to live in Louisiana but moved to dallas just so they could go to stars games i appreciate that loyalty
dallasstars,lxokqsa,2024-11-17 19:52:55,From Shreveport here been a Stars fan since the 97-98 season when the Mudbugs came to town and introduced me to hockey. I can say there is quite a few Stars fans this way. I even have a decent sized group that gets together and watch the games during playoffs together. I ran into a guy just today at the grocery store that stopped me because he saw my Stars hat and said he’s headed to the game tomorrow. So I would say there is a bunch of Stars fans in Louisiana!
dallasstars,lxoaknr,2024-11-17 18:54:03,Welcome aboard. And I agree. +1 for Golden Knights Avs and Oilers rivals
dallasstars,lxoend2,2024-11-17 19:17:37,Some 25 years age I sold tickets for the Shreveport/Bossier MudBugs echl hockey  team. And at that time became interested in my closets NHL team. Luck for me at the time I lived in East Texas.
dallasstars,lxofb4y,2024-11-17 19:21:20,living in dallas now so it’s not quite the same but i’m from baton rouge originally and love to see other hockey fans from the boot. geaux stars!
dallasstars,lxovdvu,2024-11-17 20:57:57,Whole bunch in the Shreveport area….also a lot of Predator fans too. Mudbugs had an affiliation with Nashville for a short amount of time.
dallasstars,lxohmd2,2024-11-17 19:34:24,It all started with my beloved ice pirates. Now a stars fan for life.
dallasstars,lxpkknz,2024-11-17 23:44:31,New Orleans here. There are tens of us!
dallasstars,lxpo5m5,2024-11-18 00:12:00,I'm from Lafayette but I've lived in the Dallas area for over 25 years. We started watching hockey when the ECHL Ice Gators were in Lafayette.
dallasstars,lxpx0ua,2024-11-18 01:31:04,I don't know about a lot. But I'm one.
dallasstars,lxoed41,2024-11-17 19:16:03,We got a good rivalry with Minnesota here recently because the “north stars” moved to Dallas back in early 90’s and they had to add the expansion team (wild) so their is bad blood cause we’re so much better than those wanna be Canadians. Avs is a big rival as we’ve had western conference showdowns back in the Modano/zubov/hull days (9900 etc) Vegas Anaheim Vancouver oilers are other good rivals
dallasstars,lxol0ku,2024-11-17 19:54:33,Got into hockey with the New Orleans Brass and when I moved to Dallas it was an easy team to go with. ( Also the only Dallas team I will never root against)
dallasstars,lxp7k0d,2024-11-17 22:14:09,Shreveport here first NHL game was actually the Blues but I loved it so much I went to a Stars game and got hooked since they’re closer
dallasstars,lxppxtf,2024-11-18 00:26:44,Fan from Shreveport here. I drive over for about 10 home games a year and watch the rest on Victory+! Welcome!
dallasstars,lxopl5z,2024-11-17 20:22:23,Live in SC now originally from Lake Charles LA.  Been a Stars fan since I was introduced to hockey as a child.
dallasstars,lxpcpry,2024-11-17 22:48:35,We get a lot of hockey parents traveling to North Texas from Oklahoma and Louisiana for tournaments travel hockey and high school hockey.  That being said it makes sense that Oklahoma people and Louisiana people would gravitate to the Stars.
dallasstars,lxocrlc,2024-11-17 19:06:46,100%They killed it with this app
dallasstars,lxojxjm,2024-11-17 19:48:03,It’s wasn’t so much a problem if I traveled to Oklahoma for work but you hit Arkansas and you got Blues games on the Fox Sports/Bally RSN. It’s a baller move for sure.
dallasstars,lxo9akq,2024-11-17 18:46:33,Going to a few Zydeco games is what got me hooked
dallasstars,lxokwpr,2024-11-17 19:53:55,Can’t wait to go to the Avs game next week with my dad. First Stars game! Lived in DFW just over a year.
dallasstars,lxpqwom,2024-11-18 00:34:58,I’m in exactly the same boat as you. Born in Shreveport in the late 80s
dallasstars,lxr88zm,2024-11-18 08:57:59,Dallas transplant to the area... Every Mudbugs game I have been to usually has at least 1-2 Stars jerseys in the crowd
dallasstars,lxom26u,2024-11-17 20:00:52,The hockey team in my home city (Corpus Christi Ice Rays) regularly plays the Mudbugs! Also I kind of want a Mudbugs jersey - the angry little hockey playing crawfish is amazing.
dallasstars,lxoqrez,2024-11-17 20:29:35,My man!
dallasstars,lxrtlgc,2024-11-18 11:01:23,“There are Dozens of us! Dozens!”
dallasstars,lxp6xp4,2024-11-17 22:10:08,And lately the Preds... not sure why but post Winter Classic I've developed a rival hate towards them.
dallasstars,lxoqcgn,2024-11-17 20:27:02,I used to go to Brass games as a kid I wish they never folded was a blast and had fantastic jerseys
dallasstars,lxotb4l,2024-11-17 20:45:13,Yeah that was my thought. Lots of Blues fans to poach in Arky.
dallasstars,lxpkqzf,2024-11-17 23:45:51,I'm from cc. Do the ice rays do anything more than fight these days? Haha
dallasstars,lxp7gn0,2024-11-17 22:13:32,Nah I feel that. Especially cause they’ve been so ass but somehow everytime we play them they turn into world beaters when we need the divisional points 
dallasstars,lxtrggi,2024-11-18 16:54:43,They actually have a winning record this season (13-4-0) and are currently second in their division!But it definitely feels so weird for them to win games so often. Like I keep being surprised when I go to their games and they're actually good 
dallasstars,lxo5e6u,2024-11-17 18:23:41,I sure hope not. They seem to be pretty popular.
dallasstars,lxozipw,2024-11-17 21:23:35,I’ve grown to love the skylines. But I wish we’d move to all black all green and our current away. And the use the combos in between.
dallasstars,lxqszjo,2024-11-18 07:06:45,Fine by me. Id rather wish they played with Reverse Retro 2. it’s criminal that such a beautiful jersey won’t be used anymore.
dallasstars,lxocqci,2024-11-17 19:06:34,I think it’s about time for a New Jersey 
dallasstars,lxqv7zi,2024-11-18 07:25:30,I don't think they're out of the picture I think fanatics has enough to contend with this year.  I think 3rd jerseys will make a return in the next year.
dallasstars,lxspb66,2024-11-18 13:42:18,I love the blackouts and really want to get one at some point
dallasstars,lxp12jr,2024-11-17 21:33:16,Probably… It’s sad but they need to have the consumers (you and I) transfer money from our account to the stars account with the purchase of the “new thing”. It’s easy money for them and keeps us spending.
dallasstars,lxoz6e7,2024-11-17 21:21:28,I don’t like New Jersey so maybe a new one is in order.
dallasstars,lxsphue,2024-11-18 13:43:14,Isn’t that what it’s all about something new something to spend money on
dallasstars,lxmig8r,2024-11-17 13:03:44,I would love for them to wear the North Stars colors only for games against the Wild. Both a home and away. 
dallasstars,lxmicxi,2024-11-17 13:03:14,I believe that they own the rights to the MNS colors and logos but we just don’t use them. the mild use them becuase they are butthurt that a team left the “state of hockey” to play in Dallas and that very team has been infinitely more successful that they will ever be
dallasstars,lxmnbb5,2024-11-17 13:29:48,I’d heard that a big reason is because Tom Gaglardi hates the colors and that includes the Stars retro colors with gold.
dallasstars,lxmi0a1,2024-11-17 13:01:21,I had this same thought last night including the Titans/Oilers example.
dallasstars,lxnc7oy,2024-11-17 15:42:29,It’s not that they CAN’T it’s that the franchise WON’T. Gagliardi has been set on creating his own brand of the Stars which is why there is no gold in the current color scheme.
dallasstars,lxmpyqi,2024-11-17 13:43:25,Other unpopular opinion I think the colors are awful and I’m really glad we don’t use them 
dallasstars,lxnre34,2024-11-17 17:04:00,https://preview.redd.it/jqeelrqfbj1e1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=292119a7e15543da8687ded329f15d8c8c8c28aaRalph Strangis is a traitor. 
dallasstars,lxmx6zb,2024-11-17 14:21:05,Yes.  I hate the wild doing that.  Those are ours.  Get your own.  We should wear them strictly against MN until they get the hint.
dallasstars,lxncd9x,2024-11-17 15:43:21,Yep butt hurt but didn’t bother to support their own team when they had them. Tragic.
dallasstars,lxoasbc,2024-11-17 18:55:19,Conjecture aside;We almost did.2011-2012 almost saw a third jersey that was Kelly green. It had  D instead of an N but it was scrapped because of the bankruptcy.When Gagliardi bought the team he wanted a rebrand to get away from the bankruptcy-affiliated branding. The team almost went blue but in the waning hours Modano lobbied hard to stay green so we got the victory green.
dallasstars,lxn6ntk,2024-11-17 15:12:32,I’m glad our Adidas retro jerseys paid tribute to the Dallas teams but would be a cool alternate eventually one year
dallasstars,lxozy5f,2024-11-17 21:26:12,Minnesota like a crazy ex who wears what they think used to be your favorite dress of hers to your son’s graduation. Even though it’s 20 years out of style and forgot you bought it for her on her birthday.
dallasstars,lxn6fjn,2024-11-17 15:11:18,Because Subway eat fresh!![gif](giphy|O5LL7nIV5PQsshKzid)
dallasstars,lxp17fu,2024-11-17 21:34:08,You should go post this in the wild sub group 
dallasstars,lxp17ok,2024-11-17 21:34:10,IMO the Stars and Wild should both have the right to the colors. Stars have the legal right but the memories belong to Minnesota. I wish we would use the colors especially since it would piss off the Wild fans.
dallasstars,lxo9ixr,2024-11-17 18:47:56,Most Stars fans don’t actually care that much  about the North Stars history and colors. Sure it’s neat and all but I wouldn’t be overly upset if we let the Wild have it back. I feel as if most Stars fans only pretend to care about it just to piss off Minnesota fans. Which is really funny and we should keep doing it.
dallasstars,lxn0k8y,2024-11-17 14:39:11,We did keep the gold around for a while as something of a transition phase—remember the 90’s logo.  But we’re not the North Stars anymore we’re the Dallas Stars. I think dumping the Minnesota colors to develop a new club identity was a good move.  That and I think the Green black and white is a better color combo.  I didn’t like the skyline green at first but that one is starting to grow on me.
dallasstars,lxqawl5,2024-11-18 03:58:48,Don’t understand the “it’s not our history” comments. Dallas would have likely literally never had Mo if it wasn’t for the North Stars move. Felt very odd/slightly wrong to me to see Faber rockin his #7 in those colors. So many other franchises in the league pay kudos to their former location but for some reason we likely never will. Not to mention it would likely be a nice revenue generator
dallasstars,lxmtazn,2024-11-17 14:00:49,Let em have it they have so little
dallasstars,lxmwn6o,2024-11-17 14:18:12,Ehhh...... Hard pass.
dallasstars,lxnteou,2024-11-17 17:15:10,The stars refuse to do any good jerseys
dallasstars,lxmjjm2,2024-11-17 13:09:41,Unpopular opinion but that’s MN’s history not ours regardless of all the franchise records and everything officially belonging to Dallas. We should continue to make our own history and traditions. I do love the colors though.
dallasstars,lxomm46,2024-11-17 20:04:12,We should have gone blue when arriving in Dallas. We’d have all four DfW pro teams Blue.
dallasstars,lxoonyz,2024-11-17 20:16:44,Stars fans being mad about this is so petty.
dallasstars,lxmqwtb,2024-11-17 13:48:21,As a Stars fan who lives in MN. I would get those things framed 
dallasstars,lxmu034,2024-11-17 14:04:26,The chaos. It would be glorious. 
dallasstars,lxnn910,2024-11-17 16:41:18,That would be a hilarious troll. In fact we could go super hard and just straight up wear the N logo jerseys kinda like when the Kansas City Chiefs wear their Dallas Texans helmets with the state of Texas on them so it wouldn’t be unprecedented in sports to just go full retro for special occasions
dallasstars,lxp54jm,2024-11-17 21:58:29,I want this so much
dallasstars,lxmr0vv,2024-11-17 13:48:56,They had like 51% capacity a couple years before the move. So sour 
dallasstars,lxnlmx3,2024-11-17 16:32:26,The NHL owns the rights to them but the Dallas Stars bosses have never opted to use them for whatever reason which I think is dumb bc it's part of the teams history. The retired NStars jersey numbers hang in AAC so why not honor that part of their past as well  Rather than letting the Wild lay claim to a history that is not the Wild wearing N Stars throwbacks in the alumni game several years ago complete with former N Stars players 
dallasstars,lxn5cvz,2024-11-17 15:05:26,If the Stars moved to Saskatoon because a shitheel owner made a dime off the transfer you’d be “butthurt” too.
dallasstars,lxmqdi7,2024-11-17 13:45:33,there was a interview with him the day they unveiled the new jerseys to what we have now and made a stupid joke that stars in the sky look more silver than gold. Truth is if the stars changed back to their original logo people would love them more than his ninja star logo idea we currently have
dallasstars,lxsnyly,2024-11-18 13:35:30,He’s wrong. The gold is bad ass.
dallasstars,lxmqjnp,2024-11-17 13:46:26,100% agree. They look awful on the ice today. Maybe back when games were televised on potatoes the bright colors worked but the yellow/green combo looks so bad to me
dallasstars,lxmyr3t,2024-11-17 14:29:25,Same I saw them yesterday and was like oof those jerseys are hideoussss
dallasstars,lxn3lx1,2024-11-17 14:55:51,Dang I think they look awesome. But I wouldn’t want to go back to that. We’ve moved on let MN have them. (Colors not logo/name)
dallasstars,lxqww2g,2024-11-18 07:38:49,We've known this for a bit.
dallasstars,lxqaest,2024-11-18 03:53:19,This. Loved those. I like the neon blackout enough but would love them to be replaced w the dark retro sweater. So perfect
dallasstars,lxqx8d8,2024-11-18 07:41:27,That's why it's a retro jersey.  No one is wanting to see bright green and gold 70 games a year (allowing the rest for alternates.)  People want to see it on twice a year when we wear throwback jerseys.
dallasstars,lxqxebr,2024-11-18 07:42:43,That's what happens when you piss away your franchise beg for 30 years and then try to puss away your new franchise.
dallasstars,lxmudev,2024-11-17 14:06:21,Exactly I never understand the argument of people saying Dallas should use North Stars colours.. like what. No one in Dallas gives a shit about that.. would Winnipeg start wearing Thrashers stuff all of a sudden? Its cringe.
dallasstars,lxmmyla,2024-11-17 13:27:56,agree 100%
dallasstars,lxmoazz,2024-11-17 13:34:59,As a Baltimore Colts fan 100% agree. When a team moves the history of that team should stay behind. If you want the history of the team don’t move.
dallasstars,lxn786j,2024-11-17 15:15:36,Agreed. When the Stars first moved I thought it was great that they recognized the franchise history team records retired numbers etc. Now that they've been in Dallas all these years give Minnesota their history back. Do what the NFL did with the Browns and what the NHL will eventually do with the Coyotes.
dallasstars,lxp79x1,2024-11-17 22:12:19,"Nah. There's a poetic romanticism in knowing ""The Stars at night shine big and bright"" means more cause we love this hockey team."
dallasstars,lxn70t8,2024-11-17 15:14:30,Wild would choose same colors. And it’d be like every club game in CHEL.
dallasstars,lxnjlhb,2024-11-17 16:21:18,Womp womp should have supported your team
dallasstars,lxmrc7n,2024-11-17 13:50:35,Our current logo isn’t even bad though. Sure I prefer the other one but the current one is great with the current colors.
dallasstars,lxmryww,2024-11-17 13:53:57,It’d be great to have a few more interesting choices here and there - retro and other creative ones.
dallasstars,lxndzck,2024-11-17 15:51:39,I really like the current logo and uniform but I *love* the old star motif
dallasstars,lxqxiy1,2024-11-18 07:43:43,No one wants them for our actual colors.  People want them for twice a year on retro nights.
dallasstars,lxr46d0,2024-11-18 08:31:18,My wife and I wear the blackout 90% of the time even though we have almost every Stars jersey
dallasstars,lxn43h7,2024-11-17 14:58:33,The entity moved so should the history. Logo and name included. Colors aren’t really unique.
dallasstars,lxqxeyz,2024-11-18 07:42:52,No issues with the name. I just wish we would have changed our major color to blue when we arrived in a Dallas. My bet is that absolutely would have but Tampa Bay had arrived in the scene the year before with the perfect “Cowboy” blue. We should have Tampa’s colors and it makes me hate them even more.
dallasstars,lxoyxrg,2024-11-17 21:19:59,Yeah I don’t think I’m alone in saying I’ve been a big fan of the new sweaters. Don’t get me wrong the 90s and early 00s jerseys are sweet but after going through the few years where they were just one color with secondary color piping and the word “Dallas” on the front the current kits are infinitely better
dallasstars,lxmsouy,2024-11-17 13:57:38,I agree I'm still not happy the owner didn't do anything for the team's 30th anniversary they could have had our original jerseys worn then
dallasstars,lxszyne,2024-11-18 14:35:35,I still think the Winter Classic jerseys should be full time alternates. One of my favorite sweaters ever.
dallasstars,lxra9zo,2024-11-18 09:11:00,For a sky background... that wouldn't be bad... almost like the FC Dallas Stars at Night kit
dallasstars,lxmbhlf,2024-11-17 12:25:16,He's exactly the type of guy who eventually becomes a captain.  It'll depend on timing though.  Where he is in his development and in the locker room when Benn eventually gives up the C.  Stank's still years away from getting any sort of letter let alone a C.I could also see Heiskanen putting the C on as well timing dependent.
dallasstars,lxmbi6z,2024-11-17 12:25:21,The thing about the Stars is they have a great pool of players to pick from for the next captain. That’s what happens when you draft really well. Razor and Heika have talked about the subject of the next captain a couple of times on the Podman Rush and they’ve talked about everyone from Stankoven to Robertson as a possibility. General consensus by them in the past has been Miro will likely be asked if he wants it first before they pivot to Johnston. That’s not to say though Logan wouldn’t be a possibility though. It’s important to remember also Jim Nill is adamant to sign Benn to a new contract so theoretically this isn’t really an issue until like the 27-28 season or even later if Jamie is still productive.
dallasstars,lxmyngt,2024-11-17 14:28:51,Benn is going to play until 65 just to piss off Red Wings fans.
dallasstars,lxmfmf7,2024-11-17 12:48:14,I think if he commits to the franchise and becomes a veteran there is a good chance he can wear it.I’d say at some point he’s guaranteed to wear an A.
dallasstars,lxmikbo,2024-11-17 13:04:21,There are some good young guys I could see being locker room leaders but its hard for me to see anyone being more deserving of it than Heiskanen(as long as he specifically doesn't want to defer that responsibility.)Heiskanen would be my pick though if I was in the position to choose when the time comes for Benn to pass it on so I'm biased. But on top of the fact that he seems like a good leader(already the unofficial captain of the defense in my mind) I like the idea of giving it to our best defenseman who's on the ice all the time and having a bit of a subtle message that defense is the first responsibility of the team.
dallasstars,lxme1j9,2024-11-17 12:39:27,Stank gets an A in a couple years. Way too early for him to wear any letter. Next Cap is either Heiskanen or Lindell. 
dallasstars,lxmb9hf,2024-11-17 12:24:02,I’m curious if once Benn retires they will leave the “C” open for a season and see who steps up.
dallasstars,lxml1bm,2024-11-17 13:17:42,I love to watch Stankoven play.
dallasstars,lxmvpsd,2024-11-17 14:13:19,If he continues to develop the way he is and if everything lines up when it's time for him to get a letter.... I think he has the possibility of being a great captain. But only time will tell.
dallasstars,lxnjo07,2024-11-17 16:21:41,At this point you could speculate that any number of youngsters could wear the C when it’s time when Jamie steps down or retires.  Last season everyone was saying Robo or Miro now here comes the Stankhoven speculation. I’ll say this he plays like you want your captain to play…zero quit max effort every shift.  Leads by example a lot like Morrow did when he wore the C. Maybe Robo could learn a few things from the kid. Last night JR was very slow on a change coasting to the bench behind the play while the player rolling for him just waited and waited (and waited dude even coasts slowly) to jump on.  I used to get dog cussed for that kind of effort :). I love seeing Logan ferociously forecheck and backcheck he does NOT quit ever.  His flip pass to himself was also pretty amazing.  Almost assisted on his own goal.
dallasstars,lxmgm2y,2024-11-17 12:53:41,As a franchise our captains are tied to a physical identity so I'd say its whoever throws hands the best.
dallasstars,lxmf2uy,2024-11-17 12:45:14,My choices would be:*Captain*• Heiskanen• Hintz• Duchene*Assistant*• Marchment• Johnston• Robertson• Stankoven
dallasstars,lxn59ff,2024-11-17 15:04:55,I’ve said it since drafting him. Johnston for the C Robo A Stank A Miro alternate Otter alternate on special games (winter classic global etc.)
dallasstars,lxn5yjb,2024-11-17 15:08:42,Miro would be my guess for the next Captain. I think Wyatt has a lot of potential too but Stanky for sure could get into the conversation too. They need to be a leader though not just a good scorer.
dallasstars,lxn7zb8,2024-11-17 15:19:43,Miro
dallasstars,lxnrfiq,2024-11-17 17:04:13,I thought Wyatt might be the next C. But I'm not counting out Logan
dallasstars,lxpkso4,2024-11-17 23:46:12,I think the Stars have a number of good players that can fill a leadership role once Benn hangs up his skates...but being a great captain is about more than what we (as fans) see on the ice. I hope whoever is next is the right guy to lead the team inside & outside the locker room.That said I do love the way Stankoven plays - fearless gritty & skilled.
dallasstars,lxrbkj7,2024-11-18 09:19:05,rookie years can be something different than playoff play and vs sophomore year as we have seen with robertson.
dallasstars,lxn3gzz,2024-11-17 14:55:05,Or Matt Duchene boys. God-fearin' and puts the fear of God into opponents. Humble modest and thankful. His face would have it I too think Logan has what it takes. But first Matty.
dallasstars,lxo1ft7,2024-11-17 18:00:34,I'm an advocate for Robo getting the C. Our next captain should be American
dallasstars,lxsoled,2024-11-18 13:38:41,Yeah with Miro wearing the A the last couple seasons I feel like he is most likely to take the C after Jamie.  That said I could definitely see Stank getting a letter in the future.  I also agree we’ve got at least a couple years before any changes happen.  I believe Jamie will re-sign at least through the final 2 years of Seguin’s contract and I wouldn’t be surprised if he plays another 4-5 years
dallasstars,lxmcg5i,2024-11-17 12:30:37,For sure and it's good to be in this position. I think stanks got youth on his side so he'd still be young once benn leaves
dallasstars,lxoj7zs,2024-11-17 19:43:54,Old Jamie Benn gonna be punching Jake Paul in the dick and smiling.
dallasstars,lxmjve5,2024-11-17 13:11:25,Personally I think Miro is going to be the next Captain and I think he will do a great job as Captain
dallasstars,lxmo1vy,2024-11-17 13:33:39,Same! I only wish I had that kind of energy when play beer league haha
dallasstars,lxnrrp8,2024-11-17 17:06:05,Yeah that's what I'm thinking puts some big pluses in his category. He's the kind of guy that gets on the ice and you know you have to play at his level
dallasstars,lxmnoda,2024-11-17 13:31:39,Disagree. Historically you’re not wrong but I don’t think our next one is gonna be much of a fighter.
dallasstars,lxmm4e1,2024-11-17 13:23:27,Isn’t it Alternate not Assistant? Or have I been doing that wrong in my head all these years lol
dallasstars,lxn3vh2,2024-11-17 14:57:19,Drat the rat has got it!
dallasstars,lxof40j,2024-11-17 19:20:13,What the fuck does being American have to do with it?
dallasstars,lxsozkd,2024-11-18 13:40:40,Lindell has had the A for 5 years Miro has had it for 4.  My guess is the C would go to Miro as he’s more likely to be on the team long term and is also the better player who plays bigger minutes.
dallasstars,lxsp39u,2024-11-18 13:41:11,After watching him flip the puck over a defenseman to himself last game I decided he’s the next jersey I buy
dallasstars,lxnyigf,2024-11-17 17:43:49,Just by his play he’s more captain material than Robertson.  It’s hard to tell who the locker room looks to besides Jamie now that Pavelski is gone.  When I saw Logan in CP I was impressed with him but thought he would struggle with the size issue.  Nope.  He reminds me of a few smaller guys like Martin St. Louis or Theo Fleury with his compete level.    Neither of those two ‘smaller’ guys ever let their size get in the way of playing hard.  Neither played small.  He’s definitely the most electric player we have right now right up there with Dutch Roope and Wyatt…whatever happens I’m sure Stanky will earn it through hard work and not just be crowned the captain just because.
dallasstars,lxnl9wc,2024-11-17 16:30:28,Mainly cuz we just don't have someone like that coming up. Bichsel is the closest among the young crop but he's a long way from earning that realistically.
dallasstars,lxmpqba,2024-11-17 13:42:14,No you’re right lol
dallasstars,lxn5i2p,2024-11-17 15:06:12,Some teams delineate differently as some teams have different alternate away/home assistants.
dallasstars,lxnsr2m,2024-11-17 17:11:30,Six one way half a dozen the other.I say: since there are both C’s and A’s that are in the active lineup/playing at the same time it should be “Assistant”…such as Benn being the captain but Seguin is also in the lineup and can *assist* filling the captain role when he is on the ice and Benn is not (such as talking to the ref)Because if it were “alternate” that would be more of along the lines being only one person gets a letter - the C until they are not in the lineup and then one of your designated “alternates” would wear the C when your normal captain is out you would literally *alternate* which player wears the C and only one player would wear it at a time. Example Benn has the captain C he wears it one game then Seguin being an Alternate will wear the C in one game then Pavelski would wear the C in one game and they would all *alternate* wearing it.
dallasstars,lxohcei,2024-11-17 19:32:47,We're an American team and the team was at its best when an American was captain (Hatcher) just my personal opinion. Also Robo is the most captain material
dallasstars,lxnlgl9,2024-11-17 16:31:29,Exactly. It’s gonna be more of a skill based leader a lot of the league has gone to. Miro Wyatt Hintz Robo etc
dallasstars,lxnuzgp,2024-11-17 17:23:53,It has to do with who’s “allowed” to talk to the refs I thought?If the captain is not on the ice when something is called the alternates are able to argue/talk with the refs.
dallasstars,lxpkv66,2024-11-17 23:46:42,Yeah an American team that likes finish players it's probably going to be Miro or Hintz
dallasstars,lxkg55w,2024-11-17 03:44:17,I mean you may as well be playing Russian roulette with Dallas players. Robo will likely bounce back and Marchment has a lower ceiling but he’s cooking rn. If it was Duchene I think that’s more of a question but I’d still be inclined to stick to Robo especially once he and Hintz get a line that clicks or they just start clicking again
dallasstars,lxk4yil,2024-11-17 01:46:15,A lady never tells

dallasstars,lxk3y7w,2024-11-17 01:36:50,It cracks me up when they wear the North Stars jerseys when they play us out of 26 seasons there only 8 had a winning regular season record and most of those were after they merged with the Barons.  The Stars have had 26 winning regular seasons since they moved to Dallas.  They have been here longer and have had great success as well.  Its like bitching at your wife because your ex girlfriend makes more money than she does.  At this point the mild just need a full rebrand or they are never going to have their own identity.

dallasstars,lxkdeh6,2024-11-17 03:14:01,So embarrassing that they wear our old team’s colors as if it’s theirs. Mild.
dallasstars,lxkk6dc,2024-11-17 04:29:13,They lost the North Stars because they abandoned them. Go watch video of the last few years. The rink was empty. You give up on your team now you wanna wear their colors after the Dallas Stars make the franchise notable. Pffffff
dallasstars,lxjn5al,2024-11-16 23:18:37,The only time is when we play them. That’s it
dallasstars,lxjnh5s,2024-11-16 23:21:05,"Met a Mild fan a few weeks ago who went full on rqbid about how the stars shouldn't have the North stars history this 100% tracks with my thoughts during that ""conversation"""
dallasstars,lxl81a6,2024-11-17 08:25:29,Stars fans only think about the Wild 4 times a year. The Wild fans think about the Stars all year long.
dallasstars,lxlzn4w,2024-11-17 11:19:54,I was a North Stars fan for years many bad years and my fandom followed the team to Dallas. When Minny got a team back I stuck with big D and have no regrets. That said I kinda like the Wild in old North Star colors. I especially like the pants with the three stars down each side. And when Dallas wins the game/series I like that too
dallasstars,lxlwzau,2024-11-17 11:05:06,They want to be is so badly they wore our throwbacks
dallasstars,lxmn7n5,2024-11-17 13:29:17,I always enjoy the extra Stars support when Minnesota fans show up wearing North Star gear. If that gear is not 30 years old the club thanks you for the revenue.
dallasstars,lxjk1at,2024-11-16 22:55:53,You do realize the problem with creating a post about the Wild that says you don't think about the Wild right?
dallasstars,lxn84s7,2024-11-17 15:20:30,i think moving a team is a horrible thing to do to a city and that the north stars history should probably belong to minnesota. however outside of one stanley cup finals appearance the north stars were a poverty franchise so that history isn’t really worth giving much of a fuck about imo. i do think it’s a shame that the wild haven’t been able to win anything but the dallas stars aren’t their general manager.
dallasstars,lxoyngd,2024-11-17 21:18:11,move em to Houston
dallasstars,lxo18i2,2024-11-17 17:59:25,MN NS were a shit franchise in a shit building for a shit owner with shit fans.They won their division twice... the two years they made it to the Stanley Cup finals they were 3rd and 4th in the division with 88 pts and 68 pts (not joking). MN fans acting like their beloved team was stolen is a complete fallacy. The North Stars were Phoenix Coyotes 1.0 and a massive headache for the NHL.Dallas was 2nd choice and they would have ended up in southern California if Disney hadn't vetoed their relocation (Ducks).My initial thought was 'fuck the North Stars; to the victor go the spoils' but then I realized that the Dallas Stars have a much deeper history at this point and aside from transition players like Modano who cares about North Stars 'colors' and 'history'? Give it to the whiny bitches.

dallasstars,lxjluv5,2024-11-16 23:09:03,Getting beat in your own barn by the team who’s jersey you have on is a new low. 
dallasstars,lxjhcjh,2024-11-16 22:37:33,You know what I didn't see against both games against Florida and against the Jets was any physicality at all it was like Dallas was being so passive and they were unwilling to hit the way Dallas has been lately this is the team that looks like they took a step up from last year and with the added size and athleticism that they now have I really like what they are doing. They just have to make sure that they continue to start games fast instead of slow sometimes.
dallasstars,lxjifoa,2024-11-16 22:44:52,Hell yeah! Great win!

dallasstars,lxjlx90,2024-11-16 23:09:33,Send Mav back to the A or play the kid more.  7 minutes a night will do nothing to kickstart him.Nils might be playing better but I strongly doubt it is a testament to the way the Stars played him last year. Let’s not make this a thing FO.Maybe they try the Robertson play and let him get hot in the A the bring him back up and play with decent line-mates.
dallasstars,lxjw44f,2024-11-17 00:29:38,Goddamn I love that we beat them while they were wearing OUR uniforms. Fuck ass franchise
dallasstars,lxl6ymx,2024-11-17 08:17:20,7 straight games the Stars have beat the Mild. It is absolute clown world stuff that they wear colors that their franchise has never been affiliated with and then get constantly beat by the franchise that they wish they were so badly.
dallasstars,lxjjtz6,2024-11-16 22:54:27,lmao that interference on jamie at the end with no call. all game just trying to keep the wild in it even though it was mostly even despite the shots.having said that robo and roope need to sit. this is just egregious how abysmal they have been when they are supposed to be your top line superstars. no excuse at this point
dallasstars,lxk7adt,2024-11-17 02:09:11,Any game where you don’t capitalise on your dominance but still come away with the win is great. Doing it against the Wild makes it that much better.
dallasstars,lxjhkb6,2024-11-16 22:39:03,Minnesota is much improved this season. They still suck though and especially Dumba.
dallasstars,lxjrdj2,2024-11-16 23:51:12,Someone gonna posts the fights pls?

dallasstars,lxjmo6j,2024-11-16 23:15:06,Best win of the season...for now!
dallasstars,lxk2x1j,2024-11-17 01:27:49,I wouldn't say it was the best played game of the season but definitely the best game contextually. First good team (in the standing at the time) we've managed to beat so far and we looked like the better team the whole way through.     Feels like that loss to the Jets was a real kick in the teeth for the boys. They've been coming out of the gates with purpose these last 3 games and are actually dominating shots on goal for once. Utilizing the point instead of forcing interior plays into a wall. Good stuff.
dallasstars,lxkitk5,2024-11-17 04:14:02,Gig em

dallasstars,lxk6qk1,2024-11-17 02:03:39,God how I wish he had scored on that backhand. Any goal would have been an epic finish but straight into the top corner would have been an all time highlight reel effort.

coyotes,lwxvy8i,2024-11-13 11:48:58,Mat Ishbia and the Suns is the ONLY way this happens. No other magical mystery group will have the chops to get anything done politically in the Valley and no we DO NOT need another arena strictly dedicated to Hockey. I have no doubt Footprint can be modified to accomodate hockey until a shared NHL/NBA facility is built after 2037.Glendale will never be feasible to support the NHL demographic
coyotes,lwxyqj5,2024-11-13 12:03:04,1) a renovation is not going to happen they just renovated footprint and won't again. Especially for obstructed view hockey. It's already one of the oldest arenas in basketball there is zero chance Ishbia wants to stay there for 20+ more years. it's bad enough the Suns are under lease till 2037 because of the last reno project another one would only extend that lease significantly. Him building a new arena is possible but we're 10 years away from that even becoming a serious conversation. 2) fat chance the bridge is burned in Glendale. Additionally the NHL wouldn't allow an expansion back into the exact same fucking situation the Coyotes were in out there.
coyotes,lwyj4xc,2024-11-13 13:45:45,Any new incarnation of the Coyotes is going to have to be new everything. Glendale isn't an option even temporarily. Any of the people connected to the team in the past likely make it a non-starter too. An arena deal will have to be 100% ironclad and it'll have to be a shared facility with the Suns. Doesn't make sense otherwise. The NHL isn't going to do hopes and prayers here anymore - and rightfully so. I will say that Sarver really screwed the Coyotes on the renovation deal but Meruelo and has band of asshats almost certainly messed things up with the Suns and City of Phoenix before then. So for all these reasons Ishbia is likely the best bet. But he's not going to do anything until talks on a new facility start ramping up in 8-10 years.
coyotes,lwy1rdf,2024-11-13 12:18:21,The new Clippers arena works because it is Basketball (and concerts) only. When you have to give space for a large hockey rink you can't build it as tight and small as what the Clippers did. So I mean I guess the Suns could build their own arena and then the Coyotes could play at FootPrint but it would need to be renovated again so you could actually see both  goals from the top. That was a big problem back in the day.
coyotes,lwzodha,2024-11-13 17:15:04,It'll all come down to whether it makes good business sense for Ishbia to put an ice plant in his new building for the Suns and that's scheduled for 2034. The location and the money would have to make sense to him and there'd have to be a desire there too.Ishbia's comparably young and the idea of a sporting dynasty (him becoming an Arizona sporting god) may seem obviously desirable to us but we have no idea what he's actually like and how genuinely interested he is right now; and by extension how genuinely interested he'll be in a half-decade when he'd need to start seriously considering this. It'd be a lot of risk to take on and he'd be in the back 9 of his life at that point and would have to be really keen.But look if the league is actually keen to get up to 40 teams...it's hard to believe (based on market size) that they wouldn't want us back as a part of that. So one has to hope that this deletion of the team was more about excising the Meruelos than it was about giving up on Arizona for good.
coyotes,lwy4nii,2024-11-13 12:32:59,I'm really bearish on us getting another team.  I think the investment risk is too great for a private entity/entities and i don't see the political environment being favorable towards ponying up the public money that'd be required to address that.Unless they find a way to make arena's cost 'only' a few hundred million bucks again i think we're SOL :(
coyotes,lxof3mp,2024-11-17 19:20:09,What about building a new arena on the Arizona Coliseum site? That building has been dormant for years and has several code violations. Plus the new ownership group can build a new arena on that site that is for hockey and basketball. I think it would be a great idea. 
coyotes,lxpfoxa,2024-11-17 23:09:24,It would have to be scenario 1 - Ishbia with a new multi-use arena for the Suns and Coyotes. That's the likeliest and probably only scenario for the return of the Coyotes.We're basically in 'Help Us Obi-Wan Kenobi...You're Our Only Hope' territory.
coyotes,lwybpio,2024-11-13 13:08:28,Ishbia is not the only way this happens I heard from ex team employees that there is another group starting to form led by someone with strong hockey ties to the valley. They are serious and capable. I hate rumors but it's not just Ishbia who can save NHL hockey here.regardless it's going to be years before anything actually starts happening no matter who is involved. strap in folks it's gonna be a while.
coyotes,lwy3bfz,2024-11-13 12:26:14,i completely agree.  and considering the suns just blew like $200M+ renovating footprint not even 5 years ago honestly i'm not optimistic.i hate being a negative nancy but i bet 2040 comes and goes without an NHL franchise here.
coyotes,lwy8prh,2024-11-13 12:53:27,1)Renovation on the Delta center recently happened and now here they are doing it again so not unheard of. 2)Eh wouldn't surprise me since conditions have changed since then and the valley will continue to grow.
coyotes,lwyv279,2024-11-13 14:45:46,Ishbia has said he’s interested in getting back. But doesn’t want to be the main guy. So unless something changes I think Ishbia is only involved financially after someone else does the heavy lifting.
coyotes,lwy8bju,2024-11-13 12:51:29,The intent was to basically point out the newness and state of the art features not an exact copy. To have the suns still playing on Footprint after this long I think a new arena would be great to see. And to be able to accommodate multiple sports beyond basketball would be huge.
coyotes,lwzlvfs,2024-11-13 17:01:52,Don't take this the wrong way but the scenario I'm imagining probably involves a group of millionaires and I worry we've seen that particular episode before.Like I just don't see a clump of millionaires or millionaires with a big blob of private equity getting an arena up when that's exactly what failed the first time around; even if they're led by someone beloved.
coyotes,lx1n3ao,2024-11-14 00:36:33,I heard about another group too. They're going to want public subsidies. They always do. Arizona residents won't cough up a penny for an arena. Especially hockey. It's 100% privately financed or forget about it.
coyotes,lwyc6yj,2024-11-13 13:10:56,Former Coyotes employees are the last people on earth I’d believe
coyotes,lwy9ydz,2024-11-13 12:59:39,fun reminder: the coyotes started their tenure in an obstructed view arena without a solid permanent plan in place. Look how that worked out for them the 1st time. The NHL will **absolutely not** make the same mistake twice here. also Gila sold their ice plant so now you need to reno at least part of that arena as well before hockey could be played there again. there will never be a NHL team back in Arizona without a brand new multi-use arena. full stop.
coyotes,lwyvtua,2024-11-13 14:49:36,Sounds like a great job for Doaner eventually
coyotes,lwzmghi,2024-11-13 17:04:58,You're not wrong. but at this point any viable option to get a team back is a good one to me 
coyotes,lx1yhck,2024-11-14 02:25:18,“The NHL will absolutely not make the same mistake twice...”    *Laughs in Atlanta*
coyotes,lwyvz8g,2024-11-13 14:50:21,Hopefully. I’m not optimistic though.
coyotes,lwznwhr,2024-11-13 17:12:36,I mean even if they breathe down Ishbia's neck enough to get him to commit for 2034 that'd work for me.
coyotes,lwit73m,2024-11-10 22:01:30,Love the plate but the frame needs to say Meruelo not Bettman.   Hate Bettman all you want but he stuck by the team through so much bullshit - any other commish would’ve moved them years ago.
coyotes,lwiuclb,2024-11-10 22:08:44,Bettman is the only reason the team didn't get relocated like 15 years ago he wasn't the problem.
coyotes,lwizab4,2024-11-10 22:39:21,This is stupid. Bettman ain’t to blame
coyotes,lwix0bp,2024-11-10 22:25:20,Agree with other posters also FTK
coyotes,lwlzmyk,2024-11-11 12:33:39,Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?

coyotes,lxpglgu,2024-11-17 23:15:53,Bettman's not to blame. Speaking of reboot...I envision the intro video for the first season of Coyotes 2.0 starting like a 90s Macintosh complete with that familiar chime...
coyotes,lwlkzav,2024-11-11 11:18:12,Someone who is going to get a ticket for covering the state with their frame.

coyotes,lw7fhm8,2024-11-09 00:08:16,Weird. The Rangers played the yotes goal song in a pre season game

coyotes,lwal15y,2024-11-09 14:22:11,If you want to re-hear it there’s a YouTube channel called “Famous Goal Horns” and he’s posted the Yotes goal horns for the last 5-6 years. Not the same obviously but hopefully it helps
coyotes,lwbr3ry,2024-11-09 18:15:50,I still howl at the tv when Utah scores  And even before they left at every sporting event I’ve ever been to when the “let’s go team-name” chant breaks out I always say let’s go ky-otes!

coyotes,lw4ff51,2024-11-08 13:42:26,It's from a fan perspective so I think it will hopefully be a good watch for any of us here
coyotes,lw5apoc,2024-11-08 16:19:32,2 hours?? You lived it.
coyotes,lwa8na8,2024-11-09 13:16:02,We want time to relive it. I too saw 2 hours and said I gotta make time for this. 28 years in 2 hours will be an emotional roller coaster
coyotes,lw3lkv2,2024-11-08 11:17:58,I hope that Kells scores 115 points this year and Utah goes on with a 10-70-2 record.
coyotes,lw3feoe,2024-11-08 10:47:51,"Clayton ""you never turn your back on family"" Keller "
coyotes,lw409mj,2024-11-08 12:28:49,Said it in another thread yesterday but the dude legitimately showed up and fought for the Yotes in AZ throughout all those public campaigns and PR nightmares. I also remember Craig Morgan reporting almost every year that Keller was one of the guys who spent a ton of time in AZ even in the offseason and led sessions and workouts here because he simply wanted to be here and was committed to the team.Of all the people you could possibly hold a grudge against for being a part of the Utah thing Keller is not one of them. Dude fought for hockey in the Valley so I’ll be a fan of his even if I’m not a fan of Utah or the NHL.
coyotes,lw3mm4f,2024-11-08 11:23:00,Keller is from St Louis so this kid knows what’s up.
coyotes,lw383ue,2024-11-08 10:11:17,Seeing him in that jersey is fucking disgusting
coyotes,lw4jgys,2024-11-08 14:02:19,Class act but god it stings seeing him in that awful Walmart brand uniform
coyotes,lw4sdfr,2024-11-08 14:46:40,Life long Keller fan now if he wasn't already!
coyotes,lw3zmfu,2024-11-08 12:25:44,Imagine going from beautiful Arizona to that shithole Utah. 
coyotes,lw5cuoe,2024-11-08 16:30:48,Those Utah jerseys are fucking ugly
coyotes,lw990nu,2024-11-09 10:01:56,I can’t and will never ever cheer for anyone in an Utah uniform. He can be a good guy it doesn’t negate he is wearing that uniform and is a member of that team. I hope they loose every game. F k anything from that state. Mormons run the show and they are the most hypocritical group of disgust there is.
coyotes,lw9cif6,2024-11-09 10:22:16,Personally I don’t wish the guy bad but I don’t want  to see an  ugly as hell Utah anything on this feed. As far as that team if they loose every game I would be thrilled
coyotes,lwc4p62,2024-11-09 19:36:32,TylerThat not a very good record they better do much better
coyotes,lw41ie5,2024-11-08 12:34:53,Dude at the top of the comments has the right idea: I hope Keller has an amazing year and Hockey Club finishes at the bottom of the standings.
coyotes,lwc4xfy,2024-11-09 19:37:55,DIDO
coyotes,lw43kgr,2024-11-08 12:44:48,I saw a lot of Keller jerseys last night at the game (and all of them were Yotes jerseys)
coyotes,lw3cp2u,2024-11-08 10:34:28,Breaks my heart that I can’t watch these guys especially Keller. Everytime I try to watch I get bummed and have to switch channels.
coyotes,lw39a7z,2024-11-08 10:17:19,Yeah….
coyotes,lwumlyr,2024-11-12 20:57:39,It’s PeeWee AA coded
coyotes,lwc4z0e,2024-11-09 19:38:11,That's the point.
coyotes,lw3ha6p,2024-11-08 10:57:00,Same. I want him to do well so bad but I cannot root for Utah.
coyotes,lw6gwdm,2024-11-08 20:16:07,I tried to follow this team to Utah but couldn't.  Just pisses me off seeing that team with Utah on their jerseys. For the first time in 30 years I'm not watching the NHL.
coyotes,lwc61in,2024-11-09 19:44:35,I followed it was tough to see the team play in UTAH. But PHX fucked up 8 mean what team get kick out of there arena. I think it was all a set up between the owner and the President for NHL. I mean who buys a team. For 465650000.00 and 2.5 years later be get 1 billion dollars. That a setup that kind of money just doesn't happen. Big profit is definitely a pay off. Do I miss the Coyotes every fucking day.
coyotes,lw2owgg,2024-11-08 08:23:21,Alex Meruelo is a piece of shit.
coyotes,lw99a3k,2024-11-09 10:03:29,So is Ryan Smith. His basketball is crappie and I cheer at every loss his hockey team has.
coyotes,lvuuz49,2024-11-07 01:18:09,I wish we could have taken Gretzky out for how badly he fucked the team.
coyotes,lvuynl4,2024-11-07 01:52:11,OEL would be the obvious choice when he retires of course but I think Vrbata would’ve been a nice fit as well. Not at all a traditional ring of honor pick for on-ice play but it would’ve been nice seeing Biz get some love for being a pretty big fan favorite out here and always repping the team when he could. Matt Shott would’ve been a wonderful addition alongside Leighton and if the NHL ever does come back here 94 & 49 should be in that ring forever.
coyotes,lvv0zxq,2024-11-07 02:14:45,Shoutout for the Bulin Wall Nikolai Khabibulin.  Maybe it's nostalgia bias but seeing him stop everything that came his way as a kid has really stuck with me.
coyotes,lvvknaf,2024-11-07 05:44:31,Mike smith!
coyotes,lvwfntw,2024-11-07 09:25:24,John Scott
coyotes,lvz0hmt,2024-11-07 16:50:55,I know it's still fuck SLC but would we consider Clayton Keller? over 500 games played 2nd all time in points 3rd all time in Goals and 3rd all time in assists
coyotes,lw0kjmw,2024-11-07 21:55:50,Mike Smith for sure
coyotes,lvxq8sd,2024-11-07 13:13:37,Ladislav Nagy 100%
coyotes,lvxyw3q,2024-11-07 13:53:35,I think Yands could be in the conversation.
coyotes,lvyjrby,2024-11-07 15:31:43,Vrbata and Michalek
coyotes,lvzz4wn,2024-11-07 19:55:06,Shane Done by FAR
coyotes,lw0n50f,2024-11-07 22:11:01,Alex Galchenyuk......./s
coyotes,lvuyndz,2024-11-07 01:52:08,He definitely doesn't deserve a spot in the ring of honor. His number's retired league wide so not much to do about that part of it. Also it's a shame the Yotes never officially retired 7 for Keith or 97 For Roenick.
coyotes,lvv14dg,2024-11-07 02:15:59,Wayne Gretzky is a major reason why our boys are in Salt Lake.
coyotes,lvwnkzg,2024-11-07 10:07:41,Amen on 94 & 49  Shottsy and Leighton are who give me motivation still everyday
coyotes,lvyy8sz,2024-11-07 16:40:13,OEL is definitely a must. I would say Vrbata as well. Shott is probably the most deserving of any candidate and that's not a knock on OEL at all but he did so much for the community here he deserves to be remembered forever.
coyotes,lvv41m4,2024-11-07 02:45:24,Also loved how it sounded when announcers said his name
coyotes,lvw1yt3,2024-11-07 08:04:15,This. I couldn’t have said it better
coyotes,lvyk4g7,2024-11-07 15:33:27,All Star Captain John Scott.  Give the man his due!
coyotes,lvwl2hx,2024-11-07 09:54:36,With how bad the team screwed his career he would probably pass. Biz would be a different story tho.
coyotes,lw0swps,2024-11-07 22:45:30,I would. Outside of his stats here Keller was a massive supporter of hockey in AZ and was one of the players publicly lobbying for the team to stay throughout the uncertainty.Not his fault they moved and from a franchise perspective he has the numbers to support inclusion alone.
coyotes,lw3cdpa,2024-11-08 10:32:54,Honestly this. Without him 2011-12 push would have never had happened. There were some just insane stops he had that year and the playoffs. He was one of hte best goalies that year maybe top 3. Unfortunately Quick was the best that year
coyotes,lw3c4ed,2024-11-08 10:31:36,LOL screwed his career? What Career? Scott was an enforcer out of 286 games played he had 5 goals. It was absurd that he was ever selected as All Star. Now maybe the coyotes should have embraced it for the publicity. But he was selected as a joke.
coyotes,lvt8kc2,2024-11-06 19:10:09,"I remember JR at a podium and he gave his middle finger to the arizona fans. Literally. I also remember when his ice time got reduced so much he was the ""extra"" and he left the bench and went out for a steak during the game he was on the bench as the extra guy."
coyotes,lvrrrcn,2024-11-06 14:54:22,That’s well deserved tbh he was one hell of a player who deserves to be in the HHOF
coyotes,lvsospi,2024-11-06 17:26:23,Love 27!!!
coyotes,lvsqjnd,2024-11-06 17:35:02,I still remember being a kid at the old Coyotes Family Carnival super excited to meet Keith Tkachuck and Jeremy Roenick. As closing time came I remember JR staying for like an extra hour just to make sure everyone who wanted a picture and an autograph got one. Dude was a total class act
coyotes,lvt8xd4,2024-11-06 19:12:07,I also remember one year during the offseason tkachuk gained so much weight his nickname was Tkachunky when he came back. 
coyotes,lvtr5hz,2024-11-06 20:50:58,JR aka Styles!  One of the best! He always made time for the kids and the fans!
coyotes,lwuqob4,2024-11-12 21:22:00,Personally I lost all respect for him.  During his time on the Flyers a reporter interviewed him about the lockout.  His response of “well players gotta get paid and got bills to pay” left a sour taste in my mouth. Your telling me on a million bucks you can’t pay your bills? He made it sound like players was only make 20k a year. That’s when I lost respect for him.  I liked him during his time in Chicago but his later years not so much.
coyotes,lvtgn4u,2024-11-06 19:53:50,I was there for that too. He was my favorite.

coyotes,lvlqzww,2024-11-05 17:44:09,Definitely against nobody goes out of their way to get a custom plate and doesn't get the yotes plate if they aren't for the yotes
coyotes,lvlrfm7,2024-11-05 17:46:27,Maybe his dog got eaten by a coyote and now he is seeking revenge.
coyotes,lvlubcf,2024-11-05 18:01:50,You can call and report his registration expired. 
coyotes,lvmxj56,2024-11-05 21:51:16,I think he is sad that there are NO Yotes just like most of us are! But I like to be positive and say just no Yotes for now. Hopefully that changes soon!!
coyotes,lvlzv61,2024-11-05 18:32:50,Maybe he couldn't get a Yotes plate in time lol
coyotes,lvlr9ub,2024-11-05 17:45:36,Jokes on him. If he cheers for an out of state team and wished for us to not have a team he now has no where to see his team play. Idiot
coyotes,lvm8jq3,2024-11-05 19:22:26,I’m thinking of retiring my Yotes plate this year but idk.
coyotes,lvmbcyz,2024-11-05 19:38:36,But again that would only really make sense if he got this place before the yotes left which is totally possible.I get it if someone anti yotes feels the need to get a custom plate to let others no they don't want a new yotes stadium in their town.But why would they have the plate after the yotes leave 
coyotes,lvmlknk,2024-11-05 20:39:18,I have a Yotes plate that’s personalized as a NJ Devil’s fan. I’m not trying to hurt anyones feelings I got the plate last year in a show of solidarity. I never disliked the Yotes and it definitely sucks that they’re not here. I was going to get a regular plate but I figured the Yotes plate would make a cool addition to memorabilia my collection one day.
coyotes,lvnf9xr,2024-11-05 23:40:41,I actually think that it’s because the custom plate is a 6 digit plate. They would have to say “NoYote” or something so if he specifically wanted Noyotes he can’t go custom.
coyotes,lvm0mux,2024-11-05 18:37:11,I think you can still get them right now...
coyotes,lvm3sdd,2024-11-05 18:54:50,He can move to UT they will take anybody. And a plus he can marry his cousin and his sister once he gets there.
coyotes,lvs21h1,2024-11-06 15:41:12,Nooo keep it alive!
coyotes,lvm0u8u,2024-11-05 18:38:21,I need to do that then asap
coyotes,lvs2x3g,2024-11-06 15:45:10,I wish I could revert back to the old plate. I never really liked the black one as much. I have the maroon one retired in my garage. I was gonna give it a friend.
coyotes,lvgkhhk,2024-11-04 21:43:49,Great player terrible coach.
coyotes,lvgm5dm,2024-11-04 21:53:35,Not as a coach. Absolute dogshit as a coach.
coyotes,lvgknd3,2024-11-04 21:44:47,And i hear his wife was one hell of a gambler/s
coyotes,lvgjsdl,2024-11-04 21:39:43,Honestly he didn’t help the team at all.
coyotes,lvh2v2u,2024-11-04 23:39:32,Great player pretty average at everything else with the safety net of being 99
coyotes,lvjqhkn,2024-11-05 11:50:12,Really cool!
coyotes,lvx92fg,2024-11-07 11:53:18,Terrible coach and owner. Leading to the downfall of ownership for the coyotes.
coyotes,lvgpbr2,2024-11-04 22:12:21,Agreed. When you're so good that the sport is second nature it makes it pretty tough for you to coach it.
coyotes,lvgoy8b,2024-11-04 22:10:05,Beat me to it.
coyotes,lvgppzy,2024-11-04 22:14:47,It really was the beginning of the end or at least the beginning of A LOT of problems.
coyotes,lvyzkbn,2024-11-07 16:46:31,Yep 100%. Moving to Glendale Dropping the Kachina and Gretzky owning/coaching sent the team into irrelevancy for so long and it was impossible to get back to where they were in the late 90s
coyotes,lvfrzrl,2024-11-04 18:58:39,Although that hurts seeing it it’s a pretty cool nod to the team.
coyotes,lvfyllr,2024-11-04 19:36:26,*sad awoo*
coyotes,lvgykbo,2024-11-04 23:10:14,Wish I could have played this past weekend and gotten a great souvenir tshirt such a great time
coyotes,lvgz9zu,2024-11-04 23:15:02,The shirts were handled differently this year. Attendees got a code to get a free short or discounted merch online ahead of the event.  I got my shirt weeks early. You can still order these of you want one https://store.drafttournament.com/collections/2024-tournaments?sort_by=created-descending
coyotes,lvgzfsj,2024-11-04 23:16:05,I’d feel like a poser wearing a shirt I didn’t earn. I think when I skated a couple years ago it was the same to get the shirt by pre order now that you mention it
coyotes,lvawg12,2024-11-03 23:50:51,RIP
coyotes,lvg667p,2024-11-04 20:20:31,Ouch.
coyotes,lva2smb,2024-11-03 20:31:53,Nice! Loved Smitty he’s one of my all time fav Yote too.
coyotes,lva4g5u,2024-11-03 20:41:52,Awesome dude!
coyotes,lveo8gf,2024-11-04 15:30:26,I was at a game where he ripped his mask off and tried to single-handedly fight the entire Ottawa Senators.His all-black pad setup in his final years here was sooo badass.
coyotes,lve97tv,2024-11-04 14:16:25,I was there for that game. Man what a crowd.
coyotes,lvgje7z,2024-11-04 21:37:19,The  I loved how quick he would jump in to fights lmao
coyotes,lv9xs78,2024-11-03 20:01:29,Nice. Fuck Utah.
coyotes,lv9z4oe,2024-11-03 20:09:33,I hate that now that new era has the license we won’t get a coyotes hat unless it’s a retro one
coyotes,lva0nlt,2024-11-03 20:18:53, Glad you found something. Thanks for helping keep the Yotes alive
coyotes,lvadpki,2024-11-03 21:38:17,damn I love that hat. I want one.
coyotes,lva9nzb,2024-11-03 21:13:20,I have this cap too and it’s great really sharp
coyotes,lva0jzh,2024-11-03 20:18:16,It sucks so bad. I love new era hats and a Yotes one would go so hard
coyotes,lvasbg9,2024-11-03 23:17:49,Forever! Started watching hockey 5-6 years ago and as I probably was one of the 3 people who watch NHL in Mexico I had no idea were to start but as I found there was a hockey team in the middle of the desert with a beautiful tradition and cultural significance I knew I was on the right place! Always dreamed about visiting Yotes but I leave the city with a unique and wonderful experience. Hope to visit again soon!!!
coyotes,lvaslal,2024-11-03 23:19:55,It’s amazing! Love at first sight as there was like only 3 left the best hat in my collection by far.
coyotes,lvbxd6z,2024-11-04 06:21:49,Preach
floridapanthers,lxsop5d,2024-11-18 13:39:13,Was that the one with the butterflies on it? If so the trailer outside had the shirt. Didn’t see hats though. Wasn’t seeking it out but remembered thinking “oh they still have those?”EDIT: I took a look at the website and they have a lot of hats that would fit the description- I’d say take a look there.
floridapanthers,lxu58nl,2024-11-18 18:09:04,My wife also had a homicidal titty.  Here’s some pics from last week the store on the upper levelhttps://i.imgur.com/m3VgezO.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/4c3EcHN.jpg
floridapanthers,lxsqb62,2024-11-18 13:47:20,Just general pink in the rink stuff imo it looks cooler than the hockey fights cancer line. If they have the shirt maybe they'll have some extra stock of other things elsewhere. If anything I saw they had stuff online but don't think it'd ship in time for the game :(
floridapanthers,lxu9dpx,2024-11-18 18:32:59,Thanks for the pics! And I love the description hope your wife is doing good otherwise
floridapanthers,lxt6i9i,2024-11-18 15:08:47,If its instock on their site either the arena store or the practice facility store would have it in stock.
floridapanthers,lxua4aq,2024-11-18 18:37:18,She’s doing great thank you!
floridapanthers,lxoe3n4,2024-11-17 19:14:31,Wait until Black Friday- authentics will most certainly be 25-40% on Fanatics/NHL.com
floridapanthers,lxobyze,2024-11-17 19:02:13,If you are local wouldSuggest going to the panthers store at the Baptist ice plex in holiday park
floridapanthers,lxpomhq,2024-11-18 00:15:47,I’ve gotten some fantastic ones on Dhgate lmao
floridapanthers,lxs6rl5,2024-11-18 12:09:16,There are 3 types. All 3 are fanatics labeled. First and cheapest is called a breakaway jersey and for men the blanks retail price is $134.99. Next is called premium which retail for $179.99. Premiums are close but not quite what they were on the ice and are made in Indonesia. The final one is called Authentic Pro and those retail at $424.99 and are made in Canada. They are what the players wear on the ice. The prices I'm citing here are from fanatics.com but you will find them at the team store for more money. I think premium on sale is probably the best 'value' lets call it. Unless they are really into jerseys I wouldn't think the added cost to go to Authentic Pro is worth it. People telling you to try dhgate are pointing you toward fakes that are easily discernable as fakes next to the real ones. I would not gift a fake but that is for you to decide. As someone stated below Breakaway and Premiums are likely to be available through sales but Authentic Pro I'm not sure about. Some specialty coupon codes work on all of them if you happen to have one. Good luck!
floridapanthers,lxo5o28,2024-11-17 18:25:17,Are you trying to get an authentic one (where the sizes are in numbers) or a replica (where the sizes are small medium large etc)
floridapanthers,lxqlamv,2024-11-18 05:53:33,Fanatics Premium jerseys are just fine. They typically have 30% off sales every couple days. That’s your best bet.
floridapanthers,lxrve9p,2024-11-18 11:10:56,Dhgate
floridapanthers,lxsytu8,2024-11-18 14:29:51,There is also flateamshop.com which basically ships out all of the products they carry in the arena and various team shops in Florida.
floridapanthers,lxtb3ts,2024-11-18 15:32:21,Don't buy a hat from New Era directly. They're claiming they are inundated with orders and so they cannot get my hat into a box for like 2 weeks. Great way to run a company.
floridapanthers,lxtlmjn,2024-11-18 16:25:12,My fanatics jersey is actually better than my addidas primegreen IMO. The adidas logo was super stiff and I didnt like how the shoulders fit. Fanatics feels like a glove
floridapanthers,lxo923u,2024-11-17 18:45:10,I kind of know nothing about jerseys (and little about hockey) but I assume (from what I found from a quick search) is a replica? unless there’s a big deal or difference that a fan would want a replica? My friend mostly just wants something to wear to games if that helps!
floridapanthers,lxm94lq,2024-11-17 12:12:08,But per the Winnipeg announcer the hit was a clean hip check?
floridapanthers,lxm9rfm,2024-11-17 12:15:40,Must have been mad they found out how fraudulent they were last night. They’re good but they are not win a best of 7 four times in a row good. They’ll make it to at most the WCF.
floridapanthers,lxmmaya,2024-11-17 13:24:26,He hip checked his freaking knee. That's insane
floridapanthers,lxlzj5i,2024-11-17 11:19:17,Would be a great time to have a Gudas on the team to dish out some justice on Tuesday
floridapanthers,lxmdcc5,2024-11-17 12:35:35,Fucking good
floridapanthers,lxn7kru,2024-11-17 15:17:28,Good that was a sc_mb_g move he will get his come next meeting Tuesday
floridapanthers,lxn7nhw,2024-11-17 15:17:53,Should’ve been a penalty but not really a huge deal IMO. Definitely low but don’t think it was malicious or anything
floridapanthers,lxmv9qs,2024-11-17 14:11:00,serves him right
floridapanthers,lxmauw5,2024-11-17 12:21:48,They remind me a lot of 2021 Florida.  Great for regular season  might win the Presidents Trophy but not built for playoff hockey.
floridapanthers,lxmvdno,2024-11-17 14:11:34,ohhhvverrraaated!!  
floridapanthers,lxm07vt,2024-11-17 11:23:05,We have a Gadjovich.
floridapanthers,lxo0xgi,2024-11-17 17:57:39,Pionk gets $5K Reaves gets five games what's next?
floridapanthers,lxmb5x9,2024-11-17 12:23:29,Exactly the last four years of Cats hockey are a great study on a what a team looks like when it’s ready to win. Same thing with Jersey that team is coached by Sheldon Keefe and still seems too soft to win a best of 7 past round two.
floridapanthers,lxmvn4k,2024-11-17 14:12:55,seriously...there's def a clear progressive development to study in retrospect
floridapanthers,lxlyt9j,2024-11-17 11:15:16,seems like the Jets missed it too
floridapanthers,lxmxe59,2024-11-17 14:22:07,Espn+
floridapanthers,lxlov0e,2024-11-17 10:18:11,Nhl66 .ir will have the replay
floridapanthers,lxqcn20,2024-11-18 04:18:21,Hopefully you can watch it again on the 19th.
floridapanthers,lxmtl7i,2024-11-17 14:02:18,not working

floridapanthers,lxl1iyu,2024-11-17 07:32:51,Thank you!! I know it's s bit much but then again is it though lol
floridapanthers,lxl3v8t,2024-11-17 07:53:00,It sure is!! You're lucky! What an absolute honor to shake a legends hand!!

floridapanthers,lxjsiid,2024-11-16 23:59:53,Me likely this
floridapanthers,lxjfc2h,2024-11-16 22:23:43,Thank you for this! My rawr stream broke down after the Barkov goal and missed the rest of the game!
floridapanthers,lxkcjw8,2024-11-17 03:04:48,Place was packed keep it going guy!
floridapanthers,lxl3uhs,2024-11-17 07:52:50,The overrated chant was *chef's kiss* perfect

floridapanthers,lxl6nmg,2024-11-17 08:14:59,Back when I lived there Grails always had the Panthers on. Granted this was 2021. I don't see why it'd have changed though.
floridapanthers,lxjts06,2024-11-17 00:10:07,Sports social at dolphin is decent and has a shit load of TVs
floridapanthers,lxspbxq,2024-11-18 13:42:24,Barracuda’s in Coconut Grove is a great spot that shows them. Sandbar sports grill is around the corner and shows them too
floridapanthers,lxsq0t1,2024-11-18 13:45:53,Know Cuda’s well from my UM days 
floridapanthers,lxj9vim,2024-11-16 21:47:16,Barkov playing the best hockey of his career since Finland. This guy is on a different level right now
floridapanthers,lxjfm1v,2024-11-16 22:25:33,And that’s Panthers hockey folks perfect win
floridapanthers,lxjhsbz,2024-11-16 22:40:33,That game was such a palate cleanser from the previous two games.  I still couldn’t believe we lost both games to NJ in such fashion.  That was hard to swallow. Anyways hopefully the next game will be a pleasant dessert.
floridapanthers,lxj9w63,2024-11-16 21:47:23,They win a championship and are putting together yet another fun season the Florida Panthers are ridiculous.
floridapanthers,lxja9jo,2024-11-16 21:49:53,That was a rush needed that after last week. Hopefully everyone who was panicking can bottle this and remember it’s a long season and we are most likely not going to win then rest of our games 
floridapanthers,lxjbv2f,2024-11-16 22:00:28,Did you guys watch what i just watched. Shut out the number 1 team. We are back babbbbbbyyyyyyhyy
floridapanthers,lxjf9kk,2024-11-16 22:23:16,Couldn’t ask for a better night. Defense was absolutely dominant and the game played to our script the whole time.A shame Winny resorts to bitching out when they lose
floridapanthers,lxjpaw7,2024-11-16 23:35:10,First live game of the season for me couldn’t be more proud of the boys :)

floridapanthers,lxje9o8,2024-11-16 22:16:36,Best team in the league
floridapanthers,lxjbut6,2024-11-16 22:00:25,Outstanding bounce back from the previous two games.Chefs fuckin' kiss 
floridapanthers,lxjaj7c,2024-11-16 21:51:40,Great game!  BoB was a brick wall and we were firing on all cylinders!! 5-0!
floridapanthers,lxjsog4,2024-11-17 00:01:12,bob was so key on the breakout handled the puck really well behind the net
floridapanthers,lxjtwqq,2024-11-17 00:11:14,Panthers woke up and started that top tier pounce attack! Back to normal schedule programming = Getting W's.
floridapanthers,lxjd3d5,2024-11-16 22:08:46,My wife and I are Stars fans in from Texas for work. Awesome crowd and atmosphere! Not to mention that the game had great pace and was super entertaining for a 5-0 final.  My one complaint is the rideshare situation. The driver (and we) could not figure out where to drop off and it’s super difficult to find the right exit for rideshare after the game. We wound up having to walk all the way around the arena and still ask for directions.  Super fun on the whole though y’all!
floridapanthers,lxjaciw,2024-11-16 21:50:26,O Captain! My Captain!
floridapanthers,lxjay1a,2024-11-16 21:54:23,Feels really good. ACAB does not include Bobby
floridapanthers,lxjbw3c,2024-11-16 22:00:39,Kicked the best team in the league’s ass. Got damn.
floridapanthers,lxjapdw,2024-11-16 21:52:48,Happy to see our boys show out after those horrible Devil games. They looked motivated to send a message tonight. Glad to see it. Let's go on another win streak!
floridapanthers,lxj9luo,2024-11-16 21:45:30,eyy
floridapanthers,lxj9u7w,2024-11-16 21:47:00,Clinic
floridapanthers,lxjaktc,2024-11-16 21:51:58,I know some people don't like the 4 nations faceoff but I for one can't wait to see him captaining Team Finland
floridapanthers,lxlbelx,2024-11-17 08:50:08,He’s been amazing since he came back from the injury!! Making up for lost time
floridapanthers,lxjacso,2024-11-16 21:50:28,There were really people freaking out cause we lost a couple games to a good team?
floridapanthers,lxjg9ft,2024-11-16 22:30:02,They went out sad.
floridapanthers,lxjunac,2024-11-17 00:17:21,We might start a gofundme to get you to the rest of them.
floridapanthers,lxkahd6,2024-11-17 02:42:37,So what most locals do is park at Sawgrass (giant mall across the street).  Ive never done rideshare at the arena so had no clue it was annoying.
floridapanthers,lxkc2cm,2024-11-17 02:59:34,We are the best team in the league...
floridapanthers,lxjcor5,2024-11-16 22:06:01,I’m gonna sleep so fucking good tonight
floridapanthers,lxjjab9,2024-11-16 22:50:37,I’m more excited about the 4 nations face off then I would be for the all star game and skills competition

floridapanthers,lxl2w1v,2024-11-17 07:44:48,Yeah I read about that on this sub before the game! Problem is (1) our work group only has two rental vans and they were both already in use and (2) we like to drink at games lol so we always rideshare or use public transit
floridapanthers,lxl1b1q,2024-11-17 07:30:52,![gif](giphy|xUPGcgorgprluHvGUg|downsized)I’m kicking my ass do you mind?!

floridapanthers,lxkuom7,2024-11-17 06:25:31,Playoff Cats showed up. That’s all I’m going to say. I’ll be nice
floridapanthers,lxkrskw,2024-11-17 05:54:07,This was a sweet game from beginning to end...a masterpiece performance by the Cats!!!
floridapanthers,lxmxclu,2024-11-17 14:21:53,It was my first hockey game ever. I’m glad I was there for that what a show last night.
floridapanthers,lxl3s3v,2024-11-17 07:52:17,Was here last night ! Amazing to watch the cats man handle the “best team in hockey”

floridapanthers,lxkxwcz,2024-11-17 06:58:42,I saw some of the complaining in r/hockey people are so ridiculous. It's just funny banter.Jets are a good team and if they return the favor in similar fashion on Tuesday surely their fans will let everyone know about it. And it'll be funny.It was great to see the cats return to form against a good team after those tough losses against Jersey.
floridapanthers,lxkup1z,2024-11-17 06:25:38,Well we have a banner and most of the teams fans don't so why does anyone care what they think about attendance? 
floridapanthers,lxjcf0g,2024-11-16 22:04:12,"And this time it didn't backfire like when the Jets fans said ""Pull Georgiev""."
floridapanthers,lxmo3ga,2024-11-17 13:33:53,Brought my horn for the first time and said I’d only blow it when we got a goal hoped for the best then we got 5It was glorious

floridapanthers,lxj5gyy,2024-11-16 21:18:05,There’s game recaps on YouTube they show pretty much everything important.
floridapanthers,lxpc8yj,2024-11-17 22:45:23,ESPN+ keeps reruns of games for a while afterwards
floridapanthers,lxj6m6y,2024-11-16 21:25:39,Hmm then I wonder if it's WSFL's fault. Or they're both using the same provider and it's fucked on their end. Thanks.

floridapanthers,lxj4rfr,2024-11-16 21:13:23,Don’t think the Jets want to come back to Florida any time soon. 
floridapanthers,lxiqqdl,2024-11-16 19:44:32,fine ill buy a samo jersey
floridapanthers,lxiz5ky,2024-11-16 20:37:22,It was never over.Nevertheless we’re so back
floridapanthers,lxj07fh,2024-11-16 20:43:57,Also Gus is cooking with some freaking jet fuel defensively
floridapanthers,lxiyxil,2024-11-16 20:35:58,I think E-Rod just pairs so well with Barkov and Reinhart given his grit and high IQ. I was missing this line combination the past few games
floridapanthers,lxj08w1,2024-11-16 20:44:12,Bob really has no idea the work he’s been doing for my mental health this year

floridapanthers,lxfl2yl,2024-11-16 08:59:47,Anyway you slice it this is going to be a tough game for the Cats but we've seen how good they can be and at that level I think they can beat these Jets. Let's hope the work out whatever funk plagued them during the Devils games.
floridapanthers,lxfmbsi,2024-11-16 09:08:11,I hate being second on a visiting teams B2B Florida trip. Script reads the same all the time. Team flys in gets spanked by Tampa and we get the pissed off version of that team instead of the jet lagged one
floridapanthers,lxiyyty,2024-11-16 20:36:12,Reinhart is inevitable
floridapanthers,lxj4xaf,2024-11-16 21:14:29,The boys are all heart and work tonight!
floridapanthers,lxj63i9,2024-11-16 21:22:10,So for Samo I think he's a fantastic 4th line guy and could even move up to the 3rd line.  I don't think he's ready for 2nd line yet but he's getting way better the more he stays strong on the puck.
floridapanthers,lxiyqwy,2024-11-16 20:34:49,Time for our PK to get back on track!
floridapanthers,lxizuuz,2024-11-16 20:41:44,Where has this team been the last 2 games?

floridapanthers,lxillkh,2024-11-16 19:12:56,I always thought Canada’s national anthem was YYZ
floridapanthers,lxinihv,2024-11-16 19:24:45,Anyone got a game stream?
floridapanthers,lxipouf,2024-11-16 19:38:08,Balinskis take a nut shot?
floridapanthers,lxiq12f,2024-11-16 19:40:14,WTF ESPN+ literally cuts to break mid action...
floridapanthers,lxio8tn,2024-11-16 19:29:13,I don’t know if it’s just me but I’d prefer Gadjovich in the lineup over Nosek…
floridapanthers,lxj5oj7,2024-11-16 21:19:26,Omgggg that’s fantastic hahahaaahhahaa
floridapanthers,lxj08mh,2024-11-16 20:44:09, is on 
floridapanthers,lxir5qt,2024-11-16 19:47:08,I was so happy to hear he was in tonight instead of Gadjovich- clearly the right decision. I really love Samo
floridapanthers,lxirbue,2024-11-16 19:48:12,he plays like a brand new Jake Guentzel
floridapanthers,lxizcdr,2024-11-16 20:38:33,Way too early to panicBut bah gawd are we back
floridapanthers,lxgxr2x,2024-11-16 13:35:20,They also gave Connor the night off in Tampa
floridapanthers,lxiywxv,2024-11-16 20:35:52,doesn't get much better than that

floridapanthers,lxj0ngn,2024-11-16 20:46:44,Right like were they conserving their energy for this one or something
floridapanthers,lxitf6s,2024-11-16 20:01:11,He’s definitely making his case for keeping himself in the lineup. Love to see it
floridapanthers,lxisyza,2024-11-16 19:58:20,Its sad to hear cus im a huge lomberghini guy. But im really excited that samo has been a absolute beast. Hes been absolutely doing work and i approve it. Lets go cats
floridapanthers,lxl1cb1,2024-11-17 07:31:11,I was so worried coming into this game after NJ (also can we talk about how nasty some of the devils fans were) - this game was just glorious. And now none of us can speak because our voices are gone. Like the Jets dignity.
floridapanthers,lxje06i,2024-11-16 22:14:52,I knew the team would get it back together!! That’s why I didn’t listen to the dooming. Team is back on track now!!
floridapanthers,lxj8gg9,2024-11-16 21:37:51,Not a fun game for them to watch let them cope
floridapanthers,lxir5oe,2024-11-16 19:47:07,they need to get Mark Morrison's *Return Of The Mac* playing whenever he scores
floridapanthers,lxjebkp,2024-11-16 22:16:57,We lead the league in shorthanded goals!!!
floridapanthers,lxinsgd,2024-11-16 19:26:26,Already not getting it with that Swaggy penalty.
floridapanthers,lxgr4dq,2024-11-16 13:00:11,We're still competitive but 5 LHD and 1 RHD is definitely a problem if you are looking to contend. You can make 2 and 4 work with 1 same side pairing but 2 same side will have issues against top tier teams that can exploit the weak sideWe are better defensively when Mikkola is anchoring the 2nd pair and Kulikov is anchoring the 3rd pair instead of playing together. I'm sure Zito will be looking to add a 2nd pair RHD at the deadline if one is available for a reasonable cost
floridapanthers,lxihf4e,2024-11-16 18:47:16,I want to see boqvist againDrop kuli to third pair so we have a more offensive guy to pair w him and mikkola
floridapanthers,lxhuqk6,2024-11-16 16:33:57,Uvis has looked a little shaky the past 2 games and Ekblad is and always has been a liability.
floridapanthers,lxirhri,2024-11-16 19:49:13,Hellebuyck basically carries the team
floridapanthers,lxj2grr,2024-11-16 20:58:20,Woah oh oh oh oh
floridapanthers,lxj6ytb,2024-11-16 21:28:00,That was the equivalent of getting it over with on both their behalf’s lol
floridapanthers,lxj6ngf,2024-11-16 21:25:52,Yes. Forsling took the hit.
floridapanthers,lxj82g7,2024-11-16 21:35:13,Just thinking that too. He’s been invisible the last 3 games.
floridapanthers,lxj8dh3,2024-11-16 21:37:17,He doesn’t play so aggressively any longer to begin with and Bennett is really driving the line. He’s lost that spark but he’s still dependable.
floridapanthers,lxj8gkb,2024-11-16 21:37:52,he just seems sorta non-existent lately
floridapanthers,lxj9ml7,2024-11-16 21:45:38,Dude had a long summer without anything to prove early in the year lol. Give him some time
floridapanthers,lxihhyi,2024-11-16 18:47:46,Amen
floridapanthers,lxikzbf,2024-11-16 19:09:12,Go out and board some one !!! lolhttps://preview.redd.it/9jb771hxsc1e1.jpeg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f027302ccf4765dd30d55a5c655790c94a1cfb80
floridapanthers,lxj7xsn,2024-11-16 21:34:22,Yeah but it's more that Bennett always handles the puck like he has no fear so he just bulldozes through people.
floridapanthers,lxj8vt0,2024-11-16 21:40:41,Ok. That one was legit.
floridapanthers,lxinimg,2024-11-16 19:24:46,I thought he had gotten the monkey off his back with that multi-goal game a while back but that does not appear to be the case.
floridapanthers,lxjostz,2024-11-16 23:31:15,He hasn't been the same since his buddy Johnny gaudreau died
floridapanthers,lxo2qba,2024-11-17 18:08:00,Maybe what kept him out for 5 games is still bothering him?
floridapanthers,lxiha65,2024-11-16 18:46:25,I showed up at 5:30 thinking the same thing
floridapanthers,lxijjqj,2024-11-16 19:00:24,I have the original schedule screenshot and it was always 7
floridapanthers,lxinwp7,2024-11-16 19:27:09,Dm’d
floridapanthers,lxjeh1m,2024-11-16 22:17:57,Yeahh…no time for the dooming…we’re Cats…we bounce back 
floridapanthers,lxhl1w1,2024-11-16 15:41:07,Assuming Adam boqvist was supposed to fill that need but maybe not working out how they had hoped. I trust zito will find something by the deadline
floridapanthers,lxlpnk6,2024-11-17 10:22:54,Yea my bil and I were talking about this and Verhaeghe not scoring as much as usual last night. At the end of the day as long as they show up in the playoffs I can live with a quiet regular season.
floridapanthers,lxmwh79,2024-11-17 14:17:19,The alcohol and otherwise just wore off

SeattleNHL,fz134j8,2020-07-23 18:37:17,In terms of the draft i'm still hearing the rules will be identical to the Vegas draft rules except I believe Vegas is exempt from losing any players to Seattle.Stealing this from another person's answer:> For the new people that may just be getting into ice hockey here is a basic youtube video on the rules of hockey: it does get some slight things wrong or slightly different. but thats the more advanced stuff and doesn't make a huge difference. Don't listen to the whole penalty shot section https://youtu.be/nv2FUnHceqU
SeattleNHL,fz163s7,2020-07-23 19:03:06,I'd recommend following the r/hockey subreddit. It's a great sub to learn from. The easiest way to learn the game would probably be to buy the NHL game on ps4/xbox and play it. If you don't play games you'll just have to learn while watching and don't be afraid to ask questions.
SeattleNHL,fzu8oyz,2020-07-31 03:08:21,My guess is to start watching hockey Now.  Go to nhl66.ir   I’d recommend watching Canucks cause you’re gonna see a lot of them
SeattleNHL,fz13f6z,2020-07-23 18:39:50,Good to know! Thanks!! So how does the special draft work then?

SeattleNHL,fz18vsb,2020-07-23 19:27:10,Kraken will select 1 player from each team except for VGK.(so 30 total players). The must select at least 14 Forwards 9 Defensemen and 3 Goalies.The 30 teams they are choosing from have a 2 different options of restrict the players Seattle can choose. they can protect:1. 7 forwards 3 defencemen and 1 goalie2. ANY 8 skaters and 1 goalie. So if they decide they have more than 3 D that they want to protect then they really expose their forward lines. 7 teams out of the 30 chose to go with option 2 during the Vegas draft.
SeattleNHL,fz3ecj2,2020-07-24 10:36:22,Gotcha thanks!
SeattleNHL,fz0yf3s,2020-07-23 17:57:41,oh shit. someone circled it earlier but i didnt realize they were looking at the negative space.

SeattleNHL,fz1xpnu,2020-07-23 23:21:21,Yes. And as somebody else pointed out the negative space at the bottom looks like a sockeye jaw. I'll still wear my Bitch Pigeons shirt but can't wait for the jersey (sweater).
SeattleNHL,fzf3hed,2020-07-27 12:39:31,That stupid fucking name sounds like a team for girls roller derby.I wish they would put it to rest too.
SeattleNHL,fz0x08e,2020-07-23 17:46:03,Disagree. Logo came out this morning.
SeattleNHL,fz143q1,2020-07-23 18:45:42,Name: Turd-Logo:  Turd-Colors:  TurdJersey: Turd-Honestly the whole thing looks like it was put together by a 13 year old a week after learning photoshop.  The Name is shit and just makes me depressed for the city of Seattle. Just when I thought there was nothing left in Seattle for Californians to ruin they go ahead and do this. Sucks cause I look forward to getting into NHL in Seattle.
SeattleNHL,fz0pfbd,2020-07-23 16:43:14,Name: F. Literally the only one I hatedLogo: B+. I actually like it.... until the red eye. It basically takes a really clean look and cheapens it. The anchor is actually pretty nice. Colors: B. Hate the red. The blues are nuce but I think there's just 1 too many colors. Either lose the red and go all blue or lose the red and a blue and add a green or a grey. Jersey: I'd have to see it on a person. But because I dislike the red that plays into my opinion.Before people claim i have my pee-pants on I'm a big Seattle fan but I think there's a lot of shit with our teams that I dislike.  The names have not been one of them. It's a meme.
SeattleNHL,fz0q2ig,2020-07-23 16:48:27,Name: A while yes it doesn’t check the box of local name there is enough of a through line that can grow into itLogo: A++ I love the less is more approach to it. The secondary logo is great so obvious that it’s surprising it wasn’t used before if the mariners had it we would have one the World Series 30 years agoColors: B+ a little too many blues but close enough to each other it’s not jarring and drifting into Oklahoma Thunder disasterJersey: A. Sharp as heck
SeattleNHL,fz11jnj,2020-07-23 18:23:51,Name: A. Fun theme. I expect some epic ice projections to develop at home games. Lots of potential coolness with the themeAnchor Logo: A+. I *really* dig the anchor i liked it the second I saw it on the shoulders then when seeing the Space Needle as part of it it got even cooler.S Logo: B+. Connection to Metropolitans History is dope. Using JUST a tentacle to form the S would've been a little cheesy and wouldn't have lasted as long so I like the direction they went. The Red eye and the shitty fan fiction like explanation they wrote for it is the cheesy part. I think it looks better without the eye. Colors: A+. Clean. Crisp. they just did an all around good job with this.Sweaters: A-/B+. I'll be pretty pumped to pick one up once released as I said i dig the color scheme. the color bands just feel too large. I wish the away sweater didnt mimic the home exactly on the arm transitioning back to the Deep Sea Blue at the end. and the Ice Blue on the mockups of the aways just don't look as good. but I may change my opinion when they are put on the ice. By comparison [the Sharks have a basic arm band and it looks fantastic and REALLY clean without all the busyness that they used to have.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18196645/1089273422.jpg.jpg)EDIT: i think a 3rd jersey with the Ice Blue as primary color might look really cool also. I'd like to see that mocked up.
SeattleNHL,fz14fly,2020-07-23 18:48:32,Name: A+ This is the name I always wanted so I'm happy they went in the correct directionLogo: A+ That is a freaking great logo that calls back to the Metropolitans and will look great on a jersey hat whatever. The anchor logo is pretty stylish too.Colors: B- The colors are good individually but together they make me feel something that is slightly uncomfortable for reasons I can't put a finger to. I would have preferred them to mix in some green somehow. It seems in keeping with the other teams in the areas (-Mariners)Jersey: A- Love the design with the classic arm bands. It loses out some points because of the colors. It doesn't miss enough points that I won't buy one or two though.
SeattleNHL,fz0lfcv,2020-07-23 16:11:30,"F-Don't like a single thing about any of it. Was literally on my list of ""please don't choose this name"" when it was consistently tossed into the mix of names here."
SeattleNHL,fz7wimt,2020-07-25 14:35:08,I’m with you.  It’s clear our opinion is not popular which is fine but I just hate it.  The colors are pretty good but the name and logo I just can’t get past.  I’m trying to force myself to like it and hoping it grows on me but it really just screams 2002 ECHL team.  And already partnering with Kraken Spiced Rum?  It just seems so gimmicky to me and I fear that’ll wear off quickly.I dunno.  I’m gonna cheer for them for sure and I’m ecstatic about having the NHL here.  But I couldn’t even stomach buying merchandise because I hate it so much haha.
SeattleNHL,fz0mk4r,2020-07-23 16:20:23,How do you look at the jerseys and not like them at least a little??
SeattleNHL,fz148l8,2020-07-23 18:46:50,Because they’re lame and super basic. It’s pretty much everything that is wrong with Seattle’s current culture. It’s representative of Disney-fication of everything that is/was authentically PNW.
SeattleNHL,fz1918i,2020-07-23 19:28:30,A third Navy blue team how original. A giant squid monster with no real lore tied to Seattle. It's just a big swing and a miss to me. Absolutely nuked my excitement for the franchise.
SeattleNHL,fz0s64b,2020-07-23 17:05:52,This is something we are currently talking with other subs about. Aesthetics for the sub are in the works as well but we're waiting to see what's going to happen.

SeattleNHL,fz19dsd,2020-07-23 19:31:29,Is it possible to rename a sub or would we have to migrate over to the new one?

SeattleNHL,fz1baez,2020-07-23 19:48:12,I don't think that it's possible to rename a sub so we are probably going to start encouraging people to move to the new sub soon.
SeattleNHL,fz0hsjp,2020-07-23 15:43:32,Good point. He absolutely was the one pushing hard for that name. I wasn’t crazy about the name but the branding looks sharp and it’s a fun name that they can market well. They’re going to sell a ton of merch.
